@faisalislam If they vote Labour they will be. Miliband's only hope of Downing Street is if Sturgeon puts him there. Sat Apr 18 14:32:21 BST 2015
Really unpleasant outbreak of illegal flyposting in centre of Beverley today. Hope those responsible can afford the fines. Sat Apr 18 09:04:10 BST 2015
I'm fundraising for @stmarysbeverley on @JustGiving. Please #sponsorme & RT http://t.co/zLNIOXcqGo Fri Apr 17 18:06:06 BST 2015
Being attacked by lunatic left extremists should be a gift to Miliband. But, somehow he just lacks authenticity and makes them look good. Thu Apr 16 21:24:03 BST 2015
Sturgeon will boss any Labour government. She's a natural and Miliband is so, so something else. Thu Apr 16 21:20:32 BST 2015
The Left can't bear the idea that ordinary working people get help to buy their own home. Nothing, it seems, makes them angrier. Tue Apr 14 07:20:15 BST 2015
@dylanwiliam @tes Trying to distil anything from what an academic tells you must be one of the most dangerous sports. Mon Apr 13 17:14:25 BST 2015
@JamesPBLloyd Form guide: judge on track record. Leopards & spots. Labour always wrecks the economy & puts more on dole. Always. Mon Apr 13 15:17:21 BST 2015
Labour's peculiar manifesto. More borrowing, more debt but less for NHS. #VoteConservative Mon Apr 13 13:06:19 BST 2015
Imagine what the Miliband/Salmond, Labour/SNP tag team would do to our puny public finances. Labour alone was bad enough. Next @WWE mayhem. Mon Apr 13 10:35:40 BST 2015
Having forgotten the deficit in his speech @Ed_Miliband nearly left it out of manifesto too. Congrats to whoever reminded him. @BBCAllegra Mon Apr 13 10:19:56 BST 2015
@gogetemfloyd Perhaps I'm wrong about the lie. Perhaps they mean to be responsible, every single time. It's just that they never are. Mon Apr 13 09:44:06 BST 2015
Every Labour manifesto says they'll be financially responsible. Every Labour government proves that's a lie. Mon Apr 13 09:24:48 BST 2015
@Clackypaul Pretty bad headwinds on the way back but Club Sandwich and chips at the Nags Head made everything OK. Sun Apr 12 15:53:37 BST 2015
Looking forward to giving out prizes at Hornsea Third Marathon. Funds to Marie Curie. Organised by Hornsea Rotary. Sun Apr 12 11:32:30 BST 2015
So Labour cut NHS in Wales, wanted to do same here and now rule out matching Conservative increases. Miliband is no good. Sun Apr 12 10:13:33 BST 2015
@MesserStanton The NHS protected by Tories. The NHS in Wales damaged. Today. Couldn't be more current. Follow facts. Vote Conservative. Sun Apr 12 08:34:28 BST 2015
@MesserStanton There haven't been any. Except in Wales. Budget in England up Â£13 billion. Imagine damage if Labour ran NHS here too. Sun Apr 12 08:28:13 BST 2015
@MesserStanton @Wnicholasgomes Labour wanted to cut NHS in England. Tories stopped it. Labour have cut NHS in Wales. Care damaged - there. Sun Apr 12 08:26:59 BST 2015
@MesserStanton @Wnicholasgomes A culture of secrecy and cover up. Targets ahead of compassion. Yes it's Labour's fault. See Wales. Sun Apr 12 08:24:03 BST 2015
Never forget the victims of Mid Staffs or that Labour wanted to cut the NHS. The NHS is safe in Conservative hands. http://t.co/blWo6odNjP Sun Apr 12 08:11:17 BST 2015
@carllygo Just a pity their job destroying policies will mean there aren't any jobs to be guided to. Thu Apr 09 11:54:38 BST 2015
@ayestotheright Good piece. Doesn't reflect on need for chair to be trusted as fair by all. If that is lost then honourable person would go. Thu Apr 09 11:17:00 BST 2015
@TristramHuntMP What a shame Labour's anti business policies will mean there won't be any jobs to be guided to. Thu Apr 09 11:09:35 BST 2015
@CareersDefender It is welcome. But the best careers advice in the world will be useless if Miliband destroys the jobs recovery - again. Thu Apr 09 11:05:28 BST 2015
It's not just job security which Miliband threatens http://t.co/us9U3sstxk Thu Apr 09 10:55:48 BST 2015
Labour's false prospectus leaves real issues unaddressed. http://t.co/tUsN1Se3ku Tue Apr 07 09:47:59 BST 2015
@TomBlenkinsop You wanted to cut NHS budget, we protected it. In Wales you cut it 8%. Now you're lying about it. http://t.co/hlRDhRlqrd Tue Apr 07 09:11:23 BST 2015
@TomBlenkinsop In Wales. Tue Apr 07 08:47:15 BST 2015
@AndyCavster You really ought to remove that. Sun Apr 05 13:27:03 BST 2015
Every year we see growing public confidence in teachers. Then Easter comes. Sun Apr 05 13:18:59 BST 2015
@Puffles2010 Too often Labour excuse personal abuse. Miliband should take action & discipline the candidate. @patel4witham Sat Apr 04 18:59:09 BST 2015
Good for Priti Patel @patel4witham for standing up against the negativity, smears and bullying of her Labour opponent.http://t.co/pHMtwUz5P7 Sat Apr 04 18:07:00 BST 2015
Nicola Sturgeon wasn't supporting David Cameron. Just saying how much better he is than Ed Miliband. Stating the bleeding obvious. Sat Apr 04 10:17:28 BST 2015
Business is fleeing Labour's hard left, job destroying policies. But it'll be the poor who pay the price in lost services, jobs & hope. Thu Apr 02 08:28:38 BST 2015
@DeirdreTalks Deidre you have been inspirational and effective. The quality mark will help move standards up. Congratulations all round. Thu Mar 26 12:04:39 GMT 2015

@Nick5307 I've read it. It doesn't say not to use them. Recommends careful construction as here. Tue Mar 24 16:19:42 GMT 2015
@Nick5307 Where does it say that? Tue Mar 24 15:05:44 GMT 2015
@Nick5307 How should it take context into account? Tue Mar 24 10:56:13 GMT 2015

The take home pay of someone in minimum wage job has gone up 20% under Conservatives. More jobs. More pay. Better Britain. #Budget2015. Wed Mar 18 19:37:43 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy Sad that Labour think scaring the sick and vulnerable with untruths is OK. Winning isn't worth that. Wed Mar 18 19:23:29 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy Labour. Misinformation in England. Betrayal in Wales. Wed Mar 18 19:09:57 GMT 2015
Health Committee inquiry found TTIP will have no negative impact on NHS. That would be none. Zero. As in: there won't be any. Wed Mar 18 19:05:31 GMT 2015
@Laurencewinston @glasterlaw1 @Ed_Miliband @andyburnhammp @UKLabour Sadly they prefer misinformation in England to truth in Wales. Wed Mar 18 18:43:48 GMT 2015
Five years. #NHS protected. Everywhere. Except Wales. Services slashed. Patients sacrificed. By Labour. Fight back. Reject them. Wed Mar 18 18:38:56 GMT 2015
Here's a critique of the Budget we should pay attention to. Unlike Labour's call for yet more debt. https://t.co/UgUrxZ6tDc Wed Mar 18 18:27:55 GMT 2015
I hope honest Labour campaigners  will disown scaremongering about NHS. Conservatives have protected & will protect budget. #NHS Wed Mar 18 14:41:23 GMT 2015
@edmorrow87 It's more than they've ever paid before while lower paid are removed from income tax altogether. It's progress. Wed Mar 18 13:54:28 GMT 2015
Miliband so desperate he's inventing nonexistent plans to cut NHS. It's a tough job but he's not up to it. Wed Mar 18 13:52:50 GMT 2015
@toadmeister The low paid pay less tax, Toby!  But point taken :) Wed Mar 18 13:46:05 GMT 2015

Good economic news continues today - the unemployment rate in #Beverley and #Holderness has fallen to 2.1% (down from 3.8% in May 2010). Wed Mar 18 10:26:02 GMT 2015
@RachelReevesMP is right. Labour abandoned unemployed. Conservatives are proudly party of the unemployed providing jobs and hope. Tue Mar 17 18:51:36 GMT 2015
I will be on @daily_politics on BBC2 shortly to discuss the Trojan Horse allegations in Birmingham and the report from @CommonsEd. Tue Mar 17 12:05:01 GMT 2015
Labour don't like fact @grantshapps is a business success. They hate that he's a great party chairman who'll defeat them in May. Mon Mar 16 07:35:24 GMT 2015

@TeachFirst God save us from expensive, unevidenced, populist pre-election promises - whoever they come from. Thu Feb 12 11:38:38 GMT 2015
@martinwwhite72 And I think I'd trust heads more than Tristram until there was evidence otherwise. Which there isn't. Thu Feb 12 11:37:01 GMT 2015
@martinwwhite72 Agreed. The question is whether QTS is an effective or necessary measure of that. Many heads obviously don't think so. Thu Feb 12 11:34:40 GMT 2015
@martinwwhite72 It's a facile argument but you probably know that. It's also popular like smaller class sizes so who cares, right? Thu Feb 12 10:46:35 GMT 2015
@SteveBesley You shouldn't fret. If  burdening the young with more debt from more spending now is what you want, Ed's your man. Thu Feb 12 10:15:36 GMT 2015
@martinwwhite72 Ask Tristram's  mum and dad. He was educated by them. My Q is not about their popularity however but about their quality. Thu Feb 12 10:12:29 GMT 2015
@ajjolley Indeed. Thu Feb 12 10:09:06 GMT 2015
@peterbotting and he's as indifferent to truth of allegations as he is to evidence for benefits of smaller class sizes. Dangerous populism. Thu Feb 12 09:47:23 GMT 2015
Labour's education policy suffers same ailment as education system they left - lack of rigour. QTS &  class size policies both lack evidence Thu Feb 12 09:44:59 GMT 2015

@Faeriefruitcake It's too early to say for sure but academies roll out has coincided with an overall improvement in English schools. Wed Feb 04 08:55:09 GMT 2015
@TeacherROAR It's well done. Though it repeats the canard that we said there's no evidence, it goes on to say the more accurate 'too early'. Wed Feb 04 08:51:03 GMT 2015
@pdjmail1 I'm delighted to see the report being discussed. Just don't want ideologues misrepresenting it whichever side they're on. Wed Feb 04 08:46:31 GMT 2015

Contrary to @cyclingkev's claims we didn't say there was no evidence that academies lead to improvement. We said it was too early to judge. Tue Feb 03 22:38:09 GMT 2015

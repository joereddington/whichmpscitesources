@Andyphilipday Conservatives are proud of success, celebrate it & want more to enjoy it. Labour's multimillionaires  pull up the drawbridge.
@BEVERLEYBOUNCER I won't be. #NHS needs reform and serious thought not use by Labour as political football. The Efford Bill is flawed.
@adysharp86 No Russians and nobody pretending to be something they are not. Best just to be yourself.
Sneering superiority & hypocrisy of Labour's multi millionaire London elite is hard to take. Thornberry's tweet typical of how they think.

@Peter_Rock_UK Agreed. Many feel ill equipped to protect their children online so better training & support for teachers also needed.

@mar45 Labour's assumption of moral superiority means they're happy to lie for the cause. And no amount of failure in govt puts them off.
@ostercywriter It's a start in rebuilding the economy which pays the taxes to provide public services which Labour wrecked.
Under the Conservatives the rich are paying a higher share of tax than under Labour & millions of low earners now pay no income tax at all.
@edyourself Well done @HMRCgovuk.  Good news for home educating parents.
More good economic news: UK unemployment fell by 115,000 between July and September and pay excluding bonuses rose by 1.3%, above inflation.

@Sci_ents Vote how you like but please stop using climate to make partisan attacks. We need shared awareness of risk which this degrades.
@Sci_ents It seems that it is you, not they, who is guilty of prejudiced, uninformed opinion based on hunch not facts.
@Sci_ents Don't you understand the difference between the proven and the highly likely?
@ajjolley Would we had time for them all.
@SLSingh Label is misleading. Q was whether 'conclusively proven' to which only correct answer was 'No'. Good to see you earlier in week.
@A_Weatherall I agree. But fewer would feel that way if, as with this bogus poll report, probability wasn't misrepresented as certainty.
@A_Weatherall I agree which is why attacking Tories on this issue is so counter productive. Don't divide, unite and build broad support.
Caring about climate risks means building bridges & seeking consensus not careless and, in this case, specious political attacks @SLSingh
@A_Weatherall @SLSingh True but twice as many as Labour MPs who gave answer they thought politically correct but is in fact wrong. Tory win.
@A_Weatherall @SLSingh Label is wrong as Q was whether 'conclusively proven' which, of course, it isn't.
@A_Weatherall @SLSingh And they were the ones who got it wrong. Correct answer is number two, scientifically speaking.
@DCameronNews Rubbish. Most gave scientifically correct answer that it isn't 'conclusively proven' which, of course, it isn't.
@SLSingh No, they don't think it has been 'conclusively proved' which is correct and doesn't have the implication you suggest.
@Sci_ents The scientifically correct answer is answer 2 which more Tories opted for than any other party.
@Sci_ents Asked if it was 'conclusively proved' they gave the scientifically correct answer, 'No'. Spurious poll & gross misreporting.

@LearningSpy He is a singular historian and they should be his cherries, should they not?
@somsecadviser @OwenJones84 No this is the party which promised and delivered protection of NHS budget, which Labour would have cut.
@AmberJHartman @OwenJones84 I'm very sorry to hear that Amber. That's why it must be challenged to improve.
@michaellammiman Nonsense. Budget & efficiency has increased. Labour opposed increases.
@carlminns Must be Steinbeck's worst book.
@OwenJones84 Perhaps because the Tories protected NHS budget when Labour wanted to cut it. Burnham called Tory increases 'irresponsible'.

@Redpeter99 Not true. Labour's unemployment has been cut in the North and the NHS budget increased in teeth of Labour opposition.

@tonyparkin Conservatives said his new system wouldn't work under stress & it didn't.
@tonyparkin You're confusing quantity with quality. Brown dismantled system which worked & replaced it with one which failed spectacularly.

@kennygfrederick Please explain why. Not enough just to assert.
@marius_SCiP5 I'm trying to see if there is a moral or practical reason why private co.s shouldn't replace failing council child protection?
@marius_SCiP5 I don't think he did. He said there should be limits which is different.
@kennygfrederick What does that mean?
@RobertJenrick If you win I hope you'll join the APPG on Rural Services as well as the Rural Fair Share campaign.
@Gwenelope I'm not saying private sector should do it. Don't want children sacrificed on anyone's ideological altar.
@Gwenelope And that will be equally true of those who work for profit making firms as for councils.
@somsecadviser I'm not aware of examples either way.
@somsecadviser It's all about the quality of commissioning. Nothing intrinsically good or bad about state or private. Get incentives right.
@somsecadviser Agreed. Assess on merits. Interesting how things have gone at Hinchingbrooke hospital. http://t.co/63GsNUpTuZ
@somsecadviser Not from me. Are you certain private sector can never help? If so, why? If not, then let's assess on merits.
@SueChambers14 More appalled by that than systematic failure to protect children?
@oscii No contract would be constructed like that.
@oscii What do you mean?
@somsecadviser Exactly. If child protection services keep failing & council wants to bring in private sector, wd u rule it out in principle?
@janboo I wasn't assuming that. Would you assume the opposite?
@somsecadviser A longer list of council/state fails to match your list of private sector ones is what I meant. Each side has +s & -s
@ChrisChivers2 Many councils doing great job. Q is what to do about sustained failures.
@ChrisChivers2 I'm not sure either. Can be a tendency to highlight private sector failure & gloss over state frailties. Need balance.
@Gwenelope Neither are they entirely altruistic.
@somsecadviser A longer list of council failures could be produced. Doesn't answer question. Need open minds not right or left orthodoxies.
@ChrisChivers2 But why a tax incentive? Why not just pay them if they deliver a safe service & make children supported & secure?
@kennygfrederick Funding isn't central problem is it? Failing authorities aren't worst funded. About organisation, leadership, focus.
@ChrisChivers2 A tax incentive for whom?
@paulsnorman But no more than incentive to be self serving & lazy if badly managed in public sector. A failing service is a failing service.
@paulsnorman There is risk in everything. Leaving failing council services unchallenged coz 'profit is evil' is v risky for children too.
@kennygfrederick But Westminster Council is one of the more effective local authorities. :)
@paulsnorman But profit motive is powerful discipline. Q is whether can be channelled to deliver where some council services fail.
@paulsnorman Good Q. Is there framework that encourages early intervention, reduced crises & aligns child need with profit?
@somsecadviser Given the scale & severity of failure don't we owe it to children to assess on merits not kneejerk opposition?
@Gwenelope Every one who works in child protection does it for a living - for a profit if you like. Doesn't make them ideological.
@Gwenelope That's an emotive, not practical or child focused argument. So many services are failing & children suffering. Might it help?
@natkin You're not alone. Many think it more important no one should make profit than making children safe.
@somsecadviser What about the failures of so many councils? Birmingham? Is it practical Q for you or ideological? Do children come first?
@Gwenelope Why? What's immoral is putting ideology ahead of children's needs. If (big If) firms do better job should be welcomed surely?
Should private sector take over failing child protection services? Is there a reason it can't bring improvement?

@paulsnorman It might be but yours was a specific point and it was wrong.
@paulsnorman You're blustering. You alleged misrepresentation but have nothing to hang it on. Perhaps you could row back a little.
@paulsnorman Youth unemployment has reduced. Raising the school leaving age doesn't affect definitions.
@paulsnorman And who was responsible for regulating the banks? Who dismantled the previous regulatory regime? Whose watch? Labour.
@HU17 I'll find out and get back to you.

@MalcDow Its hard to get a job when long term unemployed & confidence is shot. Abandonment, not helpful work experience, is sinister option.
@LouiseBurfDons @unitetheunion Long term unemployed can feel abandoned & alone. Daily support or work experience will make real difference.
@ChristianVoteUK Refusing to provide work experience for long term unemployed because of hard left orthodoxies is cowardly & wrong.
@simonharley @unitetheunion Putting socialism ahead of the needs of the long term unemployed. Despicable.
Unemployment a price worth paying? @unitetheunion tells charities not to provide work experience for long term unemployed. Don't they care?
One and a half million more people now have a job compared to 2010. Great news but much more to be done to stop misery of joblessness.
@JoRichardsKent It was that cynicism which abandoned so many to despair & the dole under Labour. Now families are helped & it's working.
@Kitty_B_Good No, just intensive help for those who suffer the indignity & misery of long term unemployment.
New intensive Help to Work scheme will rescue more from anguish of dole. @Nhttp://ow.lwdslI #GetBritainWorking

@Hullbhoy @KarlTurnerMP I did not fiddle anything. Please don't repeat this false accusation.
@Hullbhoy @KarlTurnerMP Event is now cancelled. Refunds going out. Apology forced. Investigation imminent.
@RebeccaHerber44 @MikeSWhitehead @KarlTurnerMP Then why did he missell a Labour fundraiser, illegally use public funds & try to laugh it off
@MaltonTom @KarlTurnerMP It wasn't advertised in a straight way. It illegally used public resources. It's cancelled & will be investigated.
@migdurbeville Petty & unfair unlike criticism of a missold #dodgyfundraiser illegally organised with public funds & now cancelled
@alanmills405 Advertising neutral QT like summit when a Labour fundraiser. Using Parl staff & resources to do it. Just wrong. @KarlTurnerMP
@Chris1966 Happily. Wife (without giving name) asked workmen if they cd put any spare Tarmac in potholes in lane. End of. Your point?
@migdurbeville You mean the MP whose wife (without giving her name) asked workmen to put any spare in some potholes round the corner. Ahem.

That Easter feeling. The NUT thinking it should run the country, shouts, strikes, causes misery, achieves nothing. Every year. Sad.
Good news for #Hull. Youth unemployment down 25% in a year.  More people with a wage packet living better lives. Government plan is working.
It seems to me that it is union leaders rather than Michael Gove who always talk down education in this country. http://t.co/jn95JIkP8d
@educationgovuk One good principle is not to use split infinitives - unless you're hired as a script writer by Star Trek..
Good news today on truancy - persistent absence is down by 33% since 09/10 (and by 36% in the East Riding).  A real policy success.
@ajjolley No. Early Years is pre compulsory school age.
Welcome news that early education spending will account for 5.3% of the DfE budget this year, up from 4.1% in 2011/12 (nearly £2.9 bn).

Chancellor should be required to report regularly to Parliament on the state of Natural Capital. Zac Goldsmith MP #GLOBEnatcap
Natural Capital is about reconciling the environment with our economy. It's not a second order issue. Zac Goldsmith MP #GLOBEnatcap
Every business is dependent on a set of ecosystems.Trouble is that most don't understand this. @Cheshii CEO Kingfisher #GLOBEnatcap
Conflict in this century will primarily occur around resources rather than ideology. Laura Sandys MP #GLOBEnatcap
Just because some things must never be damaged does not mean that other things will not be damaged if you do not value them. #GLOBEnatcap
A long term plan is necessary to maintain and improve natural capital, delivering wellbeing & economic growth Prof Dieter Helm #GLOBEnatcap
@Johnbox_ecology We have to monetise for that reason but recognise the limitations of the approach. #GLOBEnatcap
Environment must be considered as part of the economy not separate from it. Prof Dieter Helm, Chair Natural Capital Committee #GLOBEnatcap
It's the alchemy of the 21st century that we try to translate everything into gold. Dr Roddy Fairley #GLOBEnatcap
Brilliant explanation of Natural Capital and issues around it http://t.co/yFJQuQ9xvR #GLOBEnatcap
You measure everything else so how can you fail to value services provided by nature? Lord Deben (John Gummer) #GLOBEnatcap
Taking nature's benefits for granted is increasingly untenable. Prof Paul Ekins #GLOBEnatcap
Great set of speakers at today's @globe_intl Natural Capital legislation conference I'm chairing. How do we value nature's benefits?
@MagsNews I'm calling for a smarter use of resources. Consistent, as you are in unthinking tribalism.
@greglovelluk That's 30,000 homes made available in just the first year and £1 million a day saved by taxpayer. Right morally & financially.
@MagsNews Ignoring plight of the overcrowded and homeless shows how cynical & unfit for government the Labour Party has become.
@Chris1966 The profligacy and mismanagement of the Labour Party brought us here. We are slowly restoring country's strength.
@afneil Will Labour's price freeze help unlock the investment or make blackouts more likely?
@MagsNews and return to subsidising empty rooms for people who don't need them while leaving others overcrowded or homeless. #SameOldLabour

@HullsEnterprise Do you cover the East Riding as well as Hull?
@HullsEnterprise I hold job fairs to provide practical help & get unemployment down . Not party political rallies.
@HullsEnterprise Exactly why you should have nothing to do with a one sided talk fest designed to garner votes not jobs. #SameOldLabour
@BBCPaulMurphy It's not their event. It's a Labour campaign event masquerading as a regional economic summit. #SameOldLabour
@HullsEnterprise Just suggest avoiding something so one sided & party political. It's not an innocent bid to help. #SameOldLabour
@HullsEnterprise Good. That is worth promoting.
@HullsEnterprise Unfortunately it is all about politics. Look at the speaker list. Look at the timing. Don't be fooled.
@HullsEnterprise Why not invite a range of voices to the summit? Because it's electioneering not economics. They care about votes not jobs.
@HullsEnterprise Labour's vision - one party monopoly in Hull coupled with sustained economic failure. #SameOldLabour
@andrew_allison In what way is the council corrupt? If you have evidence report it. If you don't then...
@CllrAlanClark Good councils, like East Riding, help people move and give space and hope to families. Policy makes housing go further.
Rent arrears are broadly stable and went down in the last quarter of last year. Ending subsidy of unneeded rooms is fair & working.
Ending the subsidy of empty rooms has allowed 30,000 more families to enjoy a decent home - in the first year alone.

In places like Holderness we need to see action - such as proper dredging - rather than abandonment #pmqs
At #pmqs today I asked the PM to condemn the false choice being offered by the Environment Agency between protecting urban and rural areas.
To protect UK jobs from EU regs and give youngsters a chance then it's essential we elect Conservative MEPs. Only Tories fight 4 jobs.
BBC line on Labour's leaked vote rigging report is to quote anonymous Unite person saying it's wrong. Bizarre. http://t.co/6zZl34HMGH

@jreynoldsMP @marycreagh_mp All equal except 2.9 million votes go to union members for £3 and a ticked box each. Strange equality.
@PickardJE At which point we'll see some referendums. The point is that tax rises used to be the easy choice. Now they are a last resort.
@PickardJE Is it the cost which puts them off? Or what they think the result will be?
@PickardJE Keep asking yourself that and understanding will dawn.
@KBedson and more quietly muttering it at our own side
@KBedson Parliament offers similar agony for the same reason.
@PickardJE but great news for hard pressed tax payers who have saved 100s of pounds because council tax has been brought under control.
@TreeTopsCP Guilty as charged
@GeorgeMcManus4 Sir Fred Goodwin et al were Labour bankers if I recall. They didn't create structural deficit however, Brown & Balls did.
@Sci_ents The point is that manufacturing increases correlate with Conservative Govt and decline with Labour. Happy?
Thatcher & Major grew UK manufacturing. Blair & Brown presided over manufacturing decline. #sameoldlabour http://t.co/hDat8qAvAR”
@GeorgeMcManus4 Labour's approach was unsustainable. In the end, as always with Labour, more people were dumped on the dole. #sameoldlabour
@DebStevo90 You'll get more by keeping the rate down. As JFK said restrictive tax rates will never balance the budget or produce jobs.
You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. William JH Boetcker
@GeorgeMcManus4 Labour policies will reduce government income, increase dole queues and hurt the poorest. Happens every time. #sameoldlabour
@GeorgeMcManus4 I believe in lower taxes for everyone. That's why we've lifted the tax threshold taking the low paid out of tax altogether.
Balls is a true socialist. Energy price freeze so lights go out. Tax rises so lower investment. Poverty so more Labour voters. Success!
@GeorgeMcManus4 Full HMRC link here: http://t.co/rKTATJ6iVr
@GeorgeMcManus4 My whole point is that if you push the rate up to 50% you actually REDUCE tax revenues.  See HMRC: 
http://t.co/P7tOOdk8ne
The top 1% will earn 13.7% of all income this year but pay a record 29.8% of all income tax - but Balls wants more:

@juliangbell And end up taking less money and so damage public services. But who cares if it's good politics, right?
@waynesmith1971 The truth will out. Higher rates lower the take and hurt the poorest. Labour don't care so long as it's popular.
@GdnPolitics And get less money as a result. And put the deficit up. Again.
Putting back the 50p rate will lower receipts & reduce funds for public services. Labour have learned nothing. #sameoldlabour
@spellar You left the largest annual overspend in the developed world and have opposed every effort to bring it under control. More Balls.
@politicshome If only he had any sense of shame.
@spellar Balls made the same promise 20 years ago through mouth of Gordon Brown. How did that work out?

@CareersDefender Being worked on. Govt seems confident it can come up with good data in due course. Not there yet.
Delighted by shake-up for secondary school league tables, following my campaign with @CentreForum.  BBC report here: http://t.co/tjL66YZLUC
@DrDav You're quite right. Announcement will be made this afternoon. Regrettable that spinners can't be restrained.
Refreshing that Gove advisor Dom Cummings "scorns the idea that because a few outfits are brilliant, all can be." Need to read his essay.
New secondary league table changes will be hugely positive, encouraging stretch at top and more support at bottom. Well done Michael Gove.
Sir Nick Harvey has given a very powerful speech calling for a Rural Fair Share. Lowest incomes are in rural areas yet support is least.
He jacked up energy bills when in office, now Miliband is forcing them up again with his price freeze pledge. #LabourPriceHike
Visiting @newhamcollege this morning in East Ham shadowing classes. Always good to see #FE in action.
David Laws says in debate on school governors that Govt will work closely with CBI and others to promote more business volunteers

@Samfr Congratulations and good luck. It'll be interesting to see how practical & consensual are the recommendations.

@ColinGoffin @RobAnthony01 @alimarjam10 @Just_Maths You are entirely free to do the right thing for pupils. League table impact only.

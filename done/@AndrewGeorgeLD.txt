Less than the amount the Govt claims it is saving through the #bedroomtax - ie <£350m. PM's "1bn+" is gross exaggeration.

@SocialistAgenda 
Wrong. I didn't.
But I did oppose last #Labour Govt rolling out the red carpet for private sector entry into #nhs
Today's £51 extra for every Cornish school child is welcome 1st step in putting right 30+ yrs legacy of unfair funding. But just a 1st step.
So, the Tories are upset that the my Lib D colls & I are getting credit for fair tax for poorest. But it was in our Manifesto, not theirs!

Great, we've drawn Tories into a drive-up min. wage bidding war...

Health Min tells me: having min. staff level doesn't guarantee safe care. 
So, will he end mandatory min. staffing on paediatric & IT wards?
Health Min. says safe minimum nurse no's on wards is just "box ticking".
So, he'll end hourly ward rounds & other "box ticking" exercises?!

Is safe patient care a "perverse consequence"?

@LibDems delivering #strongereconomy : aided by stomaching Coalition with "mortal enemies" (Tories) to provide essential political stability
Of course Coalition with "mortal enemy" isn't bed of roses. But stability = #strongereconomy. We must fight 4 the underdog. Tories won't.

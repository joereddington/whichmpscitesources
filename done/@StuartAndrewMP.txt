@SandgateRAG that was the point of view I tried to make. You're spot on
@Colzoss they are building there too
communities already struggling to cope with overdevelopment. Outrageous 2/2
So Labour Leeds have just voted to build 70,000 houses across the city. This will seriously jeopardise our Greenbelt and....1/2
Have consistently argued against this figure. It's too high, is not achievable and will harm the Greenbelt   2/2
At the Civic Hall to listen to the council debate the core strategy and the 70000 housing target......1/2
@BIPCLeeds Great

Great contributions at Kirkless Knoll appeal hearing from local Councillors Andrew Carter & Rod Wood and local residents #savekirkleesknoll
Housebuilders are building 4/5 bedroomed houses when we need more affordable starter homes and loads of brownfield sites available
Pointed out that housebuilders want to cherry pick green sites and say brownfield not viable. But that's against THEIR model not real needs
Highlighted that housebuilders at plan hearing attended in force when trying to boost housing target.Not one showed when transport discussed
Pointed out that LCC are well advanced with their local plan for the next 16 years. To allow approval at appeal would send the wrong message
Raised impact of indiscriminate development on local roads,schools & health services.This scheme would make things worse #savekirkleesknoll
planning process and how to grant the building of 450 houses on appeal would be wrong and send a terrible message to those people. 2/2
At the reopened inquiry on the appeal for Kirklees Knoll in Farsley. Have just spoken about the enormous work of local residents in the 1/2

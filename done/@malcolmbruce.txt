SNP would rather Scotland leave the UK and  stay in the EU - a ridiculous and dangerous position. Tue Apr 07 22:09:52 BST 2015
How dare the SNP say that only they speak for Scotland. They don't. We need a strong Scotland in a successful UK. SNP never will support it. Tue Apr 07 21:53:43 BST 2015
Tough decisions, Nicola? Arming police and stopping and searching children. Tue Apr 07 21:44:31 BST 2015
SNP promised to abolish student debt and then said it was never affordable after they won. Broken promises. Tue Apr 07 21:41:13 BST 2015

Remember the SNP were elected on a minority vote in a 50,5% turnout. They do not speak for Scotland just another (albeit large) minority. Tue Apr 07 21:29:35 BST 2015
Labour will deliver no food banks, no zero hours contracts and no austerity at no cost. If you believe that get ready to be let down. Tue Apr 07 21:23:44 BST 2015
Does STV audience really believe  Nicola can deliver more spending at no cost? Tue Apr 07 21:20:52 BST 2015
Borrowing more before deficit eliminated puts recovery at risk. That's what the SNP want. Tue Apr 07 21:04:58 BST 2015

Why do you think Tories are bigging up Sturgeon and SNP? Obvious really. Need each other. Thu Apr 02 22:31:25 BST 2015
Sturgeon assertive  but she relied on other leaders not knowing the facts as to how SNP failed to deliver on NHS, education & police etc. Thu Apr 02 22:12:53 BST 2015
SNP will abandon balancing the books, put recovery at risk and set Scotland against the UK when we should build fair recovery for whole UK. Thu Apr 02 21:59:21 BST 2015
Nicola. How dare you? You have cut college places and university research while Lib Dems have increased them in England. Thu Apr 02 21:40:57 BST 2015

Coalition increased NHS spending in England. Scotland and Wales cut it. Lib Dems set mental health targets and will deliver the £8bn needed Thu Apr 02 20:54:33 BST 2015
SNP didn't protect NHS budget, Nicola. People in Aberdeen/shire know that only too well. Thu Apr 02 20:50:25 BST 2015

Govt still not doing enough on business rates. @UKLabour plan to cut and then freeze rates would help 1.5m businesses.
@UKLabour led the way on business rates, govt partial u-turn today, so why did they vote against action in debate yesterday?
What Osborne didn't admit today... real wages will have fallen by 5.8% by 2015 - you're worse off under the Tories #costofcameron
.@edballsmp points out that living standards for most people under this Chancellor and PM are not rising - they're falling year on year.
A cap on business rates will fall far short; firms will still face rising bills, govt must cut + freeze business rates for small businesses.

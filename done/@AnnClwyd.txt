Thanks to all my colleagues for voting me Health Campaigner of the Year #DodsAwards & thanks to the 3000+ people who wrote to me
Attended #ProtestSong by @TimJPrice @NationalTheatre. Standing ovation for Rhys Ifans. Powerful message for politicians about homelessness
Honoured to be among the nominees for #Dodsawards Health Campaigner of the Year for leading the report into NHS Hospitals Complaints System
Another example of hospital boards not listening about concerns&not acting to stop bad practice -> http://t.co/I5pvIbIXAO +++
+++ Our recent report on "hospital complaints" is relevant here again -> https://t.co/tjrmScX6xa
It was the weakness of the English equivalent, the Care Quality Commission, which allowed the scandal of Mid Staffs to go on for so long
The RCS is right to be concerned at the weakness of Health Inspectorate Wales
The Royal College of Surgeons have also joined me in calling for a review of the Welsh NHS, amid 'public anxiety' about standards of care
I stand full square with the comments of the Welsh Public Services Ombudsman, there is far too little external scrutiny of the Welsh NHS
Saw 6 dead badgers on the road to Oxford, Sunday.  Were they trying to escape the bullets?
Thanks St.Thomas's.  My thumb-squashed by myself in Car door got great treatment in A&E by fantastic Nurse.  I'll come again !!
Bradley Manning is innocent OK #bradleymanning
Shock figures - 11 out of 17 hospitals in Wales have higher death rates than 'average'. UHW top of the list. Why? http://t.co/mkvBZ6hmYz

Free Bradley Manning! The only right verdict. #FreeBrad
More and more small private care companies eaten up by predators =  Pressure put on carers to cut corners. Old and sick clients suffer!

Why are workmen in white overalls + breathing apparatus on the Parliamentary estate? If asbestos is being removed we need to know!
Cynon Valley Constituency says Hooray!!!!!!
Out on the picket line with the brave workers at the Remploy factory in Aberdare today #saveremploy
The brave workers at the #Remploy factory in Aberdare and across Wales and the UK who are out on strike today have my full support.
I am calling for greater regulation of #cosmeticsurgery in my Ten Minute Rule Bill this afternoon. Will the Governemnt take action?
High-handed attempt by the Govt to foist new electoral arrangements on the Welsh Assembly - without proper debate or public consultation!
Met Aung San Suu Kyi today after years of campaigning for her. She thanked me + all human rights activists+ spoke of her hope for democracy
Once again, no answer when Govt is asked where the jobs are for #Remploy workers about to be thrown on the scrapheap. Appalling!
The carve-up of parliamentary constitunecies in Wales - What does the public think? We will find out tomorrow. #boundarycommissionforwales
Time is up for Assad's regime. Safe Havens in Syria are a must at the very least.
Anyone had bad experiences after plastic surgery? I will be calling for better regulation in Parliament. Pls write to clwyda@parliament.uk
Voted last night against extending #SundayTradingHours during Olympics. For many shop workers, reduced Sunday hours mean only family time.

UK now officially in a double dip #recession. Clearly a result of the Government's failed economic policies!
Can #BradleyManning get a fair trial in the US? No. His lawyers are denied key information whether Manning did any harm to US interests.
Estimated 100k women mutilated in UK. Still no prosecutions despite #FGM law I helped bring in. Govt must take action! http://t.co/s6FFvxbh

Excellent news! Welsh Govt decides to drop plans for badger cull http://t.co/VIiqg31g
Cameron tells me in PMQs that he'll look at devolving the Remploy factory budget in Wales to Labour Welsh Govt. The factories are viable!
Sparkling peformance from Ed Miliband today in response to the govt budget. An unfair budget from the same old Tories!
The govt were too afraid to make a statement in public about their grubby decision to close #Remploy factories and sack 1332 disabled people
No government statement on the future of Remploy today, but a decision is expected in the near future.
The fate of Remploy may be known tomorrow. We are not optimistic.
All eyes on Tunis for the Syria conference. The international community must move to halt the slaughtering! #Syria #Homs
Knock out performance from Ed Miliband on the #NHS in #PMQs yesterday. Carry on like this and the coalition will be flat on its back!
What is the government hiding? It should release the Department for Health risk impact assemsent for the #NHS shake-up now.
UK government must press #Bahrain for genuine democratic reform!
#Unemployment up again. This government is failing a generation of young people. The social scars of mass unemployment will last for decades
Call from Syrian activists for international medical aid. The UN must act! #Syria #Homs
Cameron talking rubbish again in PMQs - the Tory led UK Govt cuts the block grant to Wales, then blames the Welsh Govt for NHS cuts!
Mrs Assad is living in cloud cuckoo land! She should take a trip to #Homs to see what is really going on. #Syria
Just been to a reception on #FemaleGenitalMutilation. Need for some prosecutions in the UK.
Threat of terrible massacre at #Homs. Regional powers and UN Secretary General must take action on #Syria now.
Tories talk about welfare to work - that means jobs - what jobs? #WelfareReformBill set to clobber the poor, the old, and the disabled!!
#WelfareReformBill Same old Tories!
#Hester at #RBS has decided not to take his bonus. What about the other executives? And the other banks? We need regulation of top pay!
#Governmentcuts 158 officers from S. Wales #police. Police in UK face 'perfect strom'. MPs of all parties should vote against on Feb 8!
We need a proper register of lobbyists now http://t.co/bsFphEvW When will the PM take some action?!!!

My thoughts are with the staff at #Peacocks http://t.co/qpaoS6kG Grossly unjust when RBS chiefs continue to rake it in http://t.co/ITIopiGT
Very interesting article about RBS and Peacocks! http://t.co/eGOMzL5c
Further evidence of the misery this government's economic policies are causing http://t.co/Fs8mG5Tz
Along with other Welsh Labour MPs I have called on Vince Cable to take action to help save #Peacocks http://t.co/XUYyxEYX
The government has a duty to intervene in order to save jobs at #Peacocks
Shame on RBS - which is part nationalised! Losing #Peacocks would be a big loss for South Wales http://t.co/j2oKnR6i

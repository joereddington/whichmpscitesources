With Cllr Emmett calling on Rutlanders to choose Option 3 of Urgent Care consultation to extend service in the county http://t.co/k0cPWAcF3o
Been visiting Rutland County College. With star pupil Tom Radley, just got into Cambridge. The first of many to come! http://t.co/OZXB44ys04
I first met Tony Benn at a Vote No to Europe referendum rally in 1975. At that time I agreed with him- for once! An electrifying speaker.
Good to be in the chamber earlier today to hear royal assent given to @BillCashMP’s International Development (Gender Equality) Act 2014
It’s been a while, but I’m pleased to say I’m back on Twitter. Looking forward to sharing my news and views with you here.
3 days & over 20 target seats in the Midlands. Support feels solid and good. Onwards!
@EdzJohnson thank you! Keep helping us to win!
@mrcivlib We have changed the website for the election. It's minimal. You can still buy the book!
Blitzing the Midlands visiting marginals, including Corby, Worcester and Dudley South. No Lib Dem surge we can detect.
@M4ryLamont Sorry for not replying, have been doing lots of marginal seats this weekend. Am doing a tour of east Rutland next week!
@wayneodell not the Speaker! But often mistaken for him. So out of order!
DC looked like next PM. Blog wars breaking out now, but it is what you think yourself that matters. Have confidence! Go for it ...
Some people think they're clever, defacing and ripping down posters. They've done over lots of mine during the night. Poor, sad people.
Good morning in Melton and the cattle market. Supportive response. Manifesto launch looking good.
Whatever next... Harriet Harman now tells me she wants a law to make all football teams half-male, half-female! Bad maths for starters!
What charming staff I have. A birthday cake with an icing photo of Lady T and me on the top. Can't bear to cut through her!
looks like Govt rigging its tax revenue to boost the next figures, squeezing companies on VAT/PAYE and encouraging early payment of both
at the Sun Inn in Rutland promoting Kennel Clubs 'Open for Dogs' campaign which is good for the pub trade
Just spoke to Dominic Grieve. He says he's off to Broadmoor. We all feel like that some times.
Suffering slow speed rail today. Train from Hull has stuck brakes - off to pub till the next one comes!
Just visited Hull Prison, just like Porridge but fab Governor and team. One inmate wants to rejoin the army, really hope he does.
Just spoken to 1000 6th formers in London. I said 'those who can, must use their vote.' Lively Q&A afterwards-lots of great questions asked
At a firm in Leicester which makes trackers for convicted offenders. They want to GPS tag and map me for a week... should I agree?
At Feltham Young Offenders Institute. Holds youngsters 15-18 and 18-24. Sort out this lot and we'd solve a bundle of problems later.
Visited St Giles Trust. Fab rehab work for young gang members in London.  Beat this for a quote: "Nothing stops a bullet like a job."
Just visited Peterborough prison, this one is privately built and run. Too many Londoners in it too far from home.
Busy day in Rutland. Highways department been brilliant in removing another 30 useless road signs.
@iaindale Thank you for your welcome. I gather you are to come to Rutland to chair an FSB panel. Queues forming already!
Nick Herbert has just opened a ginormous Anglian Water treatment plant here in my patch.  Without Rutland Water millions would be thirsty!
Anne Treneman of the Times and the BBC have just phoned - both highly amused by Harriet's deep Twitter mystery...
I did get a message in Harriet's name, so I sent a friendly message back by text. A bit confusing, and all in my first week on Twitter.
Apparently Harriet Harman has caused a stir in the Commons by saying someone has been tweeting in her name and suddenly I replied to her!
The Today Programme's Thought For The Day was very good on the rehabilitation of prisoners. Almost entirely the same as our Party policy!
Justice demands that elderly Eq Life policy holders who have lost out need immediate interim compensation. Their treatment so far is unfair.
Have just been to the All Party Group on Equitable Life. Absolutely packed meeting to quiz Sir John Chadwick and the Minister, Liam Byrne.
Have just visited Holloway Prison. It’s for women only. Distressing to see newborn babies there with their mothers.
Voila! Straw is trying to look tough on crime while trying to make it tough for us after the election. So he thinks we're going to win...
@thehowardleague yes, an am doing my best to encourage that grown up debate
Looks like Straw will scrap Early Release. We knew this was coming - it's our policy, but only when we have enough prison places.

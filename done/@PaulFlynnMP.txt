Tory MP's delusional optimism on Helmand tragedy. Gains are  fragile: losses catastrophic. As always politicians lie and soldiers die.

NATO Newport summit going wonderfully well socially happy visits to schools from Obama and Select Committees. Newport  learning to love NATO
Oh dear! Radio Wales reports Mount Pleasant School is 'just outside Newport'. It's IN Newport. Give 'em a map someone.
@FannyIngabout It's a ridiculous neurotic game of secrecy where the truth leaks in all directions. Still, wonderful for children and Newport
Obama will be impressed by  Mount Pleasant School - a credit to Welsh education like all our schools. Private education futile here.
Just officially informed by 10 Downing Street that Obama and Dave will visit a school in my constituency. Details already in the Argus.

Outrageous plan at Newport NATO summit to give NATO right to initiate wars without approval from individual countries. Must be rejected.
NATO conference must not be abused to increase arms bills. Spending above our weight militarily means dying beyond our responsibilities.
There are more Tory MPs in Newport now than there are at Westminster. Using Summit as a political platform? Snub to mayor is insulting
@ArgusKevinWard This is a unwarranted discourtesy to the Mayor and the City. Who decides this? Welsh Office ministers?
Independence of 3 Baltic States won with intelligence, courage and restraint - could have been 3 Ulsters ior 3 Vietnams. NATO must help now

@LM_Marlow The police gave the BBC a photograph of Cliff Richard's house to strengthen the story. Police back before Committee next week

@teachertwit2 US/UK interventions in Iraq & Helmand = disasters. Resisting Syria attack was correct. Difference in Bush and Obama's NATOs
There's a liberated alternative to the alternative NATO conference going on Twitter now where no views are banned.
@DeansOfCardiff No the Russians soldiers are on their holidays. Pro Putin Kagarlitsky replaced me as a speaker because I believe otherwise.
@teachertwit2 Explain that to Estonians after Putin Cyber attack, then tell the Latvians and Lithuanians who threatens their independence.
@teachertwit2 In present European crisis saying no to Obama's NATO means saying yes to Putin. Alternative conference gagged this comment.

@meadwaj Did he explain how President Bush blew up the twin towers on September 11th?
NO TO NATO main speaker is Boris Kagarlitsky, 9/11 'Truther' and a Putin groupie. Blundering campaign. NO TO NATO means YES TO PUTIN.
Pippa creates fiction that police threatened a pub. Pub say no. She said anti-NATO meeting was a family day. It was not. Long march flopped.

Parliament's scientific rigour will not be enriched by a chair of Health Committee who believes blood clotting is determined by the moon.
t's the Tory way. Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May blundered so they sacked  their SPADS. It's the Big Buck Passing Society
14/10/09: David Tredinnick Tory MP said. ‘At certain phases of the moon, Surgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective'.
One Tory MP seeking Chair of Health Committee said surgeons work at odd times because blood does not clot when there is a full moon.
May and Gove both humiliated by self-lacerating mutual treachery. Any precedent for civil servant ordered to sort out internal party row?

@PhilipUKIP @JohnRentoul @MrJacHart I did not believe the 'lies' I was one of 139 Labour MPs who voted against UK backing Bush's Iraq war.
@JohnRentoul 50 Labour MPs who had previously opposed the war were bullied, bamboozled or bribed into voting for war or abstaining by whips
@MrMirth The Tories were cheerleaders for joining Bush's Iraq War in greater numbers than other parties. 139 Labour MPs voted against.

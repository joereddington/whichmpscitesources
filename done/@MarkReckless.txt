@GreavsieE definition of induce: 'lead' or 'cause' display and seems @stellacreasy also asked you to put possibly identifying mark on ballot Thu Apr 23 12:52:18 BST 2015
@simonxthomas @Arathrael @DPJHodges @stellacreasy look up a definition of induce Thu Apr 23 12:13:13 BST 2015
@Arathrael @IainDale @DPJHodges @stellacreasy @RichardLoweUK It may be inducing/causing/leading further display and this may now be tested Thu Apr 23 11:58:19 BST 2015
@jimwaterson @RossMcCaff @stellacreasy @IainDale @DPJHodges ... that is the voter publicising, not others inducing/causing further display Thu Apr 23 11:56:35 BST 2015
@GreavsieE17 @frank_fisher @stellacreasy I am not sure that is relevant to the offence Thu Apr 23 11:55:06 BST 2015
@stellacreasy ... that may soon be for others to judge @IainDale @DPJHodges Thu Apr 23 11:53:53 BST 2015
@Arathrael @IainDale @DPJHodges @stellacreasy @RichardLoweUK read 3.89 of their report and you will see induce to display is PV offence too Thu Apr 23 11:52:23 BST 2015
@anthonyjwells @DPJHodges @stellacreasy No, 3.89 "It is an offence to induce someone to show how hey have voted" applies to postal votes too Thu Apr 23 11:50:02 BST 2015
@WelshGasDoc @stellacreasy @IainDale Of course, and the secret ballot is a hard fought democratic principle we look to them to uphold Thu Apr 23 11:44:14 BST 2015
@stellacreasy We look forward to your visit but you can still tweet and if RT is not deleted by noon I intend to report to police @IainDale Thu Apr 23 11:38:43 BST 2015

@GreavsieE17 @stellacreasy definition of induce includes to lead or cause to display Thu Apr 23 11:28:23 BST 2015
@stellacreasy http://t.co/boxCqNEPXL  If you don't now delete your RT I will refer to police as at least arguably a breach of election law Thu Apr 23 11:24:53 BST 2015
@GreavsieE17 It was @stellacreasy and not you that did the RT of your ballot to 50k+ people Thu Apr 23 11:15:06 BST 2015

@MartynWilliams2 @stellacreasy @GreavsieE17 @labourwhips Yes, having first tried the Electoral Commission who advise contacting the police Thu Apr 23 11:04:02 BST 2015
@stellacreasy @GreavsieE17 @labourwhips On my reading alleged breach would be yours and not his: suggest you stop digging and delete your RT Thu Apr 23 10:50:15 BST 2015
@GreavsieE17 Quite.I am concerned that @stellacreasy may have induced you to display your ballot very widely by her RT poss breach s66(3)(d) Thu Apr 23 10:47:22 BST 2015

@Trevelloz The Medway Towns are bigger urban centre. I also think there's been a recent upsurge in visible homeless on Rochester High Street Tue Feb 10 20:09:10 GMT 2015
@Trevelloz I just looked at your manifesto you linked to. In what way do you say more of an issue in Medway than Gravesham? Tue Feb 10 20:03:59 GMT 2015
@Jag_197 No. I did support the cuts so far, and I don't retreat from that, but I don't think police can or should bear cuts like that again Tue Feb 10 17:37:55 GMT 2015
@Jag_197 I did. When a member of Kent Police Authority I abstained on police budget in 2008, explaining why, then voted against it in 2009 Tue Feb 10 17:09:11 GMT 2015
@Jag_197 There was quite a lot of fat to be cut back then, at least relative to the private sector, but no more Tue Feb 10 16:57:21 GMT 2015
I backed Kent police cuts from 2009 but cuts have now gone so far public safety and neighbourhood policing at risk, so UKIP voted No to more Tue Feb 10 15:44:03 GMT 2015
Tories once promised to protect front line but Con police minister just said only "tiny"amount of policing visible and doesn't want to raise Tue Feb 10 14:05:27 GMT 2015

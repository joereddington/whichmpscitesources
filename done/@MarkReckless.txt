@PaulOnPolitics I am from Eltham originally and moved to Upnor then Rochester 14 years ago.Does PM agree w attack on me for going to Oxford?
@GlennMoore1974 @george_perfect1 @cgi247 I think they have again misjudged the people of Rochester and Strood, e.g. 'grew up in London'
@george_perfect1 @cgi247 Do you think @David_Cameron has signed off this attack on me for going to Oxford?
@charlie_21 I know. You are probably incorrectly recorded on the electoral roll as 'Mr'
@portmedway I would be happy to do so
@charlie_21 Apologies, although I would say that the incorrect 'Mr' has most likely come through from Medway Council's electoral roll
@DanDicko81 I think Bill but I need to confirm that by consulting people openly and fairly, unlike the prior Council process. Good night
@DanDicko81 Assurance is that if re-elected I will as MP run new fair+open consultation. If people as opposed as Bill says I will fight it.
@DanDicko81 I have looked at this much more closely and critically since my switch and I don't now think council plans add up
@DanDicko81 I went to his house and spent a an hour or two with him recently for a good briefing - impressive guy
“@oidptg: @MarkReckless turned 18 last month, can't wait to cast my first ever vote next Thursday for you Mark!!! Can I get a RT?” >You can!
@stroodsue @38_degrees @PaulOnPolitics I am sorry I have given apologies for this one
“@RonProwse: @MarkReckless first time I have heard you speak wishing you all the best for next week what you did took ba!!s” > Thank you
@DanDicko81 I think Council behaved badly but I don't want to criticise the ward Councillors. I will ask public re options, eg new hospital

@andrewmackness Not at all, many enjoy guarantee of a seat and greater sense of community amongst those who travel
@John_Perry_UK Thank you
In Strood South ward large numbers commute to London but most do so by coach rather than train as can't or hard to afford £4k+ season ticket
If Tory MP who called Strood 'Benefits Street' had canvassed, not just leafletted, they would know that most Strood residents go out to work
@GregHands @DouglasCarswell I enjoy elections, even the nuisance phone calls. Messina won't save you
@PaulGoodmanCH Hence the 'up to' and @UKIP will publish costed manifesto at appropriate time. For now, I have Rochester+Strood calls to make
@PaulGoodmanCH @UKIP I haven't proposed how we would use the up to £25bn, just observed that we might have that when other parties would not
@PaulGoodmanCH I would like us to reduce borrowing first, including savings from EU contribution and overseas aid, as @UKIP proposes
@PaulGoodmanCH @UKIP I would like a sovereign wealth fund as much as anyone but can't see how we credibly start one when borrowing £100bn pa
@GregHands @GuidoFawkes @DouglasCarswell ... being trolled by Conservatives' Deputy Chief Whip
@PaulGoodmanCH @ConHome ... we would have freed up to £25bn pa from EU contributions and overseas aid
@UKIPBH @GawainTowler @DouglasCarswell Thank you
@GregHands ... like the Chancellor?
@PaulGoodmanCH @ConHome ... but we are borrowing £100bn a year!?

@GuidoFawkes @IsabelHardman ...so I am being attacked for tone of what I said. Will they approve it? What did Planning Minister tell Medway?
@p_r_anderson @GuidoFawkes No, it was not an SSSI when I spoke in Parliament. It was only later confirmed as such.
@IsabelHardman @GuidoFawkes Why don't you ask Tories if will approve Lodge Hill but delay until after election as Cons cllrs say were told?
@IsabelHardman @GuidoFawkes I do not say I support Lodge Hill in speech (made b4 SSSI) I say "council is concerned" and quote council leader
@GuidoFawkes I oppose it as now SSSI and would join our villages into conurbation, although I am keen to see much housing regen along Medway
Tories should answer key Q on Lodge Hill, will they allow it? Seems local Cons cllrs told govt would green light but not announce b4election
@GuidoFawkes ... and they misleadingly edit out those parts of my Commons speech where I state I was putting Medway Council's view
@dats ... and they misleadingly edit out the parts of my Commons speech where I state I was putting Medway Council's view
So EU surcharge is same as before but @George_Osborne claims it is halved and they want us to believe they'd hold a fair In/Out Referendum!?

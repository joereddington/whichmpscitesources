Tory MPs talking about fairness re Scotland v England but happy to support redistribution of funds from poorer regions to Tory heartlands.
@StuDunn1966 I agree English Parliament argument would be bad news for NE without real devolution of resources & decision making.
@foy_paul @UKLabour agree but Looks like Cameron determined to in trench present inequality in power & funding.
@MichaelJandC  agree
Cameron true to form no mention in his statement on devolution of powers to Regions.
Tory MPs call 4 English MPs only to vote on English laws will not help the North East & Regions, simply more resources 4 Tory heartlands
Coalition Govt spent last 4 years with anti regional policy deliberately redistributing funds from NE & poorest region to wealthier South.
Cameron to speak 1 simple act to benefit North East put back 'need' in formula for  Local Govt/health funding taken away by Coalition Govt.

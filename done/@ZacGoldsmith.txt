. @DouglasCarswell The main Parties have no idea. They refuse to share power with voters and so eventually they will lose it.

@GeorgeMonbiot World's poorest are hardest hit when ecosystems are ravaged. DFID's huge budget shd be explicitly focused on repair & renewal
@GeorgeMonbiot I support this Proposal and will try to gather support from others. But we need much more. Eg DFID's huge budget … 1/2
Greens seem to be replacing LibDems as the anti-establishment party on the left. 4x more votes than the LDs in Rochester.

Jack Petchey awards tonight in Richmond... What a hero he is. And big congrats to all the winners.
Massive congrats PCSO Guinnie Mooneesawmy for winning Int'l Assn of Women Police Community Service Award. Our community is lucky to have you
@nickcarthew I don't agree with the report. But if there's any truth in it, I will not let that happen, obviously.
@nickcarthew If we are going to win this campaign, it requires action across all parties.
@MikkiL @dunstablian @scotmonk Love to see the quote where I said I'd resign over this. Thank you.
@nickcarthew Are the LDs going to win the election? No. Could they form a Coalition? Yes. Is opposition to R3 a red line? No. Work it out
@nickcarthew Of course I am asking him to rule out R3 (as you know) but I am also asking LDs to help, instead of playing juvenile games.

@Ms_Anthropy @JolyonRubs the day Jolyon 'bows and scrapes' is probably the day to pack it all in...
@Ms_Anthropy @JolyonRubs I don't know her record, but agree there are massive probs with politics. Need to focus on meaningful reforms.
@Ms_Anthropy @JolyonRubs If I'm not speaking in a debate, and if like this one there's no vote - I often do my thing & read transcript after
@Ms_Anthropy @JolyonRubs If I had to sit through all debates, I'd not be able to do any of my campaigns- Recall/green/farming/heathrow etc
@Ms_Anthropy @JolyonRubs Which bit?! It's a fact. If MPs sat in chamber through all debates, they'd not be able to do anything else.
@JolyonRubs Agreed. But MPs don't usually stay for whole debate, even key ones. They come and go. Always full for 1st & last bit.
@climate_rev I don't know. Was before I was an MP, and am not part of the pension.
@LeoHickman @JolyonRubs I'm not aware of a debate on Pay since I've been around, but I may be wrong. Either way, that pic isn't it!

@DGWilkinson Yes.
@rbp77 I haven't seen them - other than speeches in the debate (some excruciating).
...Sanders adds; “I could have faced a recall campaign for having voted to close corporation tax loopholes”. Such confidence in voters! 3/3
LibDems writing to constituents with amazing excuses for opposing real recall - all designed to make cowardly decision appear noble. 1/3
@networkrail Thanks. Have emailed you.
@AndrewTurvey See my tweets to her yesterday. Inaccurate, and not only 'in parts'!
@networkrail is anyone actually operating the barriers at Vine road?
@tessamunt … as you yourself have acknowledged! The article is disingenuous, and genuinely disappointing.
@tessamunt and most of all Carline Lucas. Had she been convicted - she'd have faced automatic Recall under the perverse LibDem Bill.
@tessamunt EG Court costs (courts play no role), funding (costs are more tightly controlled at all stages than in normal elections) and..
@tessamunt Well I agree, obviously. But my point is that you have misrepresented my amendments in order to justify voting against them.
@MarinaKim_ haha! Thank you. And I like the brackets. Nice touch.
@RMcGeddon @tessamunt prime!
@tessamunt unlike the LD version which wd make Recall inevitable for peaceful protest, while protecting the likes of D Laws 2/2
@tessamunt The Caroline Lucas point is particularly silly. She's a key backer of real recall & knows it would protect good MPs like her..1/2

@jackieschneider I am no expert and it's not for me to decide, but I have put his name forward.

@stacyherbert @Ian_Fraser excellent
@peparkin @steve_mccabe Likewise, but MPs voted against the voter-led system, & with a big majority. I disagree, but have to accept that.
@steve_mccabe @DJDonegal @peparkin Sadly not. Amendments were defeated, and so we are back to Govt Bill. Current proposals not promising...
@steve_mccabe @peparkin Amendment links govt's cost controls to all stages. Also committed to back amends to tighten them at Report stage.
@steve_mccabe @DJDonegal @peparkin Yes, very happy to, if that means we get a proper reform. Not quite "even he wants to change them"!
@steve_mccabe @DJDonegal @peparkin The version you support is a stitch-up. Voters will see that for themselves at the first scandal.
@steve_mccabe @DJDonegal @peparkin And no, I don't want to change them. I said I would be prepared to adapt them in the interests of reform
@steve_mccabe @peparkin @DJDonegal My proposals supported by all progressive MPs, small Parties & democracy campaign groups on left & right.
@godwyns No. In addition to empowering voters, its existence would keep MPs on their toes. But yes I believe it wd only be used in extremes.
@LeeCrawfurd @DoughtyDavidG no, but I will do now. Thank you.
Very sensible speech from @normanbakermp on the need to reform our drugs laws.
@LeonieGreene @elderflower79 @BBC Very hard to understand...
@eureferendum Fair point
@MayorWatch I think it will be a tragedy if Caroline Lucas is not returned to Parliament in 2015
Clearly the Greens deserve to be in the Leaders debate. Same number of MPs as UKIP; higher in the polls than the LibDems. Shame on the BBC.
Enormously sad that Howard Jones, former Cons leader in Kingston, died this morning. A principled man who will be very greatly missed.
@MervynRandall @38_degrees @LiarMPs @GuidoFawkes Bone and Carswell backed proper Recall. They also helped with the amendments.
@DavidChandler00 they are mad. Really unbelievable.
@JeanHaines @CromwellStuff Thank you. Will continue...
@MervynRandall @CarolineLucas @TheGreenParty @LiarMPs There are tellers for both sides. Carswell/Bone were FOR the amendments.
@waynesmith1971 @MikkiL @theresecoffey Easy to do. She's been great on the issue
@MikkiL @waynesmith1971 @SuffolkCoast15 @theresecoffey But Therese backed real recall!
@PeterJLuff @A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber If they are a minority then by definition they cannot recall an MP (except in the Govt's Bill!)
@George_Pender Here's the transcript of the debate, where these concerns were explored: http://t.co/H2TyZcnXRB
@CromwellStuff Correct, sadly. The Bill as it stands would protect David Laws and jeopardise peaceful protestors like Caroline Lucas.
@CromwellStuff @timfarron Sadly not. We lost the vote.
. @asanyfuleno List provided by @GuidoFawkes earlier today
Great that @timfarron backed real recall (along with 3 Lib Dem colleagues). Heard the arguments and changed his view. Democracy.

. @MikeGapes @tmacbond That's surely no way to talk about your constituents Mike!
@montie Wow. Big praise. Thank you.
This Labour man's (Kevan Jones) case against Recall is simple - a contempt for and an absolute terror of his voters.

@JoshOWTB here's a FAQ I wrote - http://t.co/A9TfJWEV9H
@SaileshPyPatel Any time after 4:30 (we think)
If Labour are only pretending to give Members a free vote, surely that's all the proof we need that politics needs a kick up the backside...
Cr.p. I'm told Lab's 'free vote' on Recall isn't all that free after all. Front benchers told (& backbenchers urged) to oppose #realrecall
Natascha Engel - Chair of the powerful Backbench Business Committee will be backing real recall today (@nengelmp): https://t.co/yxU5309ktG

@Closey25 Yes - free vote
Rumours that the Lib Dems will also be offering a free vote on tomorrow's Recall amendments. More important than ever to lobby yours...
@Iain_33 @DouglasCarswell Conservative, yes. Suspect the Lib Dems will have to.
@Popsie73 thank you
@kingbagcarrier tomorrow
@SaileshPyPatel Not yet. But I'm sure they will feel compelled to offer a free vote too.
Labour confirms they'll give MPs a free vote on tomorrow's Recall amendments. It's all down to individual MPs now. Trust the voter, or not?
@cranfieldadams Any time after 3:30, unless there are Statements or Urgent Questions.

READ: The wonderful @tracey_crouch makes a powerful case for a proper Recall system: http://t.co/mcVB53043j
@Selkie 3 – Asking someone if they are libDem wouldn’t normally be considered a personal attack. (unlike your tweets!)
@Selkie 2- This has been the problem with this debate. Lib Dems putting up straw men and knocking them down.
@Selkie 1- Thanks for clarifying. Nothing wrong with disagreements, but if based on false interpretation, that is a problem.
@Selkie Reading the Bill (it's short) would be the very 1st thing a normal person would do before spouting off. I'm guessing you're LibDem?
@Selkie If you bothered to read the Bill before commenting on it, you'd know it says nothing of the sort.

@timsculthorpe At present it is scheduled to start on Monday. Monday is the key day (all about Triggers)
If politicans refuse to empower people via genuine Recall ... sooner or later they will reach for more drastic solutions. Vote on Monday...

@stephentall btw -tories will have a free vote on Monday, so Clegg has a real chance to push something meaningful through. Will he take it?
@stephentall  I work with anyone, from any party to get things through. But I (& others) have been asking Clegg to engage for 4 years
@stephentall The alternative is to get rid of the Lords altogether and consider a clear separation of powers. Worth looking at in my view.
@stephentall They should be appointed by a cross-party cttee, not leaders tempted by donations, and on basis of expertise.
@stephentall We already have a trustworthy cttee to judge MPs - the constituency. Lords shd be expert scrutineers, not lawmakers.
@stephentall As a member of a Party that could make a real contribution here, surely that infuriates you as well?! 3/3
@stephentall But what is not acceptable is the dishonesty. He refuses to amend the Bill,or even engage, while pretending he wants to. 2/3
@stephentall If NC wants proper Recall, he has an open invitation to work with me&others to improve my amendments. We’d welcome that. 1/3
@trevdick @stephentall I think the H of Lords is an absolute disgrace today, but the proposed reforms would have done more harm than good.

@JJumbucks Yes. There's a link to the alternative Bill in this PR: http://t.co/N0C6vN7aJe
@TomPapworth @nick_clegg The key difference is that he didn't really mean it back in 2010.
Clegg's version of Recall is possible only by permission of Parl't & in impossibly narrow circs. He calls it 'the People's Recall'. Yes.
Magnificent Leader in today's @Telegraph urging Labour to offer a free vote on the Recall amendments: http://t.co/DohwbMyozd
.@7Kiwi @DanHannanMEP He's offering a free vote, which is a big step, & right. No hope for Lib Dems, but If Lab do the same, it will happen
@Selkie Nonsense. It requires 14,000 people to go to a specified venue in an 8-week period to sign a formal petition. A very high threshold
Clegg believes only the 'experts' should be able to hold MPs to acct, that voters cannot be trusted. There are good LD MPs. They shd step up
Clegg says Cons have resisted proper Recall, but for years he has point-blank refused even to engage with MPs. That's why we bypassed him.
Anything to avoid proper Recall, Clegg now wants an independent panel to decide. Constituents ARE independent! Why is he so afraid of them?!
@ResCitAll Good luck with it!

@Paul_Burgin @OborneTweets @DouglasCarswell I disagree. But regardless, it's not just friendship. I rate and respect Douglas as an MP.
@OborneTweets But if you want to get things done, Recall/Planning/antibiotics/Heathrow/environment etc, you work with allies, or you lose.
@OborneTweets Beside the point. I have zero time for UKIP & have said so many times (not least for reasons you've cited).
. @OborneTweets You miss the point; it's not about Party. Carswell is a principled MP & friend. Applauding him is civil, polite & right.

@SaileshPyPatel I know some of them do support real Recall, but for most I think there's a deep seated fear after tuition fees & David Laws
@W2G2H I'm sure
@IKEdmonds I think so. Realistic chance ... finally
All the small parties (bar Lib Dems) are backing Real Recall; encouraging answer from PM today; now hearing  Labour may back the amendments.
(... And will pretend they wanted it all along...! 2/2)
LibDem panic over Real Recall: 'expensive / mob rule/ not in manifesto' etc. But as Parl't moves closer to it, they will have to join in.1/2
@discovery77_ I know. It is taking far too long and I have asked for an urgent update. Z
@perrymallendane LDs polling at only marginally more. Sometimes less.
@DaveLarkhall @DouglasCarswell Compare it to his last answer on Recall, and he has moved a mile… The votes will be next week, so we'll see.

Gathering lots of names for the Recall amendments & thrilled that we have our first Lib Dem -the great @rogerwilliamsld has added his name.
@colinwforster @JohnRentoul That is true only of the Govt's Bill where just 10% can trigger a by-election (& almost certainly end a career)
@Jemima_Khan I don't think it's meant to be unfriendly.
@MrAEMiller @JohnRentoul In proper recall it is up to voters to decide if they've lost confidence in their MP.
@JohnRentoul @MrAEMiller  Wrong. Without the referendum, a tiny % can chuck an MP out. Ref stage is essential.

@R_de_Gerber @RMcGeddon @paulwaugh @MrsNoBags LibDem literature is always odd, & always relentlessly unpleasant about opponents.
@weird_spriz No!
@StigAbell Pleased to hear that!
@StigAbell Not tempted on any level! (See many previous tweets!)
. @TimMontgomerie @BBCNormanS Totally agree. The Carswell vote was exactly that -  a big Carswell vote. The H+M result was pure UKIP.
@cranfieldadams No! I support Douglas's campaign for Direct Democracy & respect his decision to call a by-election, but UKIP is not for me.
Fantastic that Rochester Cons candidate will be selected by full Open Primary. Getting serious about mending our democracy. Recall next...
Congratulations to @DouglasCarswell on his win, and for a wonderful victory speech.
@Tonsils I couldn't have been more impressed by the wildlife tour! Absolutely magnificent.
@RichmondCycling @KingstonCycling @TwickCC @LondonDynamo @kingstonwheeler Here's hoping!
@KingstonCycling @RichmondCycling @TwickCC @LondonDynamo @kingstonwheeler Great to hear
@jamesgraham Wrong. Labour are quiet, & Cons will, I believe, encourage Parliament to improve the Bill. LDs only Party actively opposing it.
@ScottMcGinnis69 @VanessaOnAir Very kind. Thank you.
@jamesgraham See: http://t.co/pHrfauPJaP . Since then the new LD central office-issued template letter is anti proper recall.
@gje7 If the panel has cyclists, there wd need to be walkers,motorists,horse riders too. w/police,parks,council, it wd be unmanageable.
@gje7 The event is to find solutions, not bash anyone. I don't know why you want to be a victim before it even starts. 1/2
@jamesgraham It is a fact that LDs are opposed in principle to a Recall Bill that puts voters first. If you have a LD MP, why not ask them?
Clegg says his mission is to open up our democracy. For the record, right now his is the only party actively resisting a proper Recall Bill

@kingbagcarrier @theresecoffey It absolutely would NOT have been scrapped. Maybe you should read the Bill.
@kingbagcarrier @theresecoffey 5- Lib Dem critique of HoL is 100% synthetic. HoL is stuffed full of LD donors with no interest in politics.
@kingbagcarrier @theresecoffey 4- HoL reform Bill was a dog's dinner. Appalling legislation, rejected by all right-minded reformers.
@kingbagcarrier @theresecoffey 3- Cons members of coalition voted for HoL (backbenchers do not have collective responsibility). ctd...
@kingbagcarrier @theresecoffey Where to start? 1- No it wasn't; the 'deal' related to AV vote. 2- Equal boundaries was in LD manifesto, ctd.
@theresecoffey The LibDems will only ever support reform where it directly helps the LD Party. Party comes first, every time.
.@BackHeathrow No one suggests they have been forced. But if they've been persuaded by your propaganda then they have certainly been tricked
@carboncoach Yes!
.@DuncanMcNab @BackHeathrow We know it's classic AstroTurf - paid for by Heathrow. How much, we don't know but it's spending like a drunk
.@BackHeathrow The APG has MPs & Peers who favour expansion. It crosses Parties & opinions. And yes he admitted your propaganda is bollocks.

@Sirbasjoe @mrjpkelly Like many businesses, & understandably, Heathrow wants to be a monopoly. Wd be a disgrace for Govt to help that happen
@Sirbasjoe @mrjpkelly You are merely regurgitating Heathrow propaganda. In fact most in Richmond support a 'better, not bigger' Heathrow
Heathrow ended its minor flightpath trials early due to local pressure. The backlash from a 3rd/ 4th runway wd be on a whole different scale
@markereiraguyer @EleanorRehahn you're very kind. Thank you!
@markereiraguyer @EleanorRehahn The paper will retract this.
@markereiraguyer @EleanorRehahn Whole point of my campaign Vs the Govt's bogus Recall Bill is that it shd empower voters, not fellow MPs 2/2

Fascinating, thoughtful speech by @RoryStewartUK. One of the few genuine experts on the ME. Why on earth is he not in the Foreign Office?
. @hillyon With a complex issue of this sort, where the stakes are so high, we need to hear ALL the argument - not only those we agree with.
Parliament shouted down George Galloway. It's a dangerous attitude, given that we are debating an issue of immense complexity.
@kewtweets @coachhotelkew @macmillancoffee I had planned to, but Parliament is being recalled.
@ClarkeMicah 'level of discourse'? What are you talking about?!

A serious debate, record voter engagement, a settled question. Direct Democracy is truly a wonderful thing.
@Jushabhesed @_charlesperry It's not that complicated. I don't rate his record generally but I admire this particular contribution.
@Jushabhesed @_charlesperry Yes GB has made a strong and welcome pitch for 'No'. But he was nevertheless a thug in Parl't, & a hopeless PM.
@Tonsils thanks so much. Any time!
@DRoberts44 @SWLondonwebed My enthusiasm for the ballot box has never needed renewal!
@ks_mikey @SWLondonwebed I agree. Any settlement must be fair and logical for the whole of the UK.
Big thanks to @thomasdaborn and @tomdsilva1 for putting on such a great Conservative Future event this evening in Richmond. Lovely crowd.
@ks_mikey @SWLondonwebed I am all for the referendum, & respecting the decision – I just hope the answer will be no.

@BelindaBG @daily_politics @nick_clegg On a personal level I like Nick Clegg, but I think he has been disingenuous on Recall.
@pperrin @KulganofCrydee @MarkReckless It's very simple. If 20% want a Recall referendum, for whatever reason, then there is one.

@Barsetter I do of course
But Parliament will have a chance to amend it profoundly at Report stage, and I hope we will have the strength to do so.
3/3 At the very 1st scandal, people will realise they've been duped, & the resulting anger will do our democracy harm. A V serious mistake
2/3 If the Govt's Recall Bill goes through as drafted, voters will be no more empowered to hold MPs to account than they are today.

@ShamrockSoup Plse stop bombarding me. The fact that it's mostly nonsense only adds to the irritation. I don't like blocking people.
@Martin_Hoscik @kewtweets feel free!
.@nickcarthew I don't claim LDs want H expansion. But like many, I note (& worry) that they've not ruled it out in the event of Coalition.
@ShamrockSoup People don't trust politicians, so the LDs need to be clear. Are they saying no Heathrow expansion if they are in a coalition?
@ShamrockSoup @JonHollis9 As a Lib Dem, you shd try to persuade your Party to come out against Heathrow expansion. That wd be useful.
.@ShamrockSoup The Lib Dems haven't ruled out Heathrow expansion any more than my party or Labour have. Hedging their bets, as ever.
The CBI & their Chancellor want Heathrow expansion, and Davies will therefore - almost certainly - recommend that. But it won't happen.
Davies: “To roll the dice on a very risky project, where delays and overruns are highly likely, would be reckless.” Is he ruling out H'row?
@theanthonydavis Heathrow expansion won't happen, but let's do the Party anyway?
Imagine if the energy spent persecuting Aysha King's family, and by extension him, had gone into tracking down real criminals.

@AdnanSadiq68 Your tweets are packed with reference to jewish conspiracies. Your timeline reveals blind hatred or extraordinary stupidity
@AdnanSadiq68 I make no pretence. I believe in a 2-state solution. Do you?
@AdnanSadiq68 Judging by your endless insane jewish conspiracy tweets I'm going to take a wild guess that you didn't vote for me last time.
.@Chriss_m Because they oppose meaningful democratic reform, & because even by standards of modern politics they are unusually untrustworthy
. @Michael_Heaver @DouglasCarswell & I'll support his campaigns on Direct Democracy as a matter of priority, as he has supported mine.
For what it’s worth, I was critiquing UKIP’s position on green issues to illustrate why I couldn’t join them. 2/2

. @RMcGeddon @DouglasCarswell No! I am not a natural UKIPer, for various reasons, but I have huge respect for Douglas.
@LouiseMensch @PeoplesPledgeEU Lots of MPs supported the PP, including me, but none were involved in the referendums, or choice of seats.
@LouiseMensch That's unfair. He (& many other MPs) supported the @PeoplesPledgeEU. Douglas had nothing at all to do with their referendum.
I hope my Party resists the tribal impulse. @DouglasCarswell is a champion, a conviction politician, a true Parliamentarian.
If Parliament had more MPs like @DouglasCarswell , our democracy would flourish.
.@DouglasCarswell is one of Parliament's greatest champions for democratic reform. I hope he is an MP after 2015, for whichever Party.
@DarrylPaxford I'm aware of that and it's very good news. I have been arguing and writing about it for many years.
In a mature & proper democracy, voters would be able to Recall their MP, Cllr, PCC or elected Mayor- if a majority lose confidence in them.
No one in S Yorkshire can have confidence in Shaun Wright, their Police Comm, & yet they are stuck w/ him. Absurd that he cannot be recalled
@liarpoliticians Agreed.
Shaun Wright says he takes 'collective responsibility', an utterly pointless gesture as he refuses to stand down- http://t.co/5vOkeGACmg

@PoliticalPics I don't need to save face. I've been hugely active locally & nationally, but clearly No MP can knock on every single door. Wed Apr 15 21:23:28 BST 2015
@PaddyBriggs It is a weak & unsatisfactory position, I agree. But it is verbatim the same as the 2012 position (which i criticised). Wed Apr 15 21:19:20 BST 2015
@PaddyBriggs @RoryStewartUK We will know in June or thereabouts, so you won't need to wait long. Wed Apr 15 20:50:17 BST 2015

@PoliticalPics @charles_fisher @paulwaugh ok but for the record your complaint (to a journo) was that I hadn't visited Galsworthy. I have 4x Wed Apr 15 18:52:38 BST 2015
@MargieBurn Am 100% convinced the Party will not give a green light to expansion. But thank you for your kind words! Wed Apr 15 18:50:31 BST 2015
@PoliticalPics @charles_fisher @paulwaugh I have been to Galsworthy House 4 times. Why not ask them? My offer to you stands. Wed Apr 15 17:11:47 BST 2015
@ColeMoreton Not news because I was referring to a position my party took in 2012, which is verbatim the position in the manifesto. Wed Apr 15 17:10:46 BST 2015
@ColeMoreton I pledged to trigger a by-election if the Party gives a green light for expansion. And I obviously would. 2/2 Wed Apr 15 15:56:02 BST 2015

@mrwilsunshine @libdemvoice If that's your view, you must be appalled the Lib Dems insisted on delaying Airports report until post election Tue Apr 14 20:21:16 BST 2015
@paulwaugh Very categoric. And remain so. Tue Apr 14 19:20:33 BST 2015
@Martin_Hoscik Agree. Front up to voters, before not after elections. Tue Apr 14 19:16:02 BST 2015
@Martin_Hoscik Can't think of alternative explanation. Without exception, all campaign groups wanted it brought forward, for obvious reasons Tue Apr 14 19:12:37 BST 2015
@paulwaugh LDs insisting on delaying AC til post GE makes it far easier for next Govt to go with bad policy. Party before community, as ever Tue Apr 14 19:09:40 BST 2015
@paulwaugh Of course it's ambiguous, and not what I want at all. But since 2012 that was always going to be the case. Nothing has changed. Tue Apr 14 19:08:07 BST 2015
@hello2youz @SamCoatesTimes @paulwaugh Amazing that anyone still does. But thank you. Tue Apr 14 19:06:50 BST 2015
@paulwaugh Incidentally the reason the AC is reporting post GE is because the LibDems insisted on it. Why? To have sthg to campaign on now. Tue Apr 14 19:05:51 BST 2015
@paulwaugh My pledge has been constant for 7 years. It wasn't a one-term pledge. And it's very clear. Tue Apr 14 19:02:42 BST 2015
@paulwaugh & I wouldn't want to, obviously. I want a red line. But nothing has changed since Commission was set up in 2012. Tue Apr 14 19:02:22 BST 2015
@paulwaugh Not what I said! You're allowing yourself to be spoon fed by a LibDem twerp. Green light for expansion = a byelection. Simple Tue Apr 14 18:57:17 BST 2015

@niwise @LHR Disagree. Not even trying to remove H from the ToR, then pushing the deadline past the election ...is both hopeless & appalling Fri Apr 03 21:22:45 BST 2015
@TheDecider25 On this issue, my priority is to stop expansion. It means working cross-party and cross-community. Am sure we will win. Fri Apr 03 20:47:45 BST 2015
@TheDecider25 @David_Cameron Likely. But Cameron isn't stuffing disingenuous leaflets on this issue through residents' doors Fri Apr 03 20:38:41 BST 2015
@niwise It is a massive issue for my constituency, and beyond. If that's what you mean. Fri Apr 03 20:36:28 BST 2015
@TheDecider25 @vincecable He has only just admitted it, and I don't know. I suspect to keep Heathrow on the agenda for party reasons. Fri Apr 03 20:00:36 BST 2015
@evenJDtweets 100% agree.  At least now we know why the Commission is reporting after the election. Disgraceful Fri Apr 03 19:59:30 BST 2015
Vince Cable finally acknowledges that Lib Dems insisted on the Airports Commission reporting AFTER the election, leaving voters in the dark. Fri Apr 03 19:45:10 BST 2015
@RMcGeddon @nickcarthew if Lib Dems won't, then residents must ask senior Lib Dems why they failed even to try to keep H out of the mix. Fri Apr 03 13:24:31 BST 2015
@North_Richmond H is back on the agenda only because it is in the ToR of the Commission. Did Vince try to keep it out? (His own answer: no) Fri Apr 03 13:22:32 BST 2015
.@North_Richmond LibDem fantasy to pretend anyone stopped expansion in this Parliament. No one (even heathrow) was proposing it. Fri Apr 03 13:22:20 BST 2015
@nickcarthew Why no answer? Do you think it's ok that LD ministers signed off & publicly endorsed inclusion of H in the Terms of Reference? Fri Apr 03 13:13:56 BST 2015
@GreenRyanColey @nickcarthew Yes of course - & I have been brutal with my own! But I am sickened by the LD weakness & dishonesty over this. Fri Apr 03 10:30:41 BST 2015
. @nickcarthew Again - Do you think Vince, Ed etc were right to sanction and publicly support putting H back on the agenda? Simple question. Fri Apr 03 09:53:53 BST 2015
@nickcarthew There were no rows. Lib Dems very publicly endorsed the terms of reference. No attempt to keep H off the agenda. Fri Apr 03 09:52:54 BST 2015
@nickcarthew I have been very critical of my party. But Vince & Ed campaign against expansion even while they put it back on the agenda. Fri Apr 03 09:51:02 BST 2015
@GuildfordUKIP I don't think brown envelope! But I do think they wanted H back on the agenda so they'd have stag to campaign on in 2015. Fri Apr 03 08:56:23 BST 2015
@nickcarthew As a Minister I'd have resigned over Terms of Reference. Unlike LD Ministers who welcomed it (& now campaign as if they didn't) Fri Apr 03 08:55:15 BST 2015
@nickcarthew How would that be useful?! I said I'd resign if they gave a green light to expansion. Until then, i campaign against it Fri Apr 03 08:53:34 BST 2015
. @nickcarthew You know my views. Do you think Vince, Ed etc were right to sanction and publicly support putting H back on the agenda? Fri Apr 03 08:51:54 BST 2015

. @BackHeathrow @richmondtimes Who is better placed than TFL to assess surface costs of 3rd runway? And which bit do you disagree with? Wed Apr 01 13:14:41 BST 2015
@DaveAlcatraz @hernehillandy You'd have thought. But no. Wed Apr 01 08:24:02 BST 2015

@sf1950 @ChrisBryantMP That's a silly tweet. This is not black and white issue, & there are strong arguments on both sides of this vote 1/2 Thu Mar 26 09:20:34 GMT 2015
@ChrisBryantMP I would prefer secret ballots on this sort of thing, but the manner in which this is being pushed through does worry me. Thu Mar 26 09:17:42 GMT 2015
.@ChrisBryantMP He's greatly strengthened Parl to hold Govt to account, which is why I am a supporter. But surely secret ballots make sense. Thu Mar 26 07:52:43 GMT 2015
@LouiseMensch I think (hope) you're right! Wed Mar 25 22:09:55 GMT 2015
@LouiseMensch Yes I think so. But I hope he would win all the same. As an MP trying to hold Govt to account, he has made my job easier. Wed Mar 25 21:54:22 GMT 2015

H'row staff have said that they've felt pressured to support your campaign @BackHeathrow. Can you say how many of your supporters are staff? Thu Feb 05 20:54:52 GMT 2015
Can you let me know @BackHeathrow how many residents have complained to you about being wrongly registered by you as a 'supporter'? 1/2 Thu Feb 05 20:54:35 GMT 2015
. @BackHeathrow Are you still counting them up? Thu Feb 05 17:27:04 GMT 2015
. @BackHeathrow How many people have written to you to complain about being added as 'supporters'? The truth please. Thu Feb 05 11:34:27 GMT 2015
@Home_Jared @bakerainlondon @BackHeathrow I don't. I only have emails from people wrongly added to their list of 'supporters' Thu Feb 05 08:56:52 GMT 2015
.@BackHeathrow I can provide examples of residents who you signed up as supporters after they objected. And you know it. Wed Feb 04 22:57:27 GMT 2015
@walkngclasshero Good to see you. Thanks for coming in... Wed Feb 04 18:36:39 GMT 2015
Advertising Standards Authority upholds complaint about a Heathrow ad about value of long haul flights. 'Misleading' & 'unsubstantiated' Wed Feb 04 16:57:04 GMT 2015
. @StopCityAirport Thanks for link. Revolving doors between Heathrow and Government continue to swing wildly off their hinges. Wed Feb 04 16:49:31 GMT 2015
Back Heathrow have registered people as 'supporters' - even if they write in to OBJECT to a 3rd runway. And Heathrow funds this sham group. Wed Feb 04 16:48:19 GMT 2015
So now it seems residents who wrote to Back Heathrow to OPPOSE expansion have ended up on their 'supporter' list (a highly suspect '65,000') Wed Feb 04 16:25:27 GMT 2015
@MarkReckless Thanks Mark Wed Feb 04 14:31:15 GMT 2015
Home Secretary has listened and responded. A very strong statement. Wed Feb 04 12:51:07 GMT 2015
Sorry- Home Secretary making statement on the CSA inquiry now, not 1:30 Wed Feb 04 12:42:24 GMT 2015
@MarinaKim_ you're right Wed Feb 04 12:41:35 GMT 2015
Home Secretary will be making an important statement on the CSA inquiry at 13:30. Worth tuning in. Wed Feb 04 12:01:07 GMT 2015
Handing a no 3rd runway petition to Number10 with MPs from left & right. http://t.co/QfyCeuKPpu Tue Feb 03 22:21:35 GMT 2015
Campaigning against Heathrow expansion with the great @uxbridgewalrus http://t.co/yIrXEcV5Of Tue Feb 03 22:20:28 GMT 2015
@nickcarthew @RPNKTories @Sarah_Tippett_ @richmondtimes Thank you. I will pass it on to her. Tue Feb 03 18:59:07 GMT 2015
90 minutes for hundreds of MPs to debate and then vote on whether to permit human genetic engineering. Surely we could have found more time. Tue Feb 03 15:30:39 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @PeteNorth303 @StopCityAirport  Will send link later showing H expansion won't add capacity, but rather pinch it from elsewhere Tue Feb 03 11:49:55 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport  As for hounding - I long for our side to have the same hounding ability as Heathrow's well oiled front group. Tue Feb 03 11:41:23 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport Everyone should be heard, but privileged access is a problem. Tue Feb 03 11:41:07 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport Effects on other airports of siphoning activity back into Heathrow etc etc etc etc Tue Feb 03 11:40:16 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport Implications of bringing 300k more people into Heathrow's noise footprint, air quality, competition, Tue Feb 03 11:39:55 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport Each group takes a different angle. Surface transport chaos/Impact on customers of recreating the old monopoly Tue Feb 03 11:39:17 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport Perhaps, but then Back Heathrow's views echo Heathrow's. It is after all a front group. Tue Feb 03 11:28:01 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport R'mond H'row Campaign, Teddington Action Gp & others were excluded while H's front group was given a platform Tue Feb 03 11:22:13 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport @BackHeathrow Also agreed. But I worry about disproportionate access Genuine community groups like... Tue Feb 03 11:19:53 GMT 2015
@NDH37087 @mjhsinclair @BackHeathrow I know it's a crazy old thing democracy but I was elected on a promise to fight Heathrow expansion Tue Feb 03 11:11:10 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport @BackHeathrow Agreed. And I am entitled to expose Back Heathrow as a bogus front group using suspect methods. Tue Feb 03 11:07:54 GMT 2015
@mjhsinclair @StopCityAirport @BackHeathrow Surely you can criticise a group without wanting to close them down? There's much to criticise- Tue Feb 03 11:03:06 GMT 2015
“@MrsChristinaO: Fabulous evening, fabulous venue, fabulous food @benwelliot @ZacGoldsmith  thank you!! X x x” Great to see you there Tue Feb 03 10:59:07 GMT 2015
@StopCityAirport @ukairportscomm @BackHeathrow Agree. It's a real worry. Tue Feb 03 10:35:23 GMT 2015
. @StopCityAirport @BackHeathrow I note that residents who sign up for a 'Heathrow Rewards' card are now being hounded for support. Tue Feb 03 10:31:23 GMT 2015
Back Heathrow has thanked me for signing their petition (clearly I did not). Sheds new light on their absurd '65,000 backers' claim. Tue Feb 03 09:05:25 GMT 2015
@davidhencke Great response David Mon Feb 02 21:09:38 GMT 2015
Looking forward to hosting Kingston's Older People's Forum at the Canbury Arms @ 10:00. All welcome. Thanks to Maundy Todd for putting it on Mon Feb 02 10:42:20 GMT 2015

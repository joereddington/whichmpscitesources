Going out campaigning but thinking about the tragedy in Nepal. It's a long way from Montgomeryshire, but can't get it out of my mind today Mon Apr 27 09:51:02 BST 2015
@admatthews can't believe you asked this!!. Been an implacable opponent of Mid Wales Connection Project since 2005. Onshore wind enemy No 1 Mon Apr 27 09:49:18 BST 2015
@markmwphoto that maybe Mark cos u don't know my stance - of last 20yrs. I back pilots to establish science, and no general cull without it. Mon Apr 27 09:39:01 BST 2015
@TheRealGarr we will be collecting all of our roadside signs within days of May 7th. It will take a day or two. There's a lot of them Sun Apr 26 22:29:54 BST 2015

@MichaelPDeacon surely it should have been a "gravelling apology". Sat Apr 25 13:19:57 BST 2015
@LauraMcAllister  and our rugby lads are unbelievable. Great ambassadors for modern sport. Sam is a wonderful example of sportsmanship. Sat Apr 25 08:28:21 BST 2015
@footballmemorys @LauraMcAllister it was a big thrill when I met John Charles in person a few years ago. UKs best ever player. A humble man Sat Apr 25 08:16:24 BST 2015
Filled up my diesel car with unleaded this morning. Upset my whole day. Too much going on in my head. All fixed now for final 12days Fri Apr 24 21:45:57 BST 2015
Really pleased that Malcolm Walker has committed to my Conservative Party. A great businessman and a even greater human being. Fri Apr 24 21:43:34 BST 2015
Montgomeryshire NFU Hustings last night. First up was Q about TTIP. Didn't expect that. And there were 6 reasonable responses! Fri Apr 24 08:20:04 BST 2015
Imagine being so desperate you would join hundreds of others on a boat to uncertainty (perhaps oblivion). Can't bear to think of Med deaths Sun Apr 19 16:14:18 BST 2015
Long day. Out for supper at Nags Head, nr Garthmyl. Good quality and value -open til 9.30, unusual in mid Wales. Bryn does a great job there Sat Apr 18 22:09:13 BST 2015
2 million new jobs since 2010 is one helluva performance. That's 1000 per day during Coalition Govt. Most of them full-time permanent. Fri Apr 17 21:19:55 BST 2015
@markmwphoto govt also has in place cattle testing and slaughter, and movement controls Fri Apr 17 08:44:07 BST 2015
@markmwphoto Mark, govt policy is to run two pilot culls in England to establish whether reducing density of badgers helps control Bovine Tb Fri Apr 17 08:42:28 BST 2015

Someday the right to buy for housing association tenants may become a reality. Not holding my breath. Prove me wrong Welsh Govt. Mon Apr 13 23:25:41 BST 2015
Just read about RSPCA sanctioning mass slaughter of seals off Scottish Coast to protect salmon fishing. Needs be, but where's consistency Mon Apr 13 23:22:37 BST 2015
@AnnGriffPlaid @ElinCeredigion nice to see Dafydd Wigley in Montgomeryshire today, even if he is campaigning for my opposition !! Mon Apr 13 22:23:36 BST 2015
Mark - you prob know my views, and I suspect disagree. I support the targeted pilot cull to establish the badger's role in disease transfer Mon Apr 13 14:11:00 BST 2015
@LeeCatterall1 nothing I can do now. Meeting advertised in Welshpool to discuss health issues several weeks ago. Sorry about that. Sun Apr 12 23:22:01 BST 2015
@LeeCatterall1 really sorry about that. Simply didn't know. Suppose my office knew I was committed. Very disappointed. One of those things. Sun Apr 12 23:05:10 BST 2015
@LeeCatterall1 What is this about? No-one has told me about it. None of us know. Have a campaign meet arranged in Welshpool many weeks ago. Sun Apr 12 22:56:37 BST 2015
Full programme of door knocking with my enthusiastic team right up to May6th. If my polling results match my fitness increase, could be good Sun Apr 12 21:46:23 BST 2015
This wk- Welshpool tmrw incl Evening meet, Newtown Tues, Dyffryn Tanat Weds incl even meeting, Churchstoke/Kerry Thurs incl evening meeting Sun Apr 12 21:26:58 BST 2015
@mywelshpool this was a great shock to everyone. Sun Apr 12 21:20:33 BST 2015
@johnlenson ironic but not illogical. I was not a fierce opponent of turbines until the Welsh Govt decided to cover Mid Wales in them. Scale Sun Apr 12 20:00:54 BST 2015
@johnlenson can't believe you don't know that my main opposition has been to the Mid Wales Connection Project. Should listen to what I say Sun Apr 12 17:15:40 BST 2015
I oppose pylon line through Shropshire/Mid Wales. Vilified as anti-renewables. The local Green Party candidate agrees with me. Now that's ok Sun Apr 12 15:37:14 BST 2015
All's well with the world http://t.co/SNIcxHIGqb Sat Apr 11 13:15:52 BST 2015
Pleased to know the Prime minister is committing any future Conservative Govt to investing whatever it takes in the NHS. Was expected by me Fri Apr 10 22:41:48 BST 2015
@dailypostwales no resend Wed Apr 08 22:26:43 BST 2015
supporter at my tonight's public meeting thought I deserved to be re-elected. "Better the rogue you know" he said. Meant it as a compliment. Tue Apr 07 22:56:49 BST 2015
I campaigned for EU exit in 1975, and am solid Eurosceptic, but Nigel Farage is damaging my cause. Not the words but the underlying message. Mon Apr 06 22:58:39 BST 2015
@huwsilk @Simonhartmp you haven't been to Montgomeryshire then Huw. Mon Apr 06 22:54:18 BST 2015

@conor_burns2015 I also think Good Friday should be a day for quiet reflection, remembering the sacrifice of those who allow us to be free Fri Apr 03 12:39:46 BST 2015
Enjoyed an enjoyable campaign meeting, and chat in the bar at Llansantffraid Football and Social Club tonight. No TV anywhere to be seen. Thu Apr 02 22:46:26 BST 2015
@andymoore1976 No. Silly question. There are no bears in Montgomeryshire. Thu Apr 02 08:09:36 BST 2015
Seems somebody asked Miliband today if he'd ever chopped trees down with an axe. Well, I cleared whole forests when I was a young axeman. Wed Apr 01 22:31:46 BST 2015
See Plaid Cymru have chosen Ann Griffith, Ynys Mon to contest Montgomeryshire in GE. Respect anyone wanting to represent this lovely place. Wed Apr 01 18:26:24 BST 2015
@AlexLeoPhillips and what will it be if it's not approved, when five years ago there was thought by many to be no hope of stopping it? Mon Mar 30 17:14:58 BST 2015
Don't feel any different this morning now no longer an MP since 0.01  this morning. Grandchildren still treating me with total disrespect. Mon Mar 30 08:45:21 BST 2015
Love the story about the yellow Lib Dem battle bus getting stuck as turning left in Oxfordshire y'day. Prob not true - funny just the same Mon Mar 30 08:43:38 BST 2015
@lawrencecg the most offensive insult made by a party leader over recent months was to describe an opponent as "dodgy". That was appalling. Sun Mar 29 23:09:32 BST 2015
Wonder if the Times will go front page on tonight's election polls!! Sun Mar 29 22:56:47 BST 2015
@alstewitn @danielbyles don't you think it was drama dressed up as reality - intended to mislead viewers to believe it to be true Sat Mar 28 23:54:37 GMT 2015
'Coalition' so totally wrong and deceiving about Cameron meeting with Tory MPs in a sort of stairwell, it's hard to believe anything else Sat Mar 28 22:43:49 GMT 2015
So Lynton Crosby approves of 'selfies'. So here's my first - with Ffion and Darragh at McDonalds. http://t.co/BGGMnOP2WV Fri Mar 27 13:54:33 GMT 2015
Been out tonight. Did I miss something interesting involving a political TV debate? My guess is not that many watched it all the way through Thu Mar 26 23:33:05 GMT 2015
@brynybrath it's also ridiculous. Not going to happen. Just a way of trying to give an impression the impact can be reduced. It can't. Wed Mar 25 07:58:41 GMT 2015
It's truly ironic that UKIP is effectively eliminating the likelihood of the British people voting to leave the EU. Tue Mar 24 23:11:17 GMT 2015
Anyone backing under grounding the Mid Wales Connection Project is trying to paint the unacceptable as acceptable. It's not going to happen Tue Mar 24 23:06:50 GMT 2015
Good to see Frank Field in the House of Commons looking fit and sprightly. You had us worried a bit there Frank. Tue Mar 24 13:58:42 GMT 2015
No-one in Montgomery which watch QuestionTime TV Leaders debates on April 30th. We have a very good hustings meeting in the Town Hall. Sat Mar 21 20:30:02 GMT 2015
And my Kerry Campaign Meeting will overshadow Opposition Leaders TV Debate on April 16th. Serves them right for not checking with me first! Sat Mar 21 20:26:54 GMT 2015
@Rowan1953 My meetings where issue will be discussed - Meifod Apr 2nd, Llansantffraid Apr 3rd, Four Crosses Apr 7th or Kerry Apr 14th. Sat Mar 21 20:10:33 GMT 2015
Impossible choice for Montgomeryshire voters next Thurs. Leaders Debate on TV or my campaign meeting at the Plas in Machynlleth. Sat Mar 21 19:57:59 GMT 2015
Am amused by the Lib Dems alternative Yellow Box budget, but they have been solid coalition partners by and large. Thu Mar 19 12:53:51 GMT 2015

@PeteNorth303 on it's own, Swansea Tidal Lagoon is unacceptably expensive, but supposed to be first of several with costs falling greatly Wed Mar 18 11:10:31 GMT 2015
Good to see the leek dominating the new £ coin Wed Mar 18 08:23:58 GMT 2015
Wonder if we'll have yet another six questions on TV Leaders Debates from Ed Miliband today at PMQs. Wed Mar 18 08:22:47 GMT 2015
Intend to say Vanuatu in the Chamber tomorrow. Hope I pronounce it correctly!! Tue Mar 17 22:36:13 GMT 2015
I've arranged crucial campaign meeting at Llansantffraid on 2nd April. I hope Montgomeryshire people come along, rather that watch TV Debate Tue Mar 17 17:15:19 GMT 2015
@jameschappers only chance of a No vote is if re-negotiation is acknowledged to be scuppered by EU intransigence - and I'm a Eurosceptic ! Sun Mar 15 12:37:20 GMT 2015
Unwinding in Cardiff Asda with a coffee while Mrs D gathers provisions. Mentally exhausted after 'the game'. Recovering for the drive home Sat Mar 14 18:29:37 GMT 2015
Playing rugby was thrilling and exhausting - but not so exhausting as being a spectator at today's Wales v Ireland game in Cardiff. Brill. Sat Mar 14 18:26:29 GMT 2015
@newtocancer @my_newtown is it all cancers? Let me know. I'll come and speak at meeting for you. Sat Mar 14 11:39:15 GMT 2015
Good to see another Conservative candidate with rural Wales experience (as well as Boris) being selected tonight - Jeremy Quin for Horsham. Thu Mar 12 23:43:20 GMT 2015
@NickServini @SCrabb2015 I still talk about it. Thu Mar 12 15:23:02 GMT 2015
@JGForsyth I noticed that too. His leader did not not at all. Just looked grumpy. Wed Mar 11 13:46:05 GMT 2015
Oh No. Not Miliband banging on about debates again. Waste of PMQs-again. Irony is that in the 3 hr NI debate afterwards, no Labour MPs there Wed Mar 11 13:42:24 GMT 2015
Been to see 'Still Alice' tonight. Hope to have recovered by morning. Tue Mar 10 23:40:16 GMT 2015
Pleased that decision on public inquiry into mid Wales wind farms being delayed until after election. Like them to be scrapped for ever. Tue Mar 10 17:26:45 GMT 2015
Congrats Sam Warburton on being named Wales Captain for record 34th time. Captain Marvellous. Tue Mar 10 17:21:19 GMT 2015
Just seen clips from Public Accounts Committee on TV News. Have to say it. Rudeness to witnesses diminishes the questioning. Mon Mar 09 23:29:08 GMT 2015
Wonder why Michael Sheen is being treated like a political authority at the moment in Wales. I think he's  very good actor. Mon Mar 09 17:59:07 GMT 2015
Pleased that LPC has recommended big 3% increase for Minimum Pay. Hope it's accepted.  https://t.co/eidm6QD844 Mon Mar 09 09:30:30 GMT 2015
@LabourEoin never supported TV Leaders Debates, but if they happen Greens have to be in. And if SNP and Plaid in so should DUP be. Fairness. Sat Mar 07 21:38:50 GMT 2015
Observer is also pretty stupid for giving publicity to something so idiotic as making it a legal requirement to have TV Leaders Debates. Sat Mar 07 21:20:50 GMT 2015
Most daft promise Miliband has made (if he really has) is to make holding TV Leaders Debates a legal requirement. Made himself look silly Sat Mar 07 21:18:24 GMT 2015
I observe the impending election is destroying twitter, and making it a home for partisan anoraks. Pity. Maybe we can have it back in May Fri Mar 06 21:34:18 GMT 2015
@lawrencecg I most certainly was. I was a candidate and outraged by the way TV Leaders Debates took attention away from candidates. Wed Mar 04 22:44:41 GMT 2015
@montie well said Tim. Neither have I. Totally sidelines local candidates. Media over-reached on this. Wed Mar 04 22:39:13 GMT 2015
What I do really like is the media who want to run the election being put in their box. Media comments on the election, not runs it. Wed Mar 04 22:36:40 GMT 2015
Personally, don't think Prime Minister should do even one TV Leaders Debate. Always been my view. Voters- go check out your local candidates Wed Mar 04 22:32:18 GMT 2015
@HulbertMathew you do if I'm asking a question, and I've asked 3 in the last 5 weeks. Wed Mar 04 13:52:00 GMT 2015
@HulbertMathew @HouseofTwits actually, immediately MPs realised what was being asked, the whole chamber fell into respectful silence. Wed Mar 04 13:37:50 GMT 2015
@lawrencecg thanks for the publicity Lawrence. Most generous of you and quite unexpected. Wed Mar 04 09:37:01 GMT 2015
I agree with Ed Davey. Swansea Bay Tidal Lagoon seem s a very good proposal. Expensive as pioneer projects often are. Hope we can do it. Mon Mar 02 09:41:01 GMT 2015
@huwsilk Wales needed that late England try to count. Would have given Wales more chance of championship. Still possible though.  30-3 Sun Mar 01 17:32:35 GMT 2015
Ireland look to be the real deal. Too dependent on Sexton perhaps. Wales will be a real test in two weeks though. Going to be a cracker. Sun Mar 01 17:28:14 GMT 2015
Good win for Wales. Never really in doubt. Prob have to win 30-3 to win championship. Been done before. Sat Feb 28 20:15:22 GMT 2015
@OwainBetts where's that. Sat Feb 28 20:11:28 GMT 2015
Best wishes to the BBC's Nick Robinson. Hope the operation goes well. Worrying times for him and his family. Sat Feb 28 20:09:43 GMT 2015
Not surprising that Wales First Minister rejects income tax powers. Hates thought of being financially accountable. All of Labour hates it. Fri Feb 27 20:24:43 GMT 2015
@IWA_Wales view on income tax powers for Welsh Govt has been clear and will be repeated when I open St David's Day Debate in HoC next Thurs Thu Feb 26 00:41:46 GMT 2015
At PMQs today, when I asked Q about organ donation, some Labour MPs made total pillocks of themselves. Their fellow Lab MPs very embarrassed Wed Feb 25 13:55:58 GMT 2015
@RealWilde I think a leaflet delivery in Montg does not cover Dyffryn Tanat. I've done one leaflet. They must've done 10 -all rubbish IMO Tue Feb 24 23:35:23 GMT 2015
My life dominated by election leaflets. Home is piled high with rubbishy Lib Dem stuff, and am now writing my own for the election campaign Tue Feb 24 23:25:30 GMT 2015
@PeteNorth303 one persons liberty to use energy as they want costs another person liberty to live free of hideous pylons/turbines. Tue Feb 24 23:09:43 GMT 2015
@PeteNorth303 and I did have a feel for what UKIP was about. No idea now. All over the place. Give me Green's harmless lunacy any day. Tue Feb 24 23:05:15 GMT 2015
@chrisshipitv the greens have already selected a candidate for Montgomeryshire, though I do not yet know the name. Tue Feb 24 22:56:21 GMT 2015
@PeteNorth303 It was a disaster. But performing on media's not everything. I've got a feel what Greens are about. More that I say for Labour Tue Feb 24 22:50:36 GMT 2015
I feel rather warmer towards the Green Party leader than I did before her interview disaster. Admired her apology. Tue Feb 24 22:45:35 GMT 2015
I rather hope the Govt will go for a 3% increase in the Minimum Wage to £6.70 as recommended. Mon Feb 23 20:28:26 GMT 2015
About time too. National Grid spent over £15million planning for Mid Wales Connection that may never be needed. http://t.co/PcSve9xT23 Mon Feb 23 08:19:35 GMT 2015
Real good old fashioned political infighting in next door constituency. http://t.co/8htTFolaDU Sun Feb 22 16:51:06 GMT 2015
Seems TV Leaders debates still on. Pity. Would completely ruin key campaign meetings I've agreed to in Montgomeryshire on 2nd and 30th April Sun Feb 22 14:09:04 GMT 2015
It's bad enough for we who seek election having distracting TV Leaders Debates. Now we also have Mayweather v Pacquiao to contend with. Sat Feb 21 17:30:06 GMT 2015

Just imagine the rumpus if Balotelli had missed that penalty!! Fri Feb 20 09:18:50 GMT 2015
@welshronald in fact Ron, you may know better than me where the Tirgwynt proposal is at. It's far more acceptable - no need for 400kv line. Wed Feb 18 22:18:43 GMT 2015
@welshronald Sorry Ron, meant to say 'Mid Wales.' In fact I think Tirgwynt has been approved but was in being before 05 but still unbuilt. Wed Feb 18 22:12:17 GMT 2015
Onshore wind developers/supporters getting nasty now. They can see writing may be on the wall for their destructive plans for Mid Wales. Wed Feb 18 13:07:45 GMT 2015
Since Welsh Govt published TAN 8 planning policy ten years ago, no onshore wind farm been given permission. Real damage to renewable energy Wed Feb 18 13:05:51 GMT 2015
@mattd_williams I resent comments saying I'm not supportive of carbon reduction/need to tackle climate change. Wind developers propaganda Wed Feb 18 13:03:00 GMT 2015
Nothing has done more damage to the cause of climate change and carbon reduction in Mid Wales than onshore wind developers. Wed Feb 18 12:44:22 GMT 2015
@davidoclubb thanks for the coverage. Onshore wind is not same thing as renewable energy - except in the eyes of onshore wind developers. Wed Feb 18 12:39:42 GMT 2015
Used to say "Hard as the jobs of Hell". Now it'll be "Hard as the teeth of a Limpet". Now quite the same resonance though. Wed Feb 18 10:13:29 GMT 2015
I enjoy my daily dose of the Telegraph, and will miss Peter Oborne's unpredictability. Genuine free thinker. Big loss to me. Wed Feb 18 10:07:39 GMT 2015
@davidoclubb  the report on what they think to be my opinion by RenewablesUK is as ill informed as you can get. And not for the first time. Tue Feb 17 18:30:59 GMT 2015
Sad to hear Dr John Davies has died. Wonderfully entertaining and erudite man. Last long chat we had was in the Goat after Pawb a'i Farn! Mon Feb 16 15:21:07 GMT 2015
Never in doubt. Now on to Paris to set up Six Nations decider against Ireland in Paris next month. Sun Feb 15 17:38:39 GMT 2015
@DanDaviesDavies I don't want to pluck a figure out of the air! Holtham reckoned £300 million a few years ago. Most think it's now much less Sun Feb 15 17:20:31 GMT 2015
@DanDaviesDavies @CerithMathias Ed Miliband refused to answer your question on funding -accused Carwyn Jones of plucking figures out of air Sun Feb 15 12:52:28 GMT 2015
Welsh Govt will protect public services says Welsh Labour First Minister. Montgomeryshire people will treat ICJ comment with derision. Sun Feb 15 12:50:21 GMT 2015
Wales will have to play well today to beat Scots on their own turf. Be close but sense the 'bounce back' factor will give us victory. Sun Feb 15 12:48:27 GMT 2015
Personally, I support secondary legislation around the Hunting with Dogs Act being devolved to Welsh Govt.Was under discussion ten years ago Sun Feb 15 11:54:37 GMT 2015
Surprisingly empty interview by Ed Miliband on Wales Politics today. Clearly totally opposed to any fiscal accountability for Welsh Govt. Sun Feb 15 11:50:15 GMT 2015
@DanDaviesDavies @roger_scully surprised Wales First Minister plucks figures out of the air. Irresponsible. He should ask Shad Sec of State Sun Feb 15 10:36:46 GMT 2015
@weyboy sorry I mean Greens are balloting and will announce next week. Sat Feb 14 22:25:59 GMT 2015
@RealWilde I'll wear suit and tie for formal meetings on campaign trail. Not very keen on rosette though. But daresay the team will insist Sat Feb 14 22:20:21 GMT 2015
@weyboy told Plaid are balloting at present. Will announce candidate next week. Looking forward to meeting and searching out common ground Sat Feb 14 22:18:13 GMT 2015
Should add that the Plaid Cymru Montgomeryshire candidate seems a decent fellow. Have to go some to be better than Heledd Fychan though Sat Feb 14 22:15:15 GMT 2015
Anyone know if the Green Party are contesting the Montgomeryshire constituency, or asking supporters to vote Plaid Cymru. Just interested. Sat Feb 14 21:43:30 GMT 2015
Met Plaid Montgomeryshire opponent today. He was out, with team, wearing posh suit and rosette. 6 wks too early. I was in jeans and casuals. Sat Feb 14 21:41:47 GMT 2015
Miliband offering more power to Wales if he wins election - but no income tax powers. Welsh Labour hate thought of fiscal accountability. Sat Feb 14 21:37:25 GMT 2015
Erwood Station Craft Centre re-opening. Brilliant news. Have our halfway to Cardiff stop open again. Sat Feb 14 20:19:02 GMT 2015
Lovely Parkinson's Disease Coffee Morning in Llanfair Caer Institute today. Packed out. Had a singing duo. Honour to be branch president. Sat Feb 14 13:59:05 GMT 2015
@katehwbaxter  agree solar is welcome. Don't really understand antipathy to large scale solar farms if close to grid and local acceptance Sat Feb 14 10:43:55 GMT 2015
Good that Cameron/Miliband/Clegg commit to 2050 carbon reduction target. It's not just about onshore wind. Yet media always feature turbines Sat Feb 14 10:37:41 GMT 2015
Laura Ashley factory site at Carno, Montgomeryshire sold to West Yorkshire Fellmongers, owners of Llanidloes abattoir. Need to know more. Fri Feb 13 23:36:08 GMT 2015

Just asked Energy Minister if powers to approve fracking for shale gas in Wales is to be devolved. She said it is under consideration. NB. Wed Feb 11 19:48:27 GMT 2015
@LindaHolt99 I think I read ecotricity has donated £250,000 to Labour Party today because of Onshore wind farm support. Can't remember where Mon Feb 09 23:45:09 GMT 2015
Interesting to see onshore wind starting to fund the Labour Party. Can see the gravy train coming to a halt. Mon Feb 09 22:52:17 GMT 2015
So Tony Abbott survives. Common sense prevailed in the end. Bit of repair work to do though Sun Feb 08 22:29:55 GMT 2015

Any evidence at all that proper processes on concussion were not followed in respect to George North in Wales/England game? Serious issue. Sat Feb 07 22:01:42 GMT 2015
Wales lost, but was a cracking game. Rugby about momentum and territory. England did it well. Wales will need to find room to run at teams Sat Feb 07 11:38:49 GMT 2015
Thought Wales would win, but not a shock at Cardiff. Not to proper rugby fans. Won't be shock if Scots win either. Be shock if Italy win. Sat Feb 07 11:24:37 GMT 2015
@RGarnerWilliams friend of mine at Welshpool rugby club used to bite off head of daffodils and eat them. And Big Mike still going strong! Sat Feb 07 11:14:18 GMT 2015
Wales lost cos Eng played to strengths, with great commitment, and some skill and bits of brilliance in backs. Wales were bullied. Good game Sat Feb 07 11:12:28 GMT 2015
The madness of our modern world. No daffodils next to fruit and veg on supermarket shelves. Kids might mistake for food - or wind turbines!! Sat Feb 07 11:07:45 GMT 2015

@sportingintel @huwsilk and it wasn't as if we didn't have Liam Williams on the bench. Fri Feb 06 23:05:09 GMT 2015
Come on Llanrhaeadr against Rhyl. Be a beautiful result if you can pull it off. Shouting for you boys Fri Feb 06 23:03:25 GMT 2015
Great wake-up call for Wales tonight. And instilling over-confidence in England before the World Cup showdown. Fri Feb 06 22:59:39 GMT 2015
@billsmith65 I did not like the England team being booed as they came on the field nor the childish stand-off in the tunnel. Need to grow up Fri Feb 06 22:57:13 GMT 2015
Two great captains leading their teams out in Cardiff tonight. Great players and real gentlemen, though not gentle men. Come on Wales. Fri Feb 06 19:50:50 GMT 2015
Doesn't seem right that little Wales should be favourites to win. Makes me more tense than usual. Cymru. Cymru. Cymru. Get it done boys. Fri Feb 06 19:10:39 GMT 2015
News today under 60s Bowel Cancer screening not going ahead in Wales. I was struck down at 58. Found early. Full recovery. Been dead by 60 Fri Feb 06 10:14:34 GMT 2015
Advice to England team before tmrw night is take in a Status Quo concert. Best prep to cope with outpouring of Welsh love for boys in red. Thu Feb 05 20:34:55 GMT 2015
Hope we're not saying "If only we'd had Adam Jones on the bench" at 10.00 tomorrow evening. Thu Feb 05 20:08:34 GMT 2015
Peter Herring, Shrews & Telford NHS Chief Exec was a friend who listened and I trusted him. Could not say that about his predecessor. Thu Feb 05 20:06:23 GMT 2015
Disappointed to learn Peter Herring, Chief Executive of Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust stepping down. He knew where Montgomeryshire is!! Thu Feb 05 20:04:21 GMT 2015
Joe Calzhage, Steve Robinson, Glyn DaviesMP - 3 Welsh fighters who take no step backwards. http://t.co/F1GGJDMKv7 Thu Feb 05 19:45:08 GMT 2015
@Amanwy you'll have to explain that one to me. Not sure what you're on about. Tue Feb 03 23:12:05 GMT 2015
@Amanwy I thought the general idea of democracy was that the people decided who should represent them, not Welsh Govt Ministers. Tue Feb 03 23:08:48 GMT 2015
Well I think William Hague has it just right on English Votes for English Laws. Tue Feb 03 23:06:58 GMT 2015
The M54 is becoming the Motorway from Hell. And roadworks on adjoining Shrewsbury By-pass will be listed as historic monuments before long. Tue Feb 03 09:39:40 GMT 2015
Welsh MPs criticising performance of Welsh Govt is not anti-Wales. It's pro Wales and pro the Welsh people. Welsh Lab Govt is accountable. Mon Feb 02 18:33:02 GMT 2015
Don't think I can vote for mitochondrial donation tmrw. It's genetic modification of embryos. Just not convinced it's right. Mon Feb 02 18:30:01 GMT 2015
Deeply concerned re YFC movement in Wales. Welsh Govt chopping public grant support. Putting so much great work amongst young people at risk Mon Feb 02 18:22:39 GMT 2015

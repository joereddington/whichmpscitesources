@claire4devizes
I'm just about to join Young Voters from the Devizes Constituency to talk politics and democracy.
I met @Se_Railway senior mgmt. today to review progress under new contract: I'll be meeting them monthly from now on.
@Wiltpensionista Yes, I am a bit of a fan too
On the vital issue of Britain's railways Labour  are policy less, useless and hopeless.
Sad but no surprise that no Labour MPs bothered to turn up for debates on East Coast mainline or SW trains.
I'm in #Morrisons Supermarket, Devizes on Wednesday 12 November from 12 noon to 1.30 pm - do come and have a chat!
And a great sunny day for a cab ride on the 0900 from Fenchurch St with Bob the driver
New trains, more seats, station wifi, smart ticketing and superb staff + free choc today!
Really good to see all the things C2C are doing for their passengers as part of the new franchise....
So pleased that war widows who remarry will now keep their pensions - fair and just.
campaigning in Rochester w/ Kris Hopkins for superb @KellyTolhurst. Let's get this great local woman to Westminster! http://t.co/Uefo7zlZ1C
@cust_faithful point is to not alert anyone til on the train - so no prep can happen. Good service this morn tho!
Great coffee at Banbury station - good antidote to a chilly morning. Train at approx 5% loading as we start bang on time
I'm on the FGW 6.07 Banbury to Paddington this morning - was one of Britain's most crowded train journeys.
Early start under a full moon - heading off to mystery ride another Top 10 most crowded rail trip
@johnprescott @ChristinaMaroc Which Jag would that be in then, John?
I'm delighted that the Coate Bridge planning appeal has been refused. We do need more houses, but not 350 in #Devizes  #localism
Nice to talk to Hayley the train manager about women working in rail: we need more of us in the driver's seat!
Reading Carswell's nonsense: I've never watched a political drama but I know how to not be an egotistical wally.
Bang on time departure: ....Britain has busiest+most punctual railway in Europe.
0758 EMT St Pancras-> Derby this morning: I do love this station.
On the other hand, the toilets on the 18.17 Peterborough to Stansted are pretty scuzzy.
Nice to hear on board train announcement  thanking passengers for their business today. Does not happen enough.
Great to meet Chris the train dispatcher on Doncaster Platform 3a - more women working on our railways needed  #CaseyJane
Such a great day seeing Immingham Port, Cleethorpes and a lot of Grimsby+meeting local businesses, council members and MPs
Signal problems mean there are delays to/from London. Bedwyn services will only run to/from Reading. I am discussing this with NR & FGW.
TPE 8.39 Doncaster->Cleethorpes now - it's the train from Manchester.
Early start to catch 0630 Kings X -> Leeds, heading to Cleethorpes with "northern powerhouse" @MartinvickersMP
@chilternrailway: and free wifi. Super useful +Govt has given £50 million to support roll out across whole network
@chilternrailway: Marlybone as charming as ever, on time departure, lots of seats, clean tidy comfortable train.
Great service today on Chiltern's 9.15 London to Birmingham
@13milepost @ConnieforLondon That would be - None.
@ConnieforLondon @13milepost Yep.  Will tweet when I'm on those journeys and we can meet up?
@technige No.  Mystery rider till I get on.
@stevewynne Tracked by the DfT since 2010 and not just London.
@woolyhat2000 I know, it seems like the obvious solution! BUT, need to invest in longer platforms at Waterloo to accommodate - happening.
Regular commuters full of great suggestions for improvements. Thanks for the info.
On time arrival. Train full from Walton and left passengers behind (next train in 7 mins).
Great station service helping passengers from the train despatch crew at Woking
Train is missing 4 coaches says very helpful guard...
On 7.32 Woking ->Waterloo. Ample seating at start but stopping service so expecting it to fill up.
Next tweet when I'm on journey No. 1.
Top 10 starts today: I'm taking the 10 most crowded train journeys in the UK before Christmas.
I'm in #Tidworth Tesco tomorrow (Fri 10 Oct) 12-1.30pm.  Please pop in to say hello, or raise any concerns.  No appointment needed.
Many of my Constituents on #vodafone have been without a signal for 4 days in the #Marlborough area.  #vodafone what is going on? #nodafone
So impressed to see great British engineering in action+hear of 000s of jobs created all across UK
Truly amazing start 2day riding in cab of Crossrail tunnelling machine "Jessica" on her final drive.
So good to see launch of "crowd sourced" standard ratings for online videos today - well done BBFC
Really good pro business speech from Matt Hancock #cpc14
Birmingham is looking fantastic as a host city for #cpc14. A real buzz and great coffee!
On the 14.28 train to Portsmouth to meet uni students and conservative candidate @FlickD
Discussing road and rail improvements needed in Eastleigh with hard working @mimmsdavies
Should have said - if other passengers see tweet and want to chat.
Heading out on 10.05  -> Southampton to visit the  Siemens Northam depot. In rearmost carriage if any other passengers seeing tweet& wan ...
Excitement building in the Perry household over the @PewseyCarnival procession this weekend!
Convoluted and chilly boris  bike from KingsX->Waterloo but good training for Sundays #horatiosgarden charity ride
Here is a letter from me to all Southeastern Rail passengers. https://t.co/5yyi1PtxPe
@MM_newsonline Sadly its a mystery shop - but can  talk afterwards!
@curium @transportgovuk Yep, to get to Pewsey station.  4 miles is too far to walk
@_neilarmstrong @Mixuju @bbcsoutheast Not meet the targets that passengers deserve.
@MM_newsonline I will be on that service seeing what's changed since last year (when these figures came out)told TPE has put on more cars
@intomlinson @fgwkmc Totally right - but need longer platforms and better signalling to deliver -which is happening
@theroyalfactor Yes. And punctuality, reliability and better customer service (like cleaner stations and more staff ) topped the list
@philmonkey Yes. Better Punctuality and reliability plus increase in customer satisfaction. If they miss them, financial hit.
Always keen to communicate on Twitter - interesting how quickly haters get abusive - see retweets.
@RonProwse @transportgovuk Ron, I do, usually from Pewsey but when I have kids/dog in tow, I have to drive. And, nice language!
@transportgovuk I've just bought a new (used) Mini Clubman.  I think I'm in love....
@ItMustBeHarriet We are investing £40 billion to achieve more capacity and more comfortable commutes.As you know, far from that now for many
@LadyFarkasBlake I thought trainers.
@LadyFarkasBlake Almost none on HS2.  And am still campaigning for electrification - the business case says YES
@MarieClaudeCECA Completely agree.  And more women working in these sectors - long term growth, high value jobs
I am so impressed by Prince Harry and his genius organisation of the #InvictusGames
@YasminQureshiMP Comfort is what passengers should be getting and are not thx to huge passenger growth+under-investment. We are fixing that.
@Fittoswan I am now!  Greetings
I hope @YasminQureshiMP apologised to  fellow travellers today for the woeful underinvestment in Northern (and National) rail under Labour
I'll be out "mystery riding" the top 10 most crowded services in the next few weeks to hear what more is needed.
We now have real info on where more trains or capacity are needed and are spending £40 billion by 2019 to help deliver it
This pro-passenger government is not afraid of of data: DfT has only gathered top 10 most crowded trains info since 2010..
@GuyHAnderson @eyespymp Facts please! I was in the middle signalling to turn into the bike stand outside the DfT. You should  have waved.
Time to head home.. once I have tracked down Zinzan the wonder dog.
@marycreagh_mp @UKLabour No answer.  Well, @UKLabour electrified <10 miles of railway track in 13 years. Pitiful.
@DerekSmith76 Errm, got Twitter up on my DfT computer! Light relief from reams of reading!
@TheFactCompiler @marycreagh_mp @UKLabour No it won't: @UKLabour have no answers on railways other than that they underinvested for a decade
Prepping for PACTs event tomorrow looking at research into drink driving by women motorists
@marycreagh_mp @UKLabour: You're objecting to peak pricing for some Northern Rail passengers: so will you will stop peak fares for all?
@marycreagh_mp @UKLabour And can you please tell me how many miles of Northern Rail network you electrified in 13 years?
@marycreagh_mp @UKLabour Not a word welcoming help for millions of hard working commuters with our RPI plus nothing cap for 2015?
@marycreagh_mp @UKLabour Is that the flex that @UKLabour introduced, Mary?
Great news that regulated Rail fares will be capped at RPI plus nothing for next year.
I'm taking the excellent X5 bus to Marlborough today - shame timetabling info at the bus stops is inaccurate - missed marketing opp
Have you voted yet for your favourite Independent Shop in the Devizes Constituency?  Voting extended to 14 Sept. http://t.co/Mm56ohHC1w
Wonderful to see and hear the Marines Band playing in Parliament tonight
@iainlaw @SW_Trains @SiemensUKNews Additional.  Plus refurb plus platform signalling works will give +30% new capacity. Really good news
@jackiebridgen @loopi_loop Agree and so pleased that MAD arrest warrant has been dropped.
Thank God common sense has started to prevail in the Ashya King case.  How soon can those poor parents get back to their son?
Delighted the Armed Forces Learning Resource 2014 is available to all schools, educating pupils on the vital role played by our Armed Forces
@MJA_Wright Hi, can I get your travel details please?  Thanks
@SparkyInTheUK As tweeted, not when delivering kids, dogs, bags etc. Clear enough I hope! Have a great day.
But, when I am carting kids, dog and bags before heading to Parliament, I will be driving. Hope that is clear.
When I am unencumbered by family detritus NOTHING is better than taking train from Pewsey/Bedwyn. Brilliant service that must be protected.
Apparently papped driving from home this morning. Hope the shot shows the 2 children, seven giant school bags and mountain of dry cleaning.
Great to visit Bath today and talk with @ben4bath about Bath's transport issues. I'm very interested in his Stop Bath Stalling campaign.
London Bridge works will transform north/south train links in SE and open up miles of new connectivity by 2018: Cambridge->Brighton anyone?
Thanks to @networkrail for showing me the extraordinary works at London Bridge & thanks to commuters for yr forbearance during blockade...
@LondonMidland What a lovely way to greet your followers!  The same to you.  Hope all services normal.
@Clarkie32 @FGW  Hi Michelle, what was the reason given for the delay?
Four More Days...to nominate your favourite local independent shop in the Devizes Constituency http://t.co/Mm56ohHC1w
After on time arrival at Paddington,off to London Bridge station to see the work causing the 9 day "blockade"
Good to listen to Reading commuters this morning- train less crowded than usual due to school holidays....
About to arrive at Reading station to meet London-bound commuters
@steve_hawkes;  I'm looking forward to getting out with you this week and telling it straight with commuters: where are we going?
@steve_hawkes. As you know, I did not claim commuters have it comfy - far from it on many routes. That's why rail investment happening....
@SparkyInTheUK Whats your route please?
@petertgarner Nope -what I said is that is where we SHOULD BE and are not.  Hence huge investment.
@In_the_Case @NASA But delivering: Reading station/tracks, New Street, E and W coast electrification, new intercity trains next year.
@SparkyInTheUK But X govt review going on on CPI/RPI
@SparkyInTheUK Really good point:RPI always used across rail industry to assess costs/contracts etc, if changed now, tax payers pay more....
@marycreagh_MP: take a hard look at Labour's Anti-Rail record: huge fare increases+low investment =misery for passengers+hindered Ec growth
Part of the Govt's package of help for hard pressed families, like tax reductions, frozen council tax, cuts in fuel duty....
And despite this huge spending, fares increases capped at RPI plus Nothing this year...
Which is why our unprecedented investment in trains and track so desperately needed...
Thx for all the Tweets. Am totally aware that some commuters are NOT travelling in comfort - when they can get on the train..
Silly piece in Daily Mail today. Some commuters ARE NOT paying fair fares for a comfortable commute. Hence huge rail investment.
Great to welcome Minister for Civil Society, @TweetBrooks to Devizes to discuss community organising.
Last government electrified 10 miles of rail track in 13 years.  We will electrify 850 miles meaning faster and more reliable journeys o ...
And now Labour want to abolish the fare flex -is that the one they set at 5% that we cut to 2% to help hard pressed commuters?
Amazing how Labour are silent on their toxic track record of inflation busting fare increases plus underinvestment in our railways.
@HSBC_UK_Help. I have been trying and failing to open an account with you for weeks now.  Really appalling service.
@shoutsatcows Bless.  There was a live link in the comments below the page.  But don't let the facts get in the way!
WHAT  an amazing victory for the England Women's Rugby Team.  Totally inspiring. How can girls take up the game?

@HelenGoodmanMP And shouldn't we on a cross party basis be condemning this ridiculous sexist nonsense ->colour of my (£30) jacket?
@HelenGoodmanMP Tragic that sensible female MP like you can't tell yr Labour bully boys to get stuffed when they give you nonsense to tweet
@HelenGoodmanMP Wow Helen, I can't imagine you actually think that given how much work we have done together on child protection online.
Wide awake, head full of my new brief and find myself composing a suitable spotify list for the job..best train songs?
Local unemployment down again this month.  Now just 575 people seeking jobs across the Constituency and down 36.8% in the last year. #jobs
I am so looking forward to being part of the DfT team rebuilding Britain's infrastructure
I hope tChurch of England finally does the right thing today and votes for women bishops. Break that stained glass ceiling!
My thoughts and prayers are with the local family who have so tragically lost their little boy today.
I am so pleased that my friend, talented businesswoman and constituent @SelaineSaxby was selected for Llanelli!
Just finished another Statutory Instrument Committee where the consequences of legislation are thrashed out - that's 3 so far this week
@mrchrisjohn Not only are you insulting, but in this case you are senseless.
@mrchrisjohn Show me one example, just one, of that ever being reported. PITIFUL class warfare.
Disgusted that @BBCNews et al use the tragic death of Horatio Chapple to carry on their class warfare. Who CARES where he was schooled?
Why does reporting of inquest into absolutely tragic death of Horatio Chapple start with name of his school?  How is that REMOTELY relevant?
..Securing this money was a top priority!
I'm absolutely delighted that the new Growth Deal money for Wilts includes funding to train people leaving Armed Forces locally.....
Buzz building in Parliament Square ahead of The Tour!
@BernardMcEldown Sorry but repeating lies does not make them true.  As per today's stats, relative poverty is falling, thank goodness.
Interesting that Farage and his merry band turn their back on EU anthem but accept EU salaries - and don't do much for them either
@BernardMcEldown A tax is what the government takes. Reducing housing benefit(like Labour did in 2008) is the government giving people less
I'm extremely proud to be part of a government  that has helped take 300,000 children out of poverty since 2010
Really encouraging news today that percent of British people living in relative poverty is  at the lowest level since 1980s
Biggest ever increase in ISA limit from today - help for all those saving for their familes' future https://t.co/bOVtFM9yHL
Great to see growth upgrades for UK economy today: 2014 3.4%: 2015 3%.  We are securing Britain's future.
Sadly the fragrance of the portaloos being emptied in New Palace Yard is not so inspiring
The union flag flying today from the Victoria Tower looks particularly majestic bathed in Westminster sunshine

Structural deficit. Gap between tax and spending. Grew every yr from 2002. Thanks Labour
@VinnyITV They sould be thanking him for dealing with Labour's deficit so they don't have to
@waynesmith1971 @BenPBradshaw @drwollastonmp and as a Party that presided over scandals like Mid-Staffs, you should be collectively ashamed
@waynesmith1971 @BenPBradshaw @drwollastonmp With respect Wayne, maintaining funding and focusing on patient care is not destruction....
@MMaryMcKenna @helenmilner I am glad she was!
@MMaryMcKenna I came in at the end of yr speech- apols.  But huge progress for them and others on connectivity in job search,.
@BenPBradshaw @waynesmith1971 @drwollastonmp She is a proud Conservative and like all in my Party wants to nurture our cherished NHS.

@cobibudgeuk Oh THATS why @Ed_Miliband went there and did the car crash @BBCWiltshire interview - to make sure Labour didn't win!
@johnpockos Hope to earn your vote next year John
@SWLabourParty @RobertBuckland @annesnelgrove I think after many years of ineffective Anne, the people of S. Swindon know better.

Happy Birthday to Anna Pandoulas who helps me sort out problems for my constituents with her blend of intelligence and efficiency.
Enjoying a by election bun AND a Nelson slice from ALG bakery Newark. Lots of blue icing for rob4newark
A great night to be out in Bingham supporting Rob4Newark!
@CLeslieMP @DJack_Journo  You still look fabulous. See you in Newark!
Then visiting Kings Royal Hussars to have coffee with spouses, discuss rebasing and travel in a Challenger tank.  No Maggie-style photos!
First up today - Governors meeting at St. Johns Academy, Marlborough
It's just way too late to be in Westminster and Zinzans's snoring in my office is getting annoying.  Homeward bound I think!
@AylaMichelle @MediaGuido .  Sounds like total rhubarb to me. Hate labels and anyway am a Maternalistic Conservative as I have 3 children.
Investigating complaints about excessive low and night flying at Keevil airfield - disruption can't be good for children in midst of exams
Ed Miliband is STILL yet to comment on @AVMitchell2010's foul tweet.  He must be out of his meeting with Axelrod by now...
@pollypeel @stellacreasy It only works amongst women - sorry mate.
@orangarnold you are kidding, right?
Right got Whips work to do.  Enough tweeting.  Looking forward to seeing the Labour ladies in the Lobby.
@Stellacreasy, Honey I was a feminist while you were in nappies.  Now woman up and get your dinosaur colleague to apologise.
@Willowman66 @stellacreasy @HarrietHarman Parliament is in session and we are all...Members of it??
@stellacreasy So if you don't know what the issue is, why are you commenting?  Suggest engage brain before mouth (or fingers?)
Amazing to see Labour female MPs rushing to defend the indefensible.  Political ideology triumphs. Dear God.
@stellacreasy; Are you really suggesting that casual use of terms of sexual violence from Labour MPs is OK? Wow. Speaks volumes.
Where are @stellacreasy @Harrietharman and the other Labour women who claim to campaign with us on violence towards women? Totally shallow.
Suggest @AVMitchell2010 deletes tweet and apologies profusely. A disgraceful mistake as is the deafening silence from @UKLabour
Just phoned @AVMitchell2010  to say fine to have political debate about Pfizer/AZ but never acceptable to use rape as a corporate analogy
A disgusting and offensive tweet from Austin Mitchell @AVMitchell2010.  What will you do @HarrietHarman? Rollup by election.
@Charles_Laing Only for Whips - tiny perk of the job, to make up for long hours and aggro possibly!
@GlenysThornton Ha ha - yes, I might well get shifted to the back benches but will still be a proud Conservative MP #Labourlosingeverywhere

@LadyDurrant agree entirely. Have written to Attorney General to ask for urgent review. Multiple cases of online grooming now.
That's @JennyWillott who has done almost all of the front bench slots for the govt today - and brilliantly too.

Churchill Insurance - your customer service - Oh Dear! 
That's one lost customer.
@neilbichard But I am trying to give  Churchill premiums!
@Highlander1809 That would be "Oh No" in this case.

@HarrietHarman I think any comment from you is a mistake given the unsavoury mess of allegations around your past associations.
@anntreneman: Ann, I may be tall but am definitely female #Whiponduty
On May 10th I’m walking 26 miles overnight to raise #breastcancer awareness! Please support #TeamMPMoonWalk here: http://t.co/oHPnZaOAyl
So glad to be the duty Whip for statement on Bovine TB- having a disastrous effect on the dairy farmers I represent
@Kevin_Maguire your winner will be paying less for that pint thanks to this great government #CheersGeorge #onthesideofworkingpeople
Yes - its the Big Hawaii birthday.  No- I am not Nigel Farage's long lost twin sister. LOL!!  but Happy Birthday to all other 3/4/64 babies
Thanks for all the Birthday wishes!
Good to hear that there is finally a ticket machine at Bedwyn station-we can finally get better passenger data to prove station popularity
Just had word that Eric Pickles has agreed to my request to hear Coate Bridge planning appeal. Public inquiry from 8/4 in Devizes Corn X ...
Little-noticed but hugely important piece of diplomacy:visit of @WilliamJHague & @DavidCameron  to N.province of Sri Lanka: first since 1948
Superb news;   @AngieBrayMP  campaign for for tougher laws on cyber stalking and trolling succeeds http://t.co/oSwNJwdDcI
Discussing links between global North and South at the Parli group for Connecting Communities with Justine Greening
This is possibly Rachel Reeves weakest speech so far - reduced to quoting the old Etonian George Orwell. Nice jacket though!
The fall in the inflation rate to a 4 year low is really good news: help with household budgets for all in the Devizes Constituency
@tomwilson23 no - but its a great start!  Cannot be right to have intergenerational worklessness. Have a good night.
@StuartLong01 Have a look at Table K - last column I think
@tomwilson23 Working poverty is a huge problem - but surely better to be employed?  Labour would do better if they grasped this!
Plan A is working - literally: 290,000 FEWER children are growing up in workless households since 2010.
@OllieWiggins91 Hi Ollie, google the local Association and give them a call! Usually very friendly - well mine is anyway.
@afneil,your demolition of @ChrisLeslieMP over the "bedroom tax" that isn't = vintage TV. I salute you. Thanks @GuidoFawkes for  the clip
I found my #FirstTweet: https://t.co/mj00XVIEC3. What was yours? https://t.co/5bUzFwIIk4
@Handbags82: guess you don't visit the great British seaside much!
@CllrDave4Gornal: the crisis hit. We were the worst prepared country for it thanks to Labours policies. Proud of that?
And some might ask - can Labour be ever trusted to even run a whelk stall again given the mess they made of the British economy
The sheer terror on the faces of the shadow DWP team at the thought of trusting savers with their own money is a sight to behold
Listening to great presentations on Marine Science in the HoC to mark Natl. Science & Engineering Week
@allriffnoraff That would be.... No!
Here's a helpful breakdown of yesterday's Budget for Makers, Doers and Savers http://t.co/NxqwjJz0nJ #Budget2014
@HarrietHarman And not only an insulting comment but false: 24% of full Cabinet Cons are women vs. 14% under your lot. Apology perhaps?
@HarrietHarman Harriet, if anyone in my party had cracked that "joke" you would be howling.  Deeply disrespectful comment.
I'm so pleased that the hated forced annuity rule is to be scrapped - will be popular with the pensioners I represent
@GeorgiaTP @ChrisJLovelock No.
The only joke in today's #Budget2014 debate was @Ed_Milliband 's repsonse. "Worst speech in 16 years" says a senior MP
According to @HarrietHarman, referring to female Conservative MPs as "girls" was a Milliband joke. We are not laughing.  Outrageous.
And conservative female MPs are Girls? OMG this gets worse by the minute!
Ohhh dear we are in to class warfare territory ...
I have genuinely never seen the Oppo benches so glum. Milliband floundering in his fact free response #Budget2014
And our Devizes brewers, pubs and beer and cider drinkers get a duty freeze/cut #CheersChancellor
Businesses see a doubled £500k investment allowance, raised R&D tax credit, best export finance regime in Europe...
Wiltshire savers will get a new merged 15k ISA, abolition of 10p savings tax, new pensioner bond and massive reform of the pension system...
Great to see a the Chancellor announce a huge package of support for businesses and savers in Wiltshire #Budget2014
@JudiLembke @hillyjanes @EleanorMills @WIJ_UK I was in Tory Blue!
@PSbook The Sun's #checkemtuesday campaign hasn't confused me. #NoMorePage3

@SDoughtyMP At the request of the person running the ballot! #badloser
@CCHQPress @edballsmp I would be happy to advise the Shadow Chancellor.  First piece of advice? Apologise  for wrecking the British economy
I'm not impressed that RUH has withdrawn X-ray service from Devizes hospital.  Long term solution needed.
Just met Sunny, the sniffer labrador,  in the Members Lobby - he has dwarfism! Awww.
@stellacreasy: not "trying"anything: genuinely surprised at yr claim. Tax payers money is precious. Try sponsorship?
I'm impressed with the @stellacreasy snack attack - but how can she claim IPSA expenses for presumably political volunteers?

Im pleased that OFgen will investigate SSEs performance over Xmas power outages...4 day cut offs for some constituents.
Kicking off an excellent debate on the economic contribution of women.
Great day for cycling to work, thanks @BorisBike
@Ontablets Good point!  But perhaps not trying to respond to issues from Constituents and prob issued with ear defenders.
Anyone else trying to work in the middle of a building site?
Finding it hard to do any work in our office given that drilling outside Norman Shaw North is reaching ear-splitting proportions
@MarkCF83THFC @afneil He is a serious chap and these are serious matters
@RossHaynes92 He always looks like that.  Serious times
@GregCATaylor These are serious matters and he is a serious chap
@iBreezeblock Hmmm, first time I have been called that for sure!
@mattyhale I am asking for the Appeal to be heard by Ministers.  I think this is a development too far for Devizes.
Meeting Eric Pickles earlier asking him to "recover" Coate Bridge development Appeal (get it decided by ministers) http://t.co/iwLPBi5yP9
@ceno_byte Funny but sadly untrue.  But Hey, never let the facts get in the way of a story.
Please support National Apprenticeship Week this week. New apprentices in Devizes gave local businesses a boost of £4.3m last year.
@LouiseMensch Agree: a Yes vote is for Scottish Separation,not independence #BetterTogether
@radicalj Sadly no, used it this morning in St. James Park!
@GuidoFawkes So far in life I've changed hundreds of nappies, collected tons of dog poo + picked up mountains of snotty tissues. No more
A rather manky hanky has been dropped on the plinth of the Speakers Chair and everyone is loath to move it. Been here for hours.
@NFUsouthwest @NFUtweets Minette Batters is a great choice and a fine Wiltshire farmer.
@liztmitchell Last time I looked we were increasing spending on the NHS unlike Labour who refused to protect it. #facts
....oh and a few facts wouldn't go amiss either.
Perhaps the Bishops should sort out their own stained-glass ceiling problem for female clergy before wading into political debates...,
People everywhere, incl. in the NE,want to work, have good public services and help their children get on.  That's what Conservatives offer.
@nickswift @grantshapps I went to Nailsea Comprehensive school...
A great morning out campaigning with @nickdebois and his team.  Everyone working so hard for Enfield North
@NatRothschild1 @GregBarkerMP @FarmerGavla: it's a great operation and am so happy to see all the innovation in our area
@TheFoodGallery @debievans7 I could do with one of your incomparable brownies about now.... Feeling jaded on the green benches!
@gregclarkmp Congratulations!
@Sallyroberts @cwowomen Congratulations!
An excellent and well attended adjournment debate on planning in national parks is proceeding thanks to Totnes's MP Sarah Wollaston
@stellacreasy @GavinBarwellMP @matthancockmp @Mark4WyreForest Gavin is a Tory Whip.  Keep up Stella!
As with the economy, so with DLA assessment contracts: Labour create a huge mess and we clean it up.
@CllrWhitehead: perhaps he doesn't know what happens as, unlike me, he doesn't live in our lovely Constituency!
@HarrietArkell just following this up - could you email your mother's contact details to http://t.co/0vLlm3qWok@parliament.uk  Manythanks

@cinders_skivvy A pleasure to help; I am glad we finally got a result, and yes lets meet up - at a Devizes surgery perhaps?
@HarrietArkell I will chase up her email and make sure I reply!
@HarrietArkell Harriet - I met with various flooded householders and reps of the Parish Council -various action points as per letter to PC..
@simonburch: could you email me with deteils   to http://t.co/Buk9e1ckzx@parliament.uk? Thanks
Very waterlogged all around even on the Greensand-  looks like no ploughing will be possible for weeks..
Great to meet the residents of Coombe End Ct. in Marlborough today and also help to open the new Post Office in Bromham
@Labour_News @ElizabethHobso6 That is total and utter fantasy and Pat, who I respect, should know better.
off to Marlborough to celebrate the 100th birthday of Harry Beckhough - a Conservative Party member for 85 years!
@FGW any update on the 10.17 Pewsey to Paddington please?  Claire
@FGW Many thanks indeed.
@FGW and is their any disruption to the service with engineering works closer to london?
@FGW Morning Olly - around 10am
@FGW Morning - you must all be exhausted - are trains running Pewsey->Paddington?
Game of Life (Hector won) and early bed as the wind howls in Wiltshire....the groundwater is rising and sandbags are ready.

Very productive day seeing new technology at Grant Energy with Minister @GregBarkerMP
@DerekSmith76 Average income in my constituency well below national average. Green does not equal wealthy.
Business confidence is at 22 year high - good news for people working in Wiltshire or looking to start their own company locally
I voted No to the Ban. I totally support the principle but think it  will be unenforceable. Education needed.
I'm upstairs in a Statutory Instrument Committee on Planning - main debate in the Chamber  hasn't started yet...
@AlanEngland4 @GuidoFawkes British and proud of it.
@NetworkString For the 100th time, its a consumer choice.  Existing filters.
@Hayley_Barlow @Channel4News Neknomination is dangerous viral behaviour by minors. @facebook sort yr policies out.
@NetworkString Internet is filtered at the device level already- ISPs are raising filters to the home network level+giving consumers choice.
I'm looking for feedback from constituents ideally, not my "hands off my internet" followers. Thanks!
I'm undecided about today's vote on smoking ban cars w/child passengers. Heart says "ban it", head says "unenforceable bad law". Thoughts?
I've just had a productive working meeting with Thames Water reviewing solutions for flooding in Bedwyn & Aldbourne http://t.co/IyfpvryC78
@joswinson @rebecca_rutt And huge credit to Conservative Minister @janeellisonmp who has campaigned tirelessly on this and changed UK law
@iBreezeblock Maps, guides, hydrological charts and a series of things to do
@pharrap @graphiclunarkid You clearly have never read or heard a word that is said on filtering proposals.  Even on the radio!
Sending all my best to Pewsey heroine @ShelleyRudman @TeamGB #Devizesgirlpower
@_katedevlin I don't think that is surprising as he almost never attends the House of Commons
About to have a working session with Thames Water on solutions for flooding in the Bedwyns and Aldbourne. Any more flooding news locally?
@weborguk do grow up. Or perhaps get on with some work like the rest of us are trying to do!
@mrowebot @graphiclunarkid afraid that's total rubbish too. Filters are current device level (or better) lifted to home network.
I'm seeing road flooding reports for the centre of my Constituency? Temporary run off? Road drains? Any info appreciated #stuckinwestminster
@DondonHarris @BBCWiltshire @SpireFM @wiltscouncil How bad is this episode? Is it on the E Royal road?
@graphiclunarkid This is a classic example of the total rubbish talked about giving families more help to manage internet access.

Delighted that the House of Lords have accepted the Commons decisions on the Lobbying Bill.  Common sense.
Well that wasn't worth waiting for. Bluster and Balls. On a Labour front bench near you.
@stellacreasy Bless.
@edballsmp is chuntering constantly from a sedentary position but lacks the cojones to speak from the despatch box
Labour has no Balls today... @edballsmp has yet to say a word ...
Trea questions today will be interesting but not complacent. After worst recession in living memory we still need the #LongTermEconomicPlan
@Daily_Ref @BBCNews Because the BBC newsniks call political bias impartiality
UK GDP Q4  at 0.7% and sustainable thanks to our #LongTermEconomicPlan.  @edballsmp, how's that Plan B looking?
A superbly powerful speech from @chrisskidmoremp on the law on dangerous driving
Big headline.  Disaster in the detail.  http://t.co/gHBU4ZALiS  #sameoldlabour
Just leaving a hugely informative meeting on the floods in the Bedwyns- well done the Bedwyn Flood Group for organising
@buttonsandfluff I disagreed and still do with your evidence which is entirely anecdotal. Scaremongering.
@crispibits @BBC   I have to say, I rarely meet anyone from any political party who thinks the BBC do an unbiased job!
@crispibits @BBC Have you ever met a right wing BBC employee?  I havent in the dozens I have met. Not one.
Hey @BBC: here is your challenge for today: Celebrate the great news for Britain in this the employment data without criticism. Can you?
...they talk about threat to interest rate rises. Which has been rebutted by the Bank of England. Thank god for Twitter and the truth!
Once again the @BBC shows the left-wing bias deep in its DNA with coverage of superb news on unemployment.  Instead of unequivocal welcome..
@myleslongfield @Mike_Fabricant @WitneyCF @_Liam_Walker_ ummm no thanks.  Too sticky
Another fall in Devizes unemployment - and nationally the biggest quarterly rise in employment since records began #longtermeconomicplan
@NigelFarageNews comments would be a joke  if not so pitiful. Wonder if he has ever met a - gasp-  working mother?
An hour off bench duty so I am speed reading the comprehensive draft Devizes Neighbourhood Plan
Yvette Cooper is shamefully partisan with her UQ on help for Syria - Britain is leading the world with aid and support

Fridays in the Chamber do delay my return  to Wiltshire but offer a snapshot of real democracy with a parade of Private Members Bills
Another Labour failure - BoE's Mark Carney rips apart Labour's bank plans. Would NOT boost competition http://t.co/RbAYTTmGgd
I am so pleased to hear that the wonderful Caen Hill Marina in my constituency has won Inland Marina of the Year award 2014.
Another day, more baying from the mob on Twitter.... for example....
@Tara_Hewitt you are not wrong and Diane is much more attractive than this!  Waste of taxpayers' money in my view
Labour demonstrates as clearly as ever it will never reform welfare. Can't and won't. Ever.
Chris Bryant says Labour will be tough on welfare by  getting people into work. Hope he welcomes the growth in jobs this Govt is creating.
Fascinating to see rampant socialism raging on Labour back benches. Tax! Spend! No welfare reforms!
local councils have spent less than 50% of money given them to help those affected by housing benefit changes
Labour just claimed 50 per cent of people affected by changes to housing benefit have contemplated  suicide. Evidence?
IMHO this is the way to keep Great Britain great! https://t.co/pAgl25Iadm
Good to hear many excellent speeches on the challenges facing rural communities-very  relevant to my area.

Miliband to fudge deal on curbing union influence - weak @Ed_Miliband bows down to union baron pressure again http://t.co/sDzthL7LLR
But it is inexcusable for their front bench MPs to spend the entire debate tweeting/emailing/online shopping ? as happened on Weds.
As they know, important debates take hours, MPs are in an out and private (sometimes funny) conversations take place
I do hope Labour MPa will never again be tempted to tweet about people laughing during debates..http://t.co/nL2V5ZRbdN
@MatthewGPearce @MarlboroNews Would you like to join me?  Or just carp in the usual partisan way?
@RichardBurdenMP I assume you were not listening?
@BarryGardiner Sorry, but you carried on when your own benches were speaking.  If nothing else, its incredibly disrespectful to  speakers.
@BarryGardiner:  Barry as you have spent most of the debate tapping on your phone (xmas shopping?) some might wonder why you are there?.
@UKLabour @govmixx You will of course not hear one of them explain why food bank usage grew 10 fold under their government.
@tax67 Under this government, 2 million lower earners taken out of tax COMPLETELY
@IrkHudson @RachelReevesMP Labour spent more than took in taxes EVERY year since 2002.  nothing in the coffers when financial crisis hit
@tax67 I have plenty of constituents living in poverty and am utterly committed to helping- 20% fall in unemployment locally so welcome
@davebrownrigg @adamboultonSKY No, every Labour govt does that and then the Conservatives fix the mess. Unemployment DOWN.  Growth UP.
@labourpress @RachelReevesMP As you know, there is orchestrated shouting from dozens of Labour including those " hiding" in the aisles.
It takes neck for @Ed_Milliband to stand there every week as economy recovers+unemployment falls knowing he has voted against EVERY measure
@RachelReevesMP Who?  Simply not true without names. Whereas yr colleagues continue to shout through every one of the PMs answers
@a_nallbeads An update is scheduled for the Tidworth Area Board Meeting, 22Sept 2014. I've more details if you’d like to send me your email?
Amazing that in 2008, the at height of Labour's financial crisis, @RachelReevesMP government refused to refer JSA claimants to #fioodbanks
@RachelReevesMP I'm hoping you are celebrating the Government's improvement in benefit processing: 92% paid on time -up 6 per cent on Labour
@RachelReevesMPUse of #foodbanks went up 10-fold in the "boom" years under Labour& yr govt refused to refer JSA claimants to them..

Powerful speeches this morning during our line by line scrutiny of the Mesothelioma Bill during its Committee stage.
So pleased to hear that Wiltshire Families First & Cllr Richard Gamble have raised over £5500 to help  vulnerable young people in the county
Great to see queues at Marlborough's Hedgerose florist & Sumbler Bros butchers #smallbizSaturday
@martinstarke Dear God, do I really look like that?
I have, however, been told to "stop chirping" and called a "posh b**tch" by unreformed dinosaur male Labour MPs (you know who you are)
I've been in HoC for several years longer than Sarah Campion and have not once witnessed the behaviour she claims to have seen...
How we are supporting small businesses - http://t.co/rrvri8x5Ll #AutumnStatement
Tune in now for vintage @BBCPM political bias. They just can't help themselves.
@SupremeDevizes I am planning on it - see my @wiltsgazette column today! And will be helping sell Xmas trees at Burbage also
@SupremeDevizes @DevizesWilts damm; am on the green benches and won't make it - but home tomorrow .
@realhatsmatter texting the speakers to tell them to be here for wind up speakers.  Parliamentary protocol.
@crispibits Indeed! Everyone likes a science geek - inlcuding me.
One of the best parts of today's news: http://t.co/qlJjyTkCXl  
#AutumnStatement
@ChrisBryantMP Clearly you have not spoken to your Whips and  colleagues  who have almost lost their voices! Partisan nonsense
@MarkCF83THFC  I tend to agree
@crispibits back at my desk now - have a look at this -  a bit simplistic but useful I think?
http://t.co/UzQkB8cydZ
@ChrisBryantMP Neither do your colleagues sadly.  First rule, support your Leader and Chancellor - but not today #EdBallstrainwreck
I think we should change the Shad Chancellor's name to Ed Falls after today,
It would be lovely to see the wonderful @maryportas welcoming the huge good news for High Streets in  today's #AutumnStatement
@marcokeeffe  indeed!
Alisdair Darling looks as if he is praying for a miracle as the Labour benches empty like a bath with the plug pulled out #AutumnStatement
Oh dear. @edballsmp This is so poor. No plans, no idea, no leadership.  God help Britain if Labour ever elected again
@crispibits you are totally right - if only the oppo didn't do it...
Let's chat when all calmed down
I've think  @edballs should calm down - oh all right then "dear"
@EdMilliband is wincing as @edballsmp digs ever deeper. Oh dear. Tory gain
@crispibits I think this is a great plan for Britain :-)
A great package for the town+village high streets of the Devizes Constituency.  Looking forward to Xmas shopping this #SmallBusinessSaturday
Hurray!  Business Rate reduction of £1000 for every retail business with rateable value up to £50k. Good news @TheFoodGallery
The business rate cap should be very welcome on the high streets of Devizes, Marlborough and Tidworth #AutumnStatement
Labour utterly crushed by this #AutumnStatement.  It's all totally sensible, long overdue and they will oppose every measure #sameoldlsbour
A locally important announcement: an extra £100mm for service projects/ charities @wellingtonacad reapply?
@EdMilliband looks ashen. @edballsmp looks miserable.  Will they oppose the welfare cap?
Labour benches silent apart from mutters of  double debt thereby showing their complete economic ignorance #stabilisers #laboursdeficit
Britain now growing faster than any major economy including France with its Milliband-endorsed socialist policies
#AutumnStatement
I am really proud of the Coalition benches today - superb speeches from a pro-entrepreneurial government

@ChukaUmunna he isn't but an old fashioned note on HoC paper might do - and you could snap and tweet it!
@GeorgeMorrall @ayeup is this a serious question? Becos we need jobs. Exports create them. China a huge and growing export market....
@politicshome what we have, thank god, is a series of policies to give British children the best possible education.

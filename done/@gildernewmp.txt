@CiaranMaxi10 comhghairdeas to all of you Ciaran, hope Claire gets LOTS of TLC! Enjoy your gorgeous baby xoxo
@sinnfeinireland let's hope @DGNHurlingclub get their hands on some of that, facilities badly needed now!
@give_it_a_lash @SaveExploris that's certainly the impression I got too.
@moyla18 would you be interested @AghalooOfficial?
@SaveExploris great news, but I was dismayed to hear a UUP Cllr complaining about the Exec putting '¬£1m into a fishbowl in Portaferry' today
Comhghairdeas @wendytalksback and Karen on your wonderful news, delighted for you all!
@AaronKernan comhghairdeas to you and the woman who did all the hard work Aaron! And great game yesterday btw....
‚Äú@Renzo_Soprano: I always leave my hotel room like this, just to mess with the maids: http://t.co/pnpdY8V4HD‚Äù @TerryBMcCartney
@CrossanBrendan I read the first line of that Brendan, and in me head I was thinking 'Gay Pride Parade'.....
‚Äú@gerrobo: Although I'm not in Belfast wishing all my gay friends a great gay pride weekend #br√≥d‚Äù Me too, hope the rain clears!
Clan McKenna @BrantryBARD earlier this evening - live on @bbcblas - @LynetteFay @GinoLupari
@NiallOfficial I've seen fatter legs hanging out of a nest - get some beef on ye lad!
@f_p_s_13 @spdoran such cynicism in one so young....
@lizmcshane I'm more upset that Tyrone's out of it tbh Liz!
@petercardwell I'd have been indulging in a bit of wishful thinking involving 3rd Sunday in Sept and @TyroneGAALive....
@barrabest @grainnemcgarvey thanks Barra, what's the rest or the weekend looking like (and apologies if you're not working today!) üòé
@BrantryBARD gearing up for a brilliant weekend at The Brantry Fleadh...@GinoLupari @LynetteFay
@grainnemcgarvey wee bit damp in The Brantry this morning but I'm an optimist! Whaddya reckon @barrabest?
@jmcconville7 @grainnemcgarvey @Grainne_utv @Gwilkinson_utv @Gardnerjulie @JG14ver @nigreenways @SigningSal thanks - have a great Friday üòé
@spdoran it certainly puts Fermanagh to Belfast or Dublin to shame! I'm sure someone knows who that hardy soul is!
@spdoran will have a think about it and ask around, but not off the top of me head...
@PhilFlanagan @ItsMeHugoD @shepmahon and us just talking about it the day - will the class of bachelor we know from Boho go to it?
@FrancieMolloy enjoyed your interview on @BBCgmu - I did my #welding course in the then Dungannon 'Tec, now @swccollege
@frackindisaster @moneillsf @Pontifex @M_McGuinness_SF @DUPleader good to have his support #NoFracking #Fermanagh #Leitrim #Tyrone #Sligo
@nampix @ShooterWol @photosSMH @NSWRFS in the winter? Is that unusual?
@AghalooOfficial comhghairdeas to the U-16's on the win this evening!
Between what's happening in #Gaza and what potentially could happen in #Fermanagh re #Fracking - it's been a tough few weeks. God bless xo
‚Äú@TVconormac: Found 2 cash filled purses on @Translink_NI 7.30pm 238 Belfast to Newry bus. Driver has them. Check Newry station.‚Äù Good man!
@NoFrackingNI @PhilFlanagan @mccleangreen @hughmccloy SF totally opposed to #fracking, can't ban without support of other parties.
@Rambunctious_Ro UVF F..k Gaza swastikas and references to Hitler's book.
Was down at St Patricks Church in Dungannon early this morning and saw the graffiti on the walls. Absolutely despicable hate crime.
‚Äú@CampaChormaic: @AghalooOfficial children proudly representing their club at Campa Chormaic! http://t.co/gKm9TNzaGu‚Äù great pic!
@danmc2 thanks Dan - was going to call you 'Dr Pop' but 'Dr Rhythm&Blues' might be more appropriate - did you go to the gig?
@Frack_Off Liam Magee raised this with me & @PhilFlanagan on Friday, I called HSE immediately while still on site & asked them to intervene
@hughmccloy @NoFrackingNI @crowsandjackdaw @PhilFlanagan I'm upset and angry about a lot of things, ie #Gaza, won't lose any sleep over you.
@hughmccloy @crowsandjackdaw @PhilFlanagan interesting that you continually have a go at us, not the energy minister who granted licences?
Caught up with Cllr Anthony McFeely, John Sheridan and Brendan Barry at the #NotoFracking protest in Belcoo last nite http://t.co/AZPm6mHhgO
@Uppo1963 it was Henry St Claire Frederick, also known as Taj Mahal, v cool guy!
@SiobhanMorris12 no, he kept me in craic the whole way home, and played the ukulele for me üé∏
Met this shy, retiring young fella on the plane, he's playing with Van Morrison this week, anyone know who he is? http://t.co/Zv2ARsRtvS
@GerryAdamsSF lots of people asking for you at today's #FreePalestine rally in London #StopKillingChildrenInGaza

@crowsandjackdaw Sinn F√©in's official (and unofficial) position is that we are unequivocally against fracking.
@CampaChormaic Eunan's having a great time lads, and this years jerseys are gorgeous! Go raibh maith agaibhüòé
@Sarge1972 @Donnchadhol they will, impressive statistics. However, if a northern team used those tactics the pundits would gutty them.
@owen_mulligan Clinker! "Somebody puts their finger in your mouth whaddya gonna do - blow it out?"
@McIlroyRory amazing performance, comhghairdeas! We're all delighted for you!
Woohoo @McIlroyRory - must be Thursday!

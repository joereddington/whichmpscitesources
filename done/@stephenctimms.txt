Why hasn’t @George_Osborne and the Treasury approved the full business case for Universal Credit? 
  http://t.co/0JijxVDgsA Thu Feb 19 11:19:35 GMT 2015
@borngeek @trm234567 @meulop The idea of Universal Credit is good.  It's implementation has been a shambles, just as we warned in 2010 Wed Feb 18 16:38:19 GMT 2015
@MarshDav5west @labourpress @edballsmp Yes - Job Guarantee will be for young people on JSA for a year and over 25s on JSA for two years Wed Feb 18 14:28:13 GMT 2015
@trm234567 Scale of problems facing Universal Credit all too real - in 2011 was to be complete by 2017, now by 2021 - and will slip further Wed Feb 18 14:26:49 GMT 2015
At this rate, full roll out of Universal Credit will take 1,605 years.  On the basis of last month's figures it was only 1571 years. Wed Feb 18 11:07:39 GMT 2015
New figures this morning show Universal Credit roll out has slowed. 31,030 now claiming - Ministers said there'd be a million by last April. Wed Feb 18 11:04:58 GMT 2015
Youth unemployment up on the quarter again.  Government's plan letting young people down - time for a better one Wed Feb 18 10:25:49 GMT 2015

@johnsouthwales @MidWalesMike @WOWpetition @robmcd85 That was key point from Future Jobs Fund - young people need the break of a proper job Sat Feb 14 10:14:22 GMT 2015
@johnsouthwales @MidWalesMike @WOWpetition @robmcd85 Guarantee is 25 hrs/wk. If job doesn't last after 6m, intensive job search help given Sat Feb 14 10:12:50 GMT 2015
@johnsouthwales @MidWalesMike @WOWpetition @robmcd85 Guarantees a properly paid job. On Work Programme, fewer than 1 in 3 get six months job Sat Feb 14 10:09:18 GMT 2015
@johnsouthwales Its surely always been the case that you are on unemployment benefit until you find a job. That's how Guarantee will work Sat Feb 14 10:07:55 GMT 2015
@MidWalesMike @KimberworthWill @RachelReevesMP People in work still entitled to housing benefit - only partly tapered away Sat Feb 14 10:02:47 GMT 2015
@CarbonisedPleb @MidWalesMike @RachelReevesMP @WOWpetition @LabourList New jobs emerging, but young & long term unemployed not getting them Sat Feb 14 10:00:02 GMT 2015
@leftferret @WOWpetition @Timewalkproject @MidWalesMike @RachelReevesMP @LabourList Huge amount. Step 1: scrap 'benefit offflow' measure Fri Feb 13 19:55:38 GMT 2015
@leftferret @Timewalkproject @MidWalesMike @WOWpetition @RachelReevesMP @LabourList Agreed! Fri Feb 13 19:54:09 GMT 2015
@robmcd85 Guarantee will be of proper paid job, at least 25 hours per week, with training. Same model as Future Jobs Fund, Jobs Growth Wales Fri Feb 13 17:42:47 GMT 2015
@Jules_Clarke @MidWalesMike @RachelReevesMP @WOWpetition @LabourList Agreed - like Future Jobs Fund and Jobs Growth Wales Fri Feb 13 17:40:28 GMT 2015
@MidWalesMike @RachelReevesMP @WOWpetition @LabourList Like Future Jobs Fund, Jobs Growth Wales.  Not workfare - ask anyone who was on them Fri Feb 13 17:39:38 GMT 2015
@MidWalesMike @RachelReevesMP @WOWpetition @LabourList It's a guarantee of a job with proper wage, at least 25 hours per week, with training Fri Feb 13 17:36:46 GMT 2015
@wit_xx @RachelReevesMP And a bigger population! Thu Feb 12 07:36:51 GMT 2015
@wit_xx @RachelReevesMP No, they are real jobs - just look at Jobs Growth Wales. Funded throughout next Parliament by two tax measures. Thu Feb 12 06:39:11 GMT 2015
@aimsetc Always been the case that people claiming JSA / unemployment benefit expected to take a job when offered. Why wouldn't you? Thu Feb 12 06:35:52 GMT 2015
@wit_xx @RachelReevesMP As with Future Jobs Fund, people trapped on benefits have the chance to flourish in work. They benefit, & we all do. Wed Feb 11 21:13:54 GMT 2015
@aimsetc Agreed! The current efforts to trip people up in order to sanction them are a disgrace Wed Feb 11 21:10:24 GMT 2015
@pmorris74 @RachelReevesMP @LabourList Yes!  As the Future Jobs Fund was Wed Feb 11 18:25:22 GMT 2015
@aimsetc No!  But those who can work should have the chance to Wed Feb 11 18:23:40 GMT 2015
@wit_xx @RachelReevesMP Employers won't be forced to do anything. Will have incentive to recruit someone they otherwise probably wouldn't Wed Feb 11 18:19:59 GMT 2015

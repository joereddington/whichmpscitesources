@Robbill123 It's precisely what I said - "youngest workers"! My job to point out bad news as well as acknowledge good.
@Robbill123 I spoke of positive trend. Why not acknowledge that - among 16-17 yr olds - unemployment over 12 m increased last month?
@Robbill123 Hope you now accept that long term unemployment among "the youngest workers" (you're correct that's the term I used) went up
@fastramdesign http://t.co/uxpAyBL8am
@Robbill123 I pointed out correctly that long term unemployment, over 12 months, among 16-17 year olds (I said "the very youngest") went up
@hx_06 I think I have. Today's figures show higher long term (12 months +) unemployment among 16-17 yr olds - the "very youngest", as I said
Office for National Statistics, 13 Aug: last time average increase in regular pay was lower than today's figure: "Never"
@hx_06 @CCHQPress @BBCNews I'm afraid it does. They may have some inexperienced people in today
Today's figures: rate of pay increases 0.6%, the lowest ever, in figures going back to 2001. But inflation up to 1.9%. Squeeze getting worse
@CCHQPress @BBCNews @UKLabour Glad you acknowledge long term unemployment among 16-17s (the very youngest, as I said) has gone up. Apology?
Overall fall in unemployment welcome. But employment rate also down on month. And long term unemployment (12 m +) up for 16-17s & over 50s.
@CCHQPress @BBCNews Long term unemployment (12 months +) among the very youngest (16-17) and over 50s is up. Apology please.

National Audit Office on Universal Credit: "a culture of 'good news' reporting that limited open discussion of risks and stifled challenge"
National Audit Office: "The source of many problems has been the absence of a detailed view of how Universal Credit is meant to work"

@paula0x0x0x0x0x But common view - now shown wrong: churches have declined & don't make a difference now. Food poverty still growing fast.
@amit_savilerow But note this depressing news report today: http://t.co/OkCNROG33w.
@amit_savilerow Because a judge upheld Paddy Power's appeal against Newham Council's refusal. The law must be changed.

@iamdaddykay @michaelpls91 Will he come to see me?
@IlyasAyub1 @newhamlondon I agree. We need change in law. At the moment, Council refuses permission, but judges overturn refusal on appeal.
@wrighty_14 Agree. Small businesses key. Too many schemes, poorly thought out, not properly marketed. It's confusing and too hard for firms.
@wrighty_14 see my blog post today on youth unemployment http://t.co/3FejEs2YfO
@bowlercass thank you for great visit today to impressive Jewish Care, Golders Green Road
15 k youth unemploym't rise reflects N Clegg's Youth Contract debacle. Target for wage incentives: help 160 k in 3 yrs.  Helped in yr 1: 4k.
Under employment at record levels. No. in pt time work because can't find full time is up on the quarter. Contributing to real wage fall.
Number out of work for over a year, 909,000, now highest since 1996. Where is that corner we are supposed to have turned?
Work Programme is to tackle long term unemployment. Today's rise in no. out of work over year, & over 2 years, reflects poor performance.
Long term unemployment continuing to rise.  Number out of work over 12 months up 7000 in today's figures, to 909,000. Will it reach million?
Average real wages down ¬£1500 since election.  Today's labour market statistics show wages up 0.6% in past year, but prices up 3.3%
@joyfactoryuk I love the business card!
Welcome 4000 fall in unemployment today. But wages up 0.6% when prices +3.3%; youth unemployment up 15,000; long term unemployment up 7000.
Youth unemployment up 15,000 today, edging back towards 1 m. Why is Government failing? What should be done instead? http://t.co/3FejEs2YfO

@SamSussex The overall pay cap should be used for larger increases for lower paid.  The benefit cap mostly affects people in low paid work.

@LouLancaster hard to see how DCMS can credibly lead on Internet regulation
@LouLancaster telecommunications policy transferred to a lightweight department
@LouLancaster  Presume would mean entire staff team shifting dept.  Structure making good decisions harder. V high price for Vince's gaffe.

Debating tax simplification on Newsnight this evening.
@riptari Very long grass.  They panned our 'universal 2 Mbit/s by 2012' target as unambitious - now they've delayed it to 2015!
@kenningtonkitty Glad to.
@riptari Market won't serve rural areas. Only funding now in prospect is new BBC licence settlement, 2013, but Gov wants to cut licence fee.
Tories derided Labour's broadband universal service pledge as unambitious.  Now they say they will deliver it, but three years later!
@riptari How can Government justify delay until 2013 in providing funding for next gen broadband in hard to reach areas?
Coalition policy on next generation broadband appears wholly vacuous: grandiose rhetoric but no substance - and no funding.

Just weeks after PM signs #climate pledge highlighting economic threat, not one mention of climate or carbon from Osborne #fail #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 14:19:40 GMT 2015
With cuts hitting poorest & with need to avoid climate crisis, handing out huge tax breaks to oil & gas multinationals deeply irresponsible Wed Mar 18 14:18:41 GMT 2015
If Osborne seriously supported "latest insurgent industries" he'd highlight cleantech renewables & storage as well as orchestras #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 14:08:11 GMT 2015
On top of legislating for £21bn of welfare cuts a year, Osborne proud to annouce hitting poorest hardest with 12bn more cuts #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:51:13 GMT 2015
Eye-watering tax breaks for oil & gas companies.Climate vandalism from Chancellor just weeks after cross-party #climate pledge #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:30:11 GMT 2015
Roads spending again. More environmental & economic illiteracy from short-term Chancellor: http://t.co/JAx0ZOLJxK #Budget2015 #airpollution Wed Mar 18 13:28:20 GMT 2015
Glad Chancellor has backed my calls for extenstion to small business rate relief #Budget2015 #Brighton Wed Mar 18 13:24:08 GMT 2015
wifi in libraries welcome but cuts to local govt budgets means many libraries shutting #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:23:26 GMT 2015
Poverty wages mean people in work need housing benefit. No. of in-work claimants up 68% this parl to over 1m ppl #Budget2015 #livingwage Wed Mar 18 13:11:00 GMT 2015
Osborne talks about "sacrifices of British people" but poorest have paid dearest #NotAllInItTogether #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:04:59 GMT 2015
sun is shining & govt fixing roof apparently - but HMT still refusing to let schools borrow to install solar PV & cut bills #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 12:58:41 GMT 2015
Chancellor out of touch on living standards - enormous cost of housing crippling, cuts to local govt funding hitting vulnerable #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 12:51:37 GMT 2015
Chancellor says supports the home buyer but does not address fact wages & house prices massively out of synch #homesforbritain #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 12:50:32 GMT 2015

@CelticChuck67 @NiallSF ouch :-) ouch :-) ouch :-)

@NiallSF what was the score?
Poor performance Celtic. Fans would have deserved a win but the team definitely did not.

Delighted that a long term truce has been brokered for Gaza. The borders need to be opened now and the aid and world needs to be allowed in.

Principle 2: We must build our science base - our store of knowledge and wisdom.
Principle 1: Financial sustainability - good research and good teaching, needs good and sure foundations.

@iankatz1000 somehow you missed any discussion of Mr Gove's disastrous reform of teacher training & damage to supply of new physics teachers
And that's why last why last year's fall in new physics teachers is disastrous news: yet what has Mr Willetts done to stop Michael Gove?
I think nearly half of state schools fail to inspire girls to take A level physics...hence the need for inspiring physics teachers...
I hope David Willetts attacks Michael Gove's disastrous reforms of teacher training that's produced a FALL in new, trained physics teachers

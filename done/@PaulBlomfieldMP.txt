Those figures are from the 'Hard Facts to Swallow' report which looks at Arts Council investment plans 2015-18: http://t.co/FB4gQWcsff 2/2
Over the next 3 years London is set to receive £81.87 Arts Council funding per head, whilst the rest of England is getting just £19.80 1/2
The Government must call time on our London-centric arts funding model. The huge imbalance is unfair & getting worse https://t.co/veyDK2tNNO

@a_wardrope 140 characters isn't enough for a full reply. Drop me an email and I can send a longer reply.
@a_wardrope I think fracking is a distraction from the real debate we need on energy which is about how we cut carbon emissions and fast.

Shocking that Green Councillors @SJ4Central and @RobMurphy2012 happy to see UKIP take control of our police. Out of touch with your voters.
We'll scrap PCCs if elected next year @SheffCityNigel
Unforgivable that you'd be happy to see UKIP take control of our police @RobMurphy2012  Lots of your Green voters disagreed with you today!
Great to be joined by @ChriswMP campaigning for @AlanBillingsPCC. 4 hrs left to vote to stop UKIP taking over police http://t.co/ASpUm7LJ0i

@lisasevern Agree, Labour will abolish PCCs if we're elected but they're here for 2 years and I don't want UKIP taking charge of our police.
Shocking that @nick_clegg says he's not using his vote in the PCC election. I'm pleased most Lib Dems are ignoring him & voting to stop UKIP
I'm appalled by the attitudes of  UKIP's candidate and the racist content he's posted online http://t.co/LzqkT6IdiL Use your vote today.
UKIP's divisive politics would turn communities against each other. Join me in using your vote to stop them taking control of our police.
Labour would abolish the Police Commissioner post if we're elected, but it’s here for 2 years and there’s a real risk UKIP could win it.
Vote for @AlanBillingsPCC today. We need a Police Commissioner to bring S.Yorks together to tackle issues facing the police, not divide us.
Shocking that @nick_clegg not using vote in PCC election. Pleased most Lib Dems ignoring him and voting to stop UKIP http://t.co/qukJVsgrV7

Low pay and insecurity. My views on the reality behind the latest jobs figures in today's @SheffieldStar http://t.co/ir3eNdVMN2
The impact assessment would show outsourcing jobs leads to lost skills, less taxes & more out-of-work benefits. Not so good or popular. 3/3
Meanwhile Maude’s been caught praising 80,000 civil service job losses as “good” and “popular”. http://t.co/RGvh7hlmfl. Unbelievable 2/3
Francis Maude is outsourcing DWP jobs from Sheffield to India and is refusing to publish the impact assessment http://t.co/ZrkBAQSvh1 1/3

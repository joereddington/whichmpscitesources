@BBCPolitics Did #Marr ask the PM about the Mark Reckless accusation that he has added more to the debt in 4 years than Labour did in 13?
@KaalGroup The so called polling experts chase 200k voters in a few dozen marginals while 16Million didn't vote in 2010 - Time to engage!
Nice to see Andrew Marr make an appearance on the Sunday morning #Farage show @BBCPolitics
@gunrgraham @lawrence0521 And the nature of modern employment practice involves a contract of employment for all employees?
@Lee5_1Johnson Under AP the Championship looks like the only escape route.
@Uniteanation Would agree except one aspect The jobs weren't "lost" The jobs, the people, their experience and skills were discarded!
@lawrence0521 @SilverTyne @NHAparty Might be a Company Directors legal duty - but an employee???
@grantshapps Did anyone catch Mark R at UKIP conf mention how Osborne has added more to the nations debt in 4 years than Labour did in 13?
I gather that when asked why it had taken him so long to defect from the Tory Party the ex Tory MP replied - Have you seen the queue!
@paullewismoney Again agreed but current Council tax system is undoubtedly regressive - income and ability to pay largely ignored.
@NUFCTheMag The result and performance at Southampton was entirely predictable I'm sad to say I predicted a 4-0 reverse and it happened!
@paullewismoney If you are arguing for a complete review of the post poll tax banding system then I am with you 100%
@paullewismoney But one of the problems with Council tax banding is that Band H is for homes that are from £320k upwards to sky is the limit

@Hepworthclare @nick_forbes To some it was the Newcastle Newcastle attitude that led to Tees valley going it alone within the N East.
@LouiseMensch @HouseofTwits That would be Prerogative
@nick_forbes @Hepworthclare Correct Nick But it isn't just about Newcastle - whole of North east has a stake and needs to work together!

@RobHSafc @MsiDouglas I was one of those siren voices too when the Wembley deal was unveiled But clearly if attendances plummet who knows?

a problem faced by ordinary people that was ever solved by

#OnlyAsking
@HannahDavid_HW @HouseofTwits And in the mean time 
#Osbornomics have hardly touched the deficit and doubled the debt in
only 4 years!
@Markwatson33 In that case why do almost 50,000 turn out to watch 
Alan Pardew's Newcastle United?
@Markwatson33 If Wembley continues to attract low attendances it 
would certainly give a rationale for trying to renegotiate!
@Markwatson33 You might not want to see England occasionally at 
St James' Park or the Stadium of Light but 
there many that would want to.
@GatesheadAlan Of course went to see England v Turkey there!
@toontoon999 It is an unfortunate position but would be reviewed if 
low attendances continue Not in the interest of the game or its fans!
@toontoon999 Could 70,000 at Old Trafford or 52,000 at St James' 
Park not pay off more debt than 40,000 at Wembley? #OnlyAsking
@Redpeter99 Who was it that carried the idea of fixed 
5 Year Parliaments into legislation?
@LabourEoin Interesting question - what is "the realm of politics" ?
@toontoon999 @MsiDouglas But does everything have to be there 
particularly in situations when it is not a neutral venue for 
both teams.
@toontoon999 @MsiDouglas Indeed deal was done years ago - it was 
wrong then and is still wrong now England extends beyond London!
@toontoon999 @MsiDouglas How low would Wembley crowds have to 
get to before it was seriously considered. Empty seats don't pay debts!
@nick_styls You can have Alan Pardew!
England manager suggests a lot more games in half empty Wembley.
Scrap the contract and take games back to Manchester Newcastle etc.

@RWilkes1 @annaturley @IPPR Funny though that Bus companies find it v difficult to come to a public service consensus without regulation?
@annaturley @kevpeel @tomcopley @CalumSPlath Are Leeds Manchester in "The North" ? ;-)

@CalumSPlath @tomcopley @annaturley Over 20 years ago was possible to go Newcastle to KGX in 2:38 via @eastcoastuk predecessor GNER
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR Despite previous promises D of Transport as announced Pacer trains to remain in North East for another decade!
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR Again agree but conversely choking the regions equally doesn't help Londoners - leads to Jobs population drift!
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR Yes strange that the only place in England that has "regional govenance" is London.
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR And an understanding that future plans need to reflect decades of underinvestment in regions like North East!
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR Then we need to get London centred policy makers in Dept of Transport to look seriously at need elsewhere!
@tomcopley @annaturley @IPPR Agree but that is how it has worked for decades with huge investment differentials in favour of London.
@eriicaaaaaaa Indeed!
@annaturley @IPPRNorth Ministers want to fine those who hog middle lane on Motorways - Chance would be a fine thing in NE England!
@LiamRCarr Have had recent experience of the Tyne Valley Shuggy Boat but @northernrailorg have no planned investment in this control period!
@annaturley @IPPR A case may be made to favour London for transport investment maybe 5 times more per head. But 500 times more than N East??
@annaturley @IPPR £15Billion on London Crossrail with Crossrail 2 being seriously considered, while we are to get refurbished pacer trains?
@annaturley @IPPR Network Rail and Northern Rail have nothing in their 5 year control period investment plan North of York ....
@annaturley @IPPR Couldn't agree more but the Metropolitan political elites have continued investment and policy regime that favour London.
@annaturley @IPPR Sad that we have known this a long time But London continues to be favoured in Transport policy over everywhere else!

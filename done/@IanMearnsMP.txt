@Hifistud Not responsible for that one! Sun Apr 26 23:06:45 BST 2015
@Hifistud They have rent control in many places it just has to be administered fairly. Unfettered market just adds to Hsg Benefit Bill. Sun Apr 26 23:05:21 BST 2015
@Hifistud But if you have discount built up it in other Council property it the discount makes building unaffordable under current rules. Sun Apr 26 23:03:23 BST 2015
@Hifistud I am totally in favour of a mass programme of Council House Building but we have to make the sums work! Sun Apr 26 23:01:32 BST 2015
@Hifistud One way to sort it is a 20 moratorium on sale of newly built Council Houses - that would work! Sun Apr 26 22:59:19 BST 2015

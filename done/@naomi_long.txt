@NeroBealFeirste @PaulTyredagh81 The Tories are not going to give us more money for welfare than they spend on their own electorate.
.@teaandmusings @agentathcliath @FleggerMcFleg Why would I pack my bags in East Belfast? I must be catching a flight back to Westminster. ;)
@ElaineMcCosh @allianceparty Has an impact on older customers & general footfall. Last bank in village, but ATM may be retained at least.
@NeroBealFeirste @PaulTyredagh81 It is excepted: ie. it doesn't impact on Barnett and NI finances.  Welfare and breaking parity do.
@NeroBealFeirste @PaulTyredagh81 Because welfare reform is about maintaining parity to protect NI Budget. Defence is an excepted matter.
@NeroBealFeirste @PaulTyredagh81 I opposed action in Syria but supported limited air strikes in Northern Iraq. I also opposed welfare reform
@alcham49 @Olive1309 If the legislation passes it will be binding.
Glad the #NHS Private Member's Bill passed in the House of Commons, addressing the impact of #TTIP.  #SaveTheNHS
@Daddiesmilk @peoplesNHSni I'm alreading achieving a lot with my Alliance colleagues in Nothern Ireland. :)
@PeteWishart That's very harsh.  On John Major.
@WillJanice @markdurkan is also here today.  None of the others are at this stage.
Here to vote on the Private Member's Bill to protect the #NHS from further privatisation and #TTIP.  #SaveTheNHS
@robojazz In the Commons already and will be voting to support him today.  #SaveTheNHS
@34marko @chrislove1 Bit of an update.  I managed to get my appointment moved so will be able to be at the NHS vote tomorrow.
@Olive1309 Just a bit of an update.  I managed to get my appointment moved so will be able to be at the NHS vote tomorrow.
@yvonnemcq I will be, yes.
@BCGCBelfast Massive congratulations!!! So well deserved.
@purplekezza Hope it goes well.
@AlexKane221b @PeterOsborne_ @MarkCarruthers7 @StepWalkTV @bbctheview Genius!
@purplekezza I will be, yes.
@PeterOsborne_ @MarkCarruthers7 @StepWalkTV @bbctheview Definitely, over-egging it.  Lol.  Right.  I'm done.
@PeterOsborne_ @MarkCarruthers7 @StepWalkTV @bbctheview Thanks, Peter.  You've taken the bad look off me. :D
@MarkCarruthers7 @StepWalkTV @bbctheview I'm sure I could have come up with something egg-cellent if I'd really tried.....   *groan*
@MarkCarruthers7 @StepWalkTV @bbctheview  Some people's careers might be toast if we did....ba-doom-tish.  Sorry, that was terrible. :)
Debate on West Lothian question, Barnett Formula and further regional devolution post #indyref underway in chamber.  Surprised no DUP here.
Also, great meeting with @LeagueNI Westminster colleagues to discuss hunting ban, badger baiting, dog fighting and snaring in GB and NI
Meeting this morning with @AnimalDefenders, to support campaign for CCTV in slaughterhouses.
Attending debate on Money Creation & Society: 1st time debated in almost 200 years. Important given the rise in digital banking and finance.
@teaandmusings @thejiffster It would be a brave party with a lot to hide that would try to block any proper investigation.

@warrensmyth I'm intending to be there, though time constraints mean I may not have a chance to speak.
@SPENCE_JOHN @AlexKane221b I don't agree that the point they made is unsubstantiated.  Their position on hunting is clear.
@SPENCE_JOHN @AlexKane221b No, I'm not. Those who work in animal protection are aware of the tactics which are described.
@SPENCE_JOHN @AlexKane221b So now they did mention it in the article? Glad we cleared that up.
@thedissenter @AlexKane221b Legal hunting often used to cover illegal activity, eg badger baiters carrying fox carcasses as cover if stopped
@thedissenter @AlexKane221b DOJ, DARD & DOE, plus PSNI & judiciary, depending on context. DOJ made changes for review of light sentencing.
@SPENCE_JOHN @AlexKane221b They specifically mention hunting with dogs and support for a ban. See what you want to see indeed.
@SPENCE_JOHN @AlexKane221b Read the article.
@thedissenter @AlexKane221b Read the article.
Appalling brutality and yet another good reason to ban hunting with hounds which is used as cover for this activity. http://t.co/7tYFPItfFK

The CSA Inquiry needs a chair who can command the respect & confidence of victims. Another false start will further undermine the Inquiry.
@ianjamesparsley They abstained.
@PoliticalTwitNI @ianjamesparsley Because it was better than the last attempt but still failed to deal with strategic issues.
@ianjamesparsley Nope. It's pure party politicking.

@PurpleStandard @belfaststephen @FGAU1912 @allianceparty Condemnation was tweeted and I raised the recent violence in Parliament yesterday.
@PurpleStandard @belfaststephen @FGAU1912 @allianceparty Which residents?  Erm....the ones who live around the office? 1/2
@PurpleStandard @belfaststephen @FGAU1912 @allianceparty "the work they are doing to protect residents": do you even read before tweeting?
@Jan_Michael03 @allianceparty Area cleared after 2am. Thankfully, the device was a hoax by ATOs. Back to business as usual.
@belfastbarman @allianceparty I've to catch the red eye tomorrow morning, so I'll stick with Diet Coke.  For now anyway.  :)
@andysimpy @UTVLiveTonight @allianceparty @PoliceServiceNI They won't. It's not about us - it's about upholding democracy against mob rule.
@belfastbarman @allianceparty Not at this point.
@CllrYvonneBoyle @allianceparty Thanks, Yvonne.
@kayzo68 @allianceparty I'm in Westminster for NI Affairs Select Committee and NI Questions today and am flying home tomorrow.
@FergalMcFerran @allianceparty Thank you.  Appreciate the support.
@kayzo68 @allianceparty I can't direct the press but I have spoken out and condemned the violence including the attack on Jordan.
@alcham49 @teaandmusings @SianAlliance @allianceparty Thanks Alan
@kayzo68 @allianceparty Nonsense.  I raised the attack on Jordan at NI Questions in Parliament.  Try doing some research.
@kayzo68 @allianceparty We did. Check our statements.
@belfastbarman @allianceparty Suspect device found after bomb warning phoned to Samaritans.
@Deegtd @john_loughran @kmgwm Phoned through bomb warning to Samaritans. Similar call on Monday was hoax. This time suspicious object found.
@andysimpy @UTVLiveTonight @allianceparty We are. Very grateful to @PoliceServiceNI for the work they are doing to protect residents.
@john_loughran Thanks. Appreciate the support.
@UTVLiveTonight @allianceparty Second alert since Monday.  Suspect device being dealt with by ATO after call to Samaritans.
@SianAlliance @allianceparty Suspected pipe bomb being dealt with by ATO after bomb warning to Samaritans. Second alert at office this week.

@samlocktight @RationalPanic @Wasthatmee  You're all certifiable.  You do know this, right?
@CDMStalfordDUP @purple_kathryn @RationalPanic @dawnpurvis You've repeated this smear frequently. Do you accept it is unfounded?
@CDMStalfordDUP @purple_kathryn @RationalPanic  About Alliance using paramilitaries to canvass or about @dawnpurvis canvassing for me?
@JarrieSam I'm not and neither are most Christians I know.

@CDMStalfordDUP @Theysaythat "With talk of".  There was talk. From DUP.  But Jim wasn't foolish enough to make the allegation or name names.
@CDMStalfordDUP @Theysaythat Just to clarify are you saying I had the PUP leader canvass & that they were a paramilitary? Quite important.
@Seamus_Close Sadly, that may be the case but it won't be for want of effort on my part. The victims deserve better than currently on offer.
@CDMStalfordDUP @Theysaythat No, I didn't.

@Theysaythat @CDMStalfordDUP No. It isn't and it never has been.

First of three NI focused debates today underway on the operations of the National Crime Agency in Northern Ireland
@NISNTAC I am hoping to review the information in these cases later in the week, to see if any action is possible.
@danbyrne2000 @PaulClark_UTV Stormont inquiry cannot fully deal with allegations of intelligence service cover up/ Off Secrets Act.
@shiftcontrol66 Already reflected in unanimous support of Assembly for inclusion in this inquiry.  They are simply hiding from the issue.
@belfastbarman @JohnMcCallister It is discussed. We've proposed full reform & also temp change to limit strictly when POCs can be used.
@SherdyMe @allianceparty @agentathcliath Full support - my colleagues proposed Assembly Motion. No authority over intelligence services, tho
There are many unanswered questions re  Kincora scandal, the latest being what exactly Govt are trying to hide. http://t.co/Qlj90Tqz8c
@NIIRTA @HouseofCommons Good to catch up and discuss how we can make Northern Ireland more successful.
.@john_loughran That caveat of 'where possible' ought to be a cause for real concern.  Suggests something less than full disclosure.
@hearmeout69 @JohnMcCallister @belfastbarman On this and other occasions we did. :)
@JohnMcCallister @belfastbarman You did well to avoid a petition of concern.  It would appear there's been a nasty outbreak of them today...
@ian_pace @MySweetLandlord I will, yes. Some positives in NI SoS statement, but not the full and transparent inquiry required.
@MySweetLandlord And I have not received a reply from the Home Office or from Fiona Wolff. But I do have an adjournment debate tomorrow.....
@MySweetLandlord I have and it misses the key point.  Children's issues are devolved: the intelligence services accused of cover up are not.
@NeroBealFeirste I didn't vote for the cuts so no contradiction.
@NeroBealFeirste I voted against welfare cuts at every stage.  But don't let facts get in the way of your argument.

@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview There's difference between inequality of outcome & discrimination. Affirmative action works
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview I'm saying our process is merit based. If you allege otherwise, where is your evidence?
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview I am not denying there is sexism: that's why we review processes all the time. 1/2
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview That lack of applicants is what we're working to address.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview Can't speak for other parties. Alliance imbalance due to fewer applicants not bias.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview Only if hakf the applicants are women which they aren't. Affirmative action can address that
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview System in Alliance works for women & is constantly reviewed. Focus is on encouraging more.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview Merit does the opposite of protecting privilege.  I had no political links or privilege.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview System is open. I've encouraged/supported women from all backgrounds to stand as have others
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview 2/2  That's why we are focused on encouraging more women rather than changing the process.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview 1/2  Same true within Alliance. Female applicants have higher success in getting selected.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview 2. She still had to go through a competitive process to get selected to stand based on merit
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview 1. Absolutely encouraged her & many other women I know to stand.  That's affirmative action.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview No evidence of gatekeeping in Alliance: evidence need to encourage more to come forward
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview Again, the public chose on a range of issues, but Alliance selects candidates on merit.
@CeartanamBan @gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview The merit principle absolutely applies to selection within parties: the public then chose.
@GallahersBlues @The_Firemen @bbctheview I think to attract them, we need a more functional Assembly that's actually delivering real change
@gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview I've always worked in predominantly male careers & had mostly good experiences. Message needs to be heard
@gaygael @The_Firemen @bbctheview No. Affirmative action is fine, but so-called 'positive discrimination' breaches the merit principle
@The_Firemen @bbctheview To get more women in politics? To increase their visibility? Absolutely. It's critical if we're to represent well.
@The_Firemen @bbctheview Can request a person or general party rep. Depends,  but we only have 3 women at MP/MLA level. That's the issue.
@ihiccupalot @robertmurtagh1 @bbctheview @ordinarysjp Well, I'm a Christian and a feminist so I'm not sure that holds true. :)
@The_Firemen @bbctheview @ordinarysjp We have offered other women on occasion and they haven't been accepted.
@ihiccupalot @bbctheview @ordinarysjp It actually starting to deliver like it should would encourage more people to engage, including women.
@bbctheview @ordinarysjp I was offered for the programme, in fairness.  And last night on Nolan, there were 3 women and 1 man.
@bbctheview @deirdreheenan @ordinarysjp No. Not in the slightest.
So sorry to hear of Shiela McQuaid's passing.  A real lady, a great Councillor and a committed Alliance activist. http://t.co/JLQvpdCG0V
@mairiac31 @RationalPanic You are courageous and did the right thing.  You've spoken out for other victims
@andrewmharding @SpotlightNI Absolutely.  Maíria is an extremely courageous woman.  The situation is cause for despair, but she gives hope.
@RationalPanic She is an amazingly courageous woman.  I've met with her a number of times and I am so impressed by her bravery #SpotLightNI
Covering up sex abuse is wrong regardless of whether state or paramilitaries involved.  Such allegations need investigated. #SpotLightNI
@TrevorLunnLV @JudithCochrane I can't see it in London.  Cheer them on for me. :)
@tomthehatchet Sadly I can't in London.  :D
The opening moments of #BBCApprentice make me despair for humanity.
@teaandmusings @LeagueNI I've stuck with it so far. I was vegetarian for about 6 mths before, which is probably more realistic.
@FightingMicrobe No, it shows commitment to a two state solution.
@ianjamesparsley And all the other parties with one or more MPs.  :)
@conlig2 The issue of human rights abuses in those states is something I raise regularly but we're clearly not going to agree about the vote
@CDMStalfordDUP @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson @allianceparty @SteveDonnan And who pays for the massive hole in the budget?
@conlig2 I'm aware of concerns, many of which I share; however, I feel the limited action of UK was the only option. What's your solution?
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ If your constituents paid charges, would you give money to others to avoid paying?
@roddecks @stewartcdickson @john63fields @Cut_the_Crap__ @Chris_Lyttle They can in some cases and do.
@roddecks @stewartcdickson @john63fields @Cut_the_Crap__ @Chris_Lyttle Showers more efficient than baths, so no. About unnecessary use/waste
@roddecks @stewartcdickson @john63fields @Cut_the_Crap__ @Chris_Lyttle Not how water bills work across GB, but usage part of charge.
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @cut_the_crap No other party would engage. Westminster got off the hook. Say everywhere else pays.
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @cut_the_crap We argued for capital investment from Westminster plus charges seven years ago.
@roddecks @stewartcdickson @john63fields @Cut_the_Crap__ @Chris_Lyttle Rates will escalate if we end up with EU infractions for pollution.
@roddecks @stewartcdickson @john63fields @Cut_the_Crap__ @Chris_Lyttle If you use less, you pay less. Can control your use.
@john63fields @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson Won't happen now. We pay less per home than their constituents. No will to help us.
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ We've supported reform to reduce elected reos nos. Still not enough to fill the gap
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__  All from same pot. If spent on division, less for water, hospitals, education.
@john63fields @stewartcdickson @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @allianceparty It's been out there since 2007.  About how not how much you pay.
@john63fields @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson It's not working. Lack priority of funding/access to loans to invest in network.
@john63fields @roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson @allianceparty Why? You're paying now. We want equiv. reduction in rates.
@roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson @allianceparty No. We've argued for an equivalent reduction in rates.
@roddecks @Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson @allianceparty Our policy is payment linked to water consumption with low income protection
@Cut_the_Crap__ @stewartcdickson @allianceparty Not an additional charge, a separate charge with reduction in regional rate.
@pandbbookshop No problem.  Sadly I'll be travelling at the time but hopefully I can assist with the campaign.
@alfamale128 @OurWeeParty I know - I have been pointless twice.  Compared to most politicians, that's not bad. Lol
@OurWeeParty One of the better ways I have been pointless, I guess. :D

@ollieandrex @thebuav We've also had first custodial sentences for animal cruelty in NI this week, something for which I've been campaigning
@thebuav Half way through the challenge now and it's been going well.  I've been spurred on by the promise of a vegan chocolate cake reward!
@SianAlliance @scott_jamison @EmmetMcDB @dickc If Scott stops following me I'm closing the account and just pretending to tweet. :)
@AmnestyNI No reply from Home Secretary to my letters over the same period either @KeithVazMP  Hope that @BBCSpotlight adds weight to calls.
@pauldelaney2012 @BBCSpotlight Not sure who did at that time.
Kincora scandal must be included in #CSAinquiry and tonight's @BBCSpotlight provides new reasons why.  Alleged cover up compounded abuse.
@belfastbarman @TrevorLunnLV @Lingo_sue_23 @allianceparty Were 2 men sentenced, one for cruelty & one for perverting the course of justice.
@PsTeddiebear I agree, bit am relieved a custodial sentence was given at all.  Step in the right direction. Too many walk free for similar.
@Lingo_sue_23 @allianceparty This is first custodial sentence for NI animal cruelty. Not the maximum, but a step in the right direction.
@david__123 No sentence would be enough. I just hope that the fact this time there is a custodial sentence may mark a change in the courts.
@ManUtdV I agree it is; however, given previous similar cases, I am please that finally a custodial sentence for animal cruelty was given.
http://t.co/Mba9jiCO8X  Hopefully with this news, lenient sentencing in animal cruelty cases is now a thing of the past.
@The_Firemen Happy to do so.  I'll have a chat with @EmmetMcDB tomorrow and see what we can do.
@MorpheusNI Yes. I agree and opposed it. Point is, they are still intent on more and deeper cuts regardless. They'll not make an exception.
@MorpheusNI Fraud is a tiny part of welfare budget & most people on benefits are in work. New jobs being created but still budget hole.
@MorpheusNI No. We would actually need more money as we don't raise revenue here to cover the difference in spending people want.
@MorpheusNI The figures quoted are at either end of the spectrum of works. Govt IT rarely comes in on budget so £400m is on the low side.
@MorpheusNI Yes. They've done it in England and Wales where they actually have an electorate to worry about.
@MorpheusNI Technically devolved, so requires legislation, but to cover welfare and pensions bill we need to maintain parity.
@MorpheusNI In Westminster all NI parties who attend opposed. Split is between those who think Tories will give NI more & those who don't.
@MorpheusNI We have no option. We have to live within the block grant set by the Tories. Problem is no-one willing to face that reality.
@MorpheusNI The estimate for NI is between £400M and £1Bn, latter allowing for replacement of old system, former for interim maintenance
@MorpheusNI Welfare just part of problem. Also long-term mismanagement of finances. Longer refuse to discuss, more blunt/sudden cuts will be
@MorpheusNI None. We have shown a united front opposing cuts; however, if they allow us to break our budget, Scotland & Wales will follow.
@MorpheusNI Not arguing they're a good thing but we don't have the option to raise much revenue and the block grant is what it is.
@MorpheusNI The cuts are about living within devolved budget & avoiding financial penalties for not doing so. I opposed them at Westminster.
@MorpheusNI SF/SDLP will block Bill so hasn't been moved as wouldn't pass. Trying to get agreement first.
@BBCgmu And BMAP expires next year! Focus should be on replacement to ensure proper framework for infrastructure & land-use planning.
@MorpheusNI @allianceparty Only option is to identify priorities for Exec, not each Dept & target funds to protect those affect by WR.
@MorpheusNI @allianceparty We can't try to mitigate and manage the effects while some parties won't address the issue at all.
@shor_ufc I will be, yes.
@badgersni @wildlife_uk @GWalker9 Brilliant photos.
Heading to @RadioDowntown to talk to @SiobhanMcGarry about a number of interesting and quirky topics, be sure to tune in.
@Kalista63 @demindblower @BBCNolan No, we don't. Fought against them but if we don't deal with reality, vulnerable people will be worse off.
@baghcat @allianceparty I'm not on my knees, just dealing with reality. We're not a sovereign state. Have a budget & have to live within it.
@baghcat @allianceparty Never said it was foregone, if parties willing to face political & financial crisis. Little evidence that they are.
@baghcat @allianceparty Exec can use remaining budget to better protect vulnerable than any direct rule Tory govt will. Lesser of two evils.
@Cut_the_Crap__ @allianceparty No. We can direct money we do have to protect vulnerable people & services as best we can.  The Tories won't.
@baghcat @allianceparty So, collapse the Exec & leave the poor & vulnerable to the mercy of Tories who started the cuts? How does that help?
@jk188826 I grew up on benefits under Tories. Pretty sure better to try to protect the vulnerable via devolution than leaving it to Tories.
@Cut_the_Crap__ @allianceparty Where's extra cash coming from?Tories cut welfare so respond by handing them control of everything else, too?
@robert_mcmillen @allianceparty Some exemptions including from bedroom tax. Regardless, have to live with the budget or Exec falls.
@pandbbookshop No problem.  Hope the meeting goes well.
@scott_jamison @StephenNolan There'll be no pulling required.  I'll be out the door like shot. :D
@NIYF You have my support.
@ManUtdV @allianceparty These ones?  http://t.co/t06k6pu0fw
@MySweetLandlord She wouldn't have had the opportunity to do as yet.
@StepWalkTV And there's another Christmas deadline, too.  It's like Groundhog Day.  I'll stock up on Ferrero Rocher. :)
@matthewcarson @SteveDonnan You two behave and improve your grammar and spelling or feel my wrath...lol
@matthewcarson @SteveDonnan Such lies!
@belfastbarman @barrabest Fabulous photo.
@teaandmusings I've always used it, but have been doing so more directly since last January.  New Year's resolutions can last... :)
@conlig2 None, if we were acting unilaterally.  But with the support of Iraqi military on the ground, limited airstrikes can play a role.
@conlig2 Of course. That's why being asked by Iraq & having support of others in region is crucial. Also why I voted no to action in Syria.
@conlig2 I did not say that. To be legal military intervention must be the last resort. In Israel, other means have not yet been exhausted.
@conlig2 I don't believe that the avtion agreed yesterday will compound the problem: neither do I believe that it alone can solve it.
@christophersla1 It was a tough decision. I believe military action must always be the last resort and is never the whole solution.
@conlig2 No, because not all diplomatic options have been exhausted. ISIL are not a democratic govt or a group which can be reasoned with.
@conlig2 Carnage & genocide which ISIL are visiting on civilians isn't pretty either. Limited action to support Iraqi Govt may help end it.
@christophersla1 Not at all.  Voted with a heavy heart. However this time, I believe the conditions for limited intervention have been met.
@Ryan__92 @allianceparty I'm not comfortable with arming anyone in the region given the volatility.  That was not part of today's vote.
@rickblackdog @allianceparty Which is why it cannot be only about air strikes. Need a wider long-term strategy.
@OurWeeParty @DavidFordMLA @allianceparty Should I feel worried?.....
@teaandmusings @DavidFordMLA Yes, I've only had my account for years. :)
@rickblackdog @allianceparty Not supporting the democratic govt in Iraq risks further genocide. No easy choices in the context.
@christophersla Opposed action in Syria but democratic govt in Iraq have asked for help to end genocide. No good solutions in this context.
@Ryan__92 @allianceparty The UK is already in the Middle East. The misjudged Iraq war and the ISIL fighters from the UK are evidence.
@bbctheview lol!  @purdypols @martis always ahead of the game.  Even outsmarts BA flight delays. :)

@badgersni @domdyer70 @UlsterWildlife @GWalker9 @DrBrianMay Well done and keep up the good work against animal cruelty.
@ChrisFixersNI @Chris_Lyttle Perfect.  Speak soon.
@ChrisFixersNI @Chris_Lyttle Absolutely.   I can think of quite a few.  #talentedyouth
@SMcC_TheDetail Makes a change from raging at badgers for moving goal posts, I suppose.
@peadarmor @allianceparty It did.  But now they've won, they may well deliver Devo Max, but new money is less likely.
@Ruger38special @allianceparty No vote always pointed to reform of UK. NI needs strong leadership to avoid being disadvantaged in process.
@peadarmor @allianceparty We opposed welfare cuts in Westminster; however, I doubt that the Government will reverse the process.
Visit to NSPCC's Young Witness Service was very impressive yesterday.  Some thoughts on the service:   http://t.co/f4FcsJIlII

@J0hnB0yC Thanks for the link.
@BettyDoesBangor Like I say, you don't have to like or agree with someone to have empathy for their loss.
@BettyDoesBangor One can disagree profoundly, as I did with Ian Paisley, and still feel sympathy and compassion for a grieving family.
Sad to hear of the death of Ian Paisley. May God's love & grace surround & support Eileen and the family at this painful time.

@royfis Serious allegations which @Chris_Lyttle will pursue as Vice Chair of OFMDFM Ctte. People's grief & pain should not be politicised.

Interview with @taramillstv on @BBCNewsNI regarding Bombardier redundancies.  BBC Newsline 10_9.mp4
@purplekezza @OfficialPCA Will do my best. Have been working on this for a while and will continue to do so. Happy to keep in contact.
Arrived for interview regarding job losses at Bombardier on @bbcnewsline
It would appear that in Owen Paterson MP we had one of the least curious Northern Ireland Secretary's of State of all time.  #OTRS
@phildowie I don't have figures for total DETI or INI investment to hand or the split between jobs/infrastructure.
@phildowie No penalties in relation to job losses as they are not a new FDI withdrawing from NI but continue to invest eg. new apprentices.
@phildowie Issue is global restructuring. Total workforce still higher after these losses than 2009, though no comfort to those affected.
@Michael_MXP DEL are doing that, but we remain strong in aerospace. Bad news today but significant investment still there for long-term.
@purplekezza How so?  I was in the debare throughout and spoke briefly?  Were you in the gallery?

@nornirongunner I have voted against consistently and will continue to do support the scrapping of the bedroom tax when bill returns.
@nornirongunner Late notice of vote and unavoidable commitment in Belfast meant I couldn't be there; however, I support the bill.
@SianAlliance I liked the panda/biscuit combo too.  But mainly the "Christmas at Christmas' stuff. :D
@Katherine_B_96 @Girlguiding Thanks for the message: I've signed up in support. As a former Guide & Guider, I believe that #GirlsMatter too.
@MorpheusNI And because MoJ has no operational role in DPP or PSNI.  Sec of State now regrets not briefing him when she took office.

@pjones_patricia @BBCgmu I will continue to pursue as far as I can to seek justice for those who were abused while vulnerable children.
After @BBCgmu, @StephenNolan & Radio Foyle re alleged security forces abuse of children in care, now to hear Jonathan Powell re OTR Inquiry.
@tell1999 @PadraigMcGowan There may be further developments in that regard.  No cover up of child abuse can ever be justified.
@tell1999 @PadraigMcGowan The allegations are public domain & have been considered. Other cases, where victims contacted me, are sub judice.
@tell1999 @PadraigMcGowan Same place as now - condemning all child abuse and cover ups of it.
@Dr_Eoin_Malcolm No, you don't!  Lol!
Brilliant result for NI tonight.  A good start is half the work.  Good end to a great sporting weekend.
@badgersni @mofitzmaurice @LeagueNI @DrBrianMay @BadgerTrust Dead foxes are also used to cover up badger-baiting. NI needs the hunting ban.

@scott_jamison @NualaMcAllister @SteveDonnan @PmcR87  Well, you're all a bundle of joy this morning.  Glad I'm heading to Westminster.
@actioncancer Sorry I can't call in as I'm in Westminster but have RT.  Best wishes for the day - great work as always.
@RationalPanic Saw this.  Wish I'd thought of it first.  I'll propose a bational scheme in Westminster.  ;) @puncturedplum @BelfastBabs
@mndcampaignsNI @MNDA_NI @mndassoc Keep up the good work.
@Chris_Lyttle @MNDA_NI @mndassoc @mndcampaignsNI Well done!  Quite a production. I should have been watching with popcorn in the cinema. :)
@stevenpatt99 Glad to hear it's all sorted.  :)
@RoaringMeg1872 @NualaMcAllister Not at all.  Strong condemnation.  As it should be.

@jonny_91ibrox Perhaps you missed my reply....
@RoaringMeg1872 I've passed your complaint to my colleague, Cllr @NualaMcAllister who represents North Belfast on the Council.
@prodlegacy @allianceparty No one called you racist. You chose to deny racism & tried to excuse it with victim-blaming. No one asked you to.
@Irish_Gaels @BBCMarkSimpson @SuitorMenswear @DavidFordMLA I did my bit and nominated @JudithCochrane Still waiting on her video.... :D
@Noel000123Noel @DavidFordMLA We actually both have family affected by #MND.  Whereas you are just trolling people.
@BBCMarkSimpson I assume you know that @DavidFordMLA just nominated you and Seamus McKee for the #IceBucketChallenge ?  Can't wait.  Lol!

@newbelfast Conn O'Neill bridge, one of the oldest stone arch bridges in Ireland.  According to my father-in-law who's a bridge expert. :)
@kyleshanks9 @TruthNi @prodlegacy @Niantibigotry  Third largest party in Belfast and best ever Euro result.  Do your research.
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry Yes. She polled the best vote Alliance ever polled in Europe.  That'll teach her....
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry Nisha & Anna are speaking of *exactly* the same thing - racism in NI & their experience of it, direct & indirect.
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry Aye. These women who dare to have an opinion.  Down with that sort of thing...
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry  So Nisha can feel that way legitimately but not Anna? You're not biased at all...
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry Not at all - still working away and chairing her Stormont committee.  What's Nisha's 'stunt' about, then?
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry I exercise my  views all the time.  I don't attack other people or their property or engage in intimidation.
@whitelupis Or we could work at being more welcoming and supportive.  And less violent. Just a thought.
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry Victim blaming is as bad as racism.
@prodlegacy @Niantibigotry He was taking about forces and gravity, not excusing racism.  She is as entitled to an opinion as anyone else.
Such a shame that women like Nisha Tandon & Anna Lo who have made such a massive contribution to NI feel this way. http://t.co/vXHu5Ax3F9
@SteveDonnan Careful. That sounds like a lot.  You don't want to overdose.... :D
@weterpasson Go me!  Lol!
@JulieEGilmour @SteveDonnan Indeed. Revenge is a dish best served cold.  Ice cold. In a bucket. Lol!
@SteveDonnan I've passed this baton to Michael Long as I did it earlier. :)
@NoelMcAdam Given how long they take to answer Assembly Questions, you might want to pull up a comfy seat...
@weterpasson @BuzzFeedUK @TogetherDarling I did it at 12:56pm. Though I had just the one bucket thrown so Alistair's was more extreme. :D

@RSFB1690 @BigRaymond2 @allianceparty I had just done so on Facebook and was on here to do the same when I saw your comment.
@RSFB1690 @BigRaymond2 @NiallSF @allianceparty I think it's accurate. People hear what they chose to.  It was released to the media.
@BigRaymond2 @allianceparty @RSFB1690 You'd need to ask the mefia as they control coverage.  The statement was publucly issued.
@BigRaymond2 @RSFB1690 @NiallSF @allianceparty Selective hearing.

@belfastbarman We can.  If you give my office a call, we'll get a time arranged.
@EmmetMcDB @Chris_Lyttle never sings when I'm in the office. I am starting to take it personally. Or feel very lucky.  One of those two.

@OurWeeParty @dmcbfs I was writing for David.  He has a punctuation allergy. :)
@dmcbfs And a full stop or colon rather than a comma between way and you're would have been better, but I'll let it slide this once. ;)

@wburke111 @AndrewWilsonLFC @RationalPanic @Chris_Lyttle Thanks.  At best disruptive & wasteful of police resources. At worst, reckless.
@RSFB1690 @poleinbelfast @NiallSF No, it's not okay. All hate crime and intimidation is wrong. Inexcusable.
@Weejaylfc The HET process was set up to review all cases.  The OTRs scheme was a lot more selective and biased.

@AlexKane221b @situation_ni @RBlackBT Conclusion is still some way off. I think lack of structure/oversight made errors almost inevitable.
@AlexKane221b @situation_ni @RBlackBT No. Police again get the blame for a shambles with little or no structure or oversight.
@situation_ni @RBlackBT @AlexKane221b No. Thought it would be resolved through HET process in my case.
@RBlackBT @AlexKane221b The *issue* was discussed with all parties - we made a written submission at the time.  The *scheme* was not.

@naul_m @AmnestyNI Not sure you can do it without political agreement or it will be constantly undermined but party politicking needs to end
@naul_m @AmnestyNI Agreeing a process would do that. We need to stop weaponising the past if we want to trybto heal it.
@TruthNi You seem to have adequate time.  Put it to constructive use.
@TruthNi @allianceparty Sarcasm is never an improvement. You accused me of condoning violence.  I don't from any source. We're done here.
@TruthNi Go and do your research. All available online.
@TruthNi @allianceparty Your questions aren't fair. They aren't even questions.  Thry are thinly veiled accusations with a question mark.
@TruthNi @CregganDerry @allianceparty I have met previously with some of those involved.  And no doubt I will do so again.  My door is open.
@TruthNi An electoral one like every other politician.
@TruthNi @allianceparty Which is rubbish as a brief review of the facts would show.
@TruthNi @allianceparty Wise up.
@FergalMcFerran @OurWeeParty But he couldn't carry off the heels. :)
@OurWeeParty Nothing like a bit of #everdaysexism  :)
@TruthNi @CregganDerry @allianceparty There aren't.  No matter how much you'd wish otherwise.
@TruthNi @allianceparty As much as any other politician. And I didn't blame anyone but stated simply that I thought he had done so.
@unit2plus4 @allianceparty No alternative. Either engage & commit to resolve issues together or continue to squander opportunity bickering.
@TruthNi @allianceparty Are you suggesting that we did this or condone it?  Get a grip.
@TruthNi @allianceparty I thought David Ford had? I unveiled the memorial as Lord Mayor and it sickens me that anyone would attack it.

@GarethCole_PUP @Brian_Ulsterman Gareth, you clearly haven't bothered to follow or understand the thread as your comment makes no sense.
@WillJanice @Phil_Mac9896 @Brian_Ulsterman I haven't followed up either at this point, but will being doing so as I had said.
@KillickThere @scott_jamison Always gracious in victory.  Except in the sweepstake :D  #grudgematch.
@WillJanice @Phil_Mac9896 @Brian_Ulsterman I answered a few hours ago. If you want to engage and not just troll, read the tweets.
@WillJanice @Phil_Mac9896 @Brian_Ulsterman I just did reply about 10 mins ago when I saw it. Sorry to disappoint you.
@WillJanice @Phil_Mac9896 @Brian_Ulsterman No idea, Janice.  I didn't investigate and write the piece.
@OakMighty @Brian_Ulsterman They did, yes. And ran a piece on that incident alongside.
@WL_Martin @slet_uprg @Brian_Ulsterman No problem.
@slet_uprg @WL_Martin @Brian_Ulsterman I think teaching/ encouraging hatred in young people is despicable.  No ifs or buts.
@slet_uprg @WL_Martin @Brian_Ulsterman I raised the issue of kids posing as paramilitaries in response to this story. How is that biased?
@WillJanice @Phil_Mac9896 @Brian_Ulsterman Confirmed by the mother.
@Brian_Ulsterman Not yet, but did raise with Irish News who sought quote re child with KAT on head as another example of abuse of children.
@scott_jamison Nice line in loser talk, there.  To the victor, the spoils.  Make sure you don't spend my winnings.  ;)
@LaurenMulvenny @scott_jamison I'm worried, Lauren. No sign of Scott anywhere.  Do we need to put out an APB? :D #WorldCupFinal
@LaurenMulvenny @scott_jamison Let him compose himself.  He's been goading me all weekend.  He knows he gas it coming. :D
@LaurenMulvenny @scott_jamison He's crying.  All gotten messi for Argentina.  :)
@LordMadden Yeeeeooooowwww!!!!!!
@scott_jamison Happy dance in progress.  Please stand back to avoid injury. #goGermany!
@OurWeeParty @scott_jamison Did say he looked like an air steward. Contrasting buttons+double breasted = bad decision.  #longsfashionclinic
@dawnrgraham Sure!
@scott_jamison This is awful.  Not as bad as Ferdinand's suit, like.  But awful.
@scott_jamison This is agony. Agony! I think they know of our rivalry and can't decide who to crush.... #WorldCupFinal
@AndyBelfast There aren't any no go areas for us. I was at meetings in the immediate area a week ago & saw the bonfire for myself yesterday.
@AndyBelfast Quite a few as a kid. What's that got to do with it?
@AndyBelfast Would make a welcome change if you did. You said these things were down to kids. You had no evidence. Photo shows otherwise.
@AndyBelfast BTW here are some 'kids' at a bonfire with an effigy.  Can we agree to stop blaming 'kids' now? http://t.co/0LfyRgSwn9
@AndyBelfast Many of those I work for and represent live in that area. I don't claim to lead loyalism: that's who needs to address this.

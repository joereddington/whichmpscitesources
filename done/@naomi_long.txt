@SamBraik96 @belfastcityfan I'd rather people vote yes because they're convinced than threat of discipline. Slowly moving in right direction Tue Apr 28 01:51:27 BST 2015
@simsim240 I'm disappointed too, but we have 5 for, 3 abs, 0 against which is progress since last vote.  Need to keep working to deliver. Tue Apr 28 01:49:30 BST 2015
@emeraldunion @Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty Not at all. Curious to why my vote matters in a referendum as you'd vote for yourself. Tue Apr 28 01:48:07 BST 2015
@xBobbyJean We have knocked your door then - you must have been out.  You may not be so lucky next time. :) Tue Apr 28 01:47:14 BST 2015
@belfastcityfan I'm disappointed but step in the right direction. If we're going to deliver this, we need to convince people to change view Tue Apr 28 00:02:36 BST 2015
@I_am_Leighton_ @emeraldunion @Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty Okay. That follows.... Tue Apr 28 00:01:14 BST 2015
@xBobbyJean We've knocked every door in all but a couple of dozen streets (we're still going). PM your address - might have missed you. :) Tue Apr 28 00:00:44 BST 2015
@MVMCCU No problem.  Important issues. :) Mon Apr 27 23:58:20 BST 2015
@MVMCCU Fatal abnormality is generally  detected at 20 week scan. No reason I can think why should be required later in pregnancy. Mon Apr 27 23:57:46 BST 2015
@MVMCCU I don't think that is possible - no way to legislate for it properly.  Ad said in previous tweet, some case covered by present law. Mon Apr 27 23:34:54 BST 2015
@MVMCCU I think that should be covered by current law under permanent damage to mental/physical well-being of mother. Mon Apr 27 23:33:33 BST 2015
@ThomasGray1981 @allianceparty We did. 5 voted for, 3 abstained. Mon Apr 27 23:27:27 BST 2015
@MVMCCU That position hasn't changed. Mon Apr 27 23:27:04 BST 2015
@emeraldunion @Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty If was a referendum tomorrow you'd have your own vote. Why would it matter to you how I voted? Mon Apr 27 23:26:36 BST 2015
@MVMCCU I oppose abortion on demand & wouldn't extend 67 act. I do think current law should be amended for fatal foetal abnormality. Mon Apr 27 23:25:13 BST 2015
@ItsmeJerryG @stephenpglenn Stephen can speak for himself. I'm disappointed that 3 of our MLAs didn't support it, but glad didn't oppose. Mon Apr 27 23:23:19 BST 2015
@emeraldunion @Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty I think my position on this has been so widely discussed that no-one is seriously in any doubt Mon Apr 27 23:21:46 BST 2015
@MVMCCU I am in favour of abortion being legal in the case of fatal foetal abnormality. Mon Apr 27 23:20:30 BST 2015

@Flidley @allianceparty  I didn't. @AndrewMuirNI wouldn't. Think they remain unconvinced but didn't want to oppose. Maybe best to ask them? Mon Apr 27 19:42:26 BST 2015

@JaspWilliams I already have - just waiting on the verification email process which didn't work first time round. :) Mon Apr 27 18:05:11 BST 2015
@Flidley @allianceparty @AndrewMuirNI Yes. Mon Apr 27 18:04:26 BST 2015

@clairejt @Wasthatmee @Ex_Chemist @allianceparty Not denying it's important.  That's why I proposed policy two years ago & supported it. Mon Apr 27 16:52:56 BST 2015
@Wasthatmee @clairejt @JasonONeill1 Five did & have: three who abstained previously opposed. Prefer progress was quicker but we're engaging. Mon Apr 27 16:50:59 BST 2015
@Wasthatmee @Ex_Chemist @allianceparty @clairejt Important issue - but elections aren't about a single issue. We're working to deliver. Mon Apr 27 16:49:11 BST 2015
@iamscassidy I'd prefer all voted in favour, but at least none voted against. Key now is to keep engaging to try to deliver the policy. Mon Apr 27 16:44:56 BST 2015

@Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty Emailed twice to ask format/timings as needed to fit with diary. No reply so sent apology & offered meeting. Mon Apr 27 16:38:30 BST 2015
@CrDoire PoC set outcome. Disappointed not all voted yes, but glad none opposed. How many SDLP were absent? Most avoided it in Westminister. Mon Apr 27 16:34:03 BST 2015

@WackersWorld @WJProgressive Never futile to register support for something important.  :) Sun Apr 26 17:00:13 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @WJProgressive Potentially. Only case law was that GP could decide on mental health & wellbeing. Guidance raised threshold. Sun Apr 26 16:20:50 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @WJProgressive Fatal foetal abnormality problems arose because Poots' guidance limited legal  interpretation of perm harm. Sun Apr 26 15:57:00 BST 2015
@MLAsAndTheLike  Careful with the 'old' there.  Lol. ;) Sun Apr 26 15:54:59 BST 2015
@WackersWorld @WJProgressive You can vote Alliance. So can progressive Nationalists. The constitutional issue not at stake in this election. Sun Apr 26 15:21:55 BST 2015
@rcampbell1988 Sadly not shocked. Just increasingly frustrated that many people still think by voting for them they'll get progress. Sun Apr 26 15:19:44 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @WJProgressive Legal definition makes drafting difficult. May be possible under guidance w/ current law on permanent harm. Sun Apr 26 15:07:26 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @belfastbarman Arriving at?  We're beyond that. Their view of society is so alien to 21st C Britain, it's hard to comprehend. Sun Apr 26 13:56:35 BST 2015
@belfastbarman @WJProgressive Not pestering - what elections should be about.  Happy to answer questions.  And to see a whiteboard #oldskool Sun Apr 26 13:52:01 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I will send you my climate change stuff through later....we have a fair bit in the manifesto if you want to check it out. Sun Apr 26 13:47:28 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Too many oppose abortion but make it hard to raise children alone or stigmatise pregnant teens. Can't have it both ways. Sun Apr 26 13:46:21 BST 2015
@WJProgressive it's a sensitive issue. Because of my views I also support sex ed in schools & proper support for single & young parents. Sun Apr 26 13:45:11 BST 2015
@WJProgressive As you know this is a matter of conscience not policy for the party, but I don't support abortion on demand. Sun Apr 26 13:42:59 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Support current law amended for fatal foetal abnormality. Think there is a case for allowing in the case of rape/incest. Sun Apr 26 12:55:59 BST 2015
@jamesworkman11 I've stuck to that and delivered on it. You'll never 100% agree with any politician, but I did exactly what I said I would. Sat Apr 25 22:45:58 BST 2015
@jamesworkman11 The views of those who elected me are pretty diverse. We set out our manifesto and policies which says what we'll do. Sat Apr 25 22:45:00 BST 2015

@Comberloyal Look at my voting record.  That's the key to judging how we'll vote in future. Sat Apr 25 17:51:18 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Sad but not rare.  No party's perfect - vote for best option. Only way to change politics. Otherwise, more clowns, same circus. Sat Apr 25 17:49:56 BST 2015
@Comberloyal That's why it can't be enacted until Assembly have agreed a proper and sustainable budget - quite rightly in my view. Sat Apr 25 17:46:49 BST 2015
@Neilkelly13 @SianAlliance @DavidFordMLA Lol.  Neil I had no idea you were an ex-ginger. Sat Apr 25 17:45:13 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @ianjamesparsley @allianceparty Depends on context. We have formal free votes on life/death matters, for example. Sat Apr 25 17:44:30 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Voted in favour of legislation as did all NI parties but will only be able to be enacted once we have a sustainable budget. Sat Apr 25 17:42:57 BST 2015
@Comberloyal It's not just about the PM, it's about the policy. I voted against austerity cuts & welfare reform in last parliament. Sat Apr 25 17:30:24 BST 2015
@Comberloyal I was chased by someone today for being too socialist. You can't please everyone I guess....lol Sat Apr 25 17:28:33 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Why not vote Alliance? Sat Apr 25 17:26:47 BST 2015
@Comberloyal If there's coalition post-election, the prog for govt will be up for negotiation. More likely to seek support issue by issue. Sat Apr 25 17:26:21 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Except I'm not going with a begging bowl - I'm going with policies which will get support in other UK regions & benefit NI. Sat Apr 25 17:23:38 BST 2015
@mc_mishy @allianceparty Glad to get the nice feedback. :) Sat Apr 25 17:22:22 BST 2015
@Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty I've held surgeries, delivered newsletters, done surveys all over East outside canvassing. Sat Apr 25 17:21:33 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Depends which one was delivering more of my manifesto pledges and the kind of open, tolerant and fair society I want to see. Sat Apr 25 17:18:28 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @ianjamesparsley @allianceparty No, though wish were for. Both have record of working for LGBT rights against homophobia. Sat Apr 25 17:16:53 BST 2015

@Boomer2212 Do you believe it is possible, by extending or defending LGBT rights, to make people gay?  That's what 'promote' suggests. Fri Apr 24 15:23:16 BST 2015

@stevie_huge We knocked each door in your street on 11th April. Must have missed you. I'll let you decide if you're lucky/unlucky. :) Wed Apr 22 14:23:52 BST 2015
@stevie_huge I do now, so pm me if that helps. Wed Apr 22 13:56:32 BST 2015

@wearepbd @allianceparty @dmcbfs @SluggerOToole Lol!  Don't think so. Thanks for all your input. Tue Apr 21 22:38:16 BST 2015
@allianceparty @dmcbfs @SluggerOToole @wearepbd I'm waiting..... I think the voice-over deserves a mention.... lol Tue Apr 21 22:29:32 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @AaronB_1996 I agree.  Over 50% and it has marginal influence on tax take as people simply avoid/move. Tue Apr 21 21:17:26 BST 2015
@impongo2 @prodlegacy @WJProgressive Sorry - you have lost me. What quotes? Tue Apr 21 20:23:38 BST 2015
@AaronB_1996 @WJProgressive I hope it's clear now or William's whiteboard will be a mess. :D Tue Apr 21 20:20:38 BST 2015
@AaronB_1996 @WJProgressive Have I confused things now?  Lol. Right. Start again. I voted against the reduction from & for return to 50%. :) Tue Apr 21 20:16:32 BST 2015
@prodlegacy @WJProgressive In fairness, almost all parties opposed rise but not our decision. Believe it or not, most MPs agree with you. :) Tue Apr 21 20:10:52 BST 2015
@impongo2 @prodlegacy @WJProgressive @SDLPlive @FearghalSDLP Everyone took it at the same time. Seriously, it's just any excuse to have a go Tue Apr 21 20:06:56 BST 2015
@AaronB_1996 @WJProgressive And?  I wouldn't lower it. I thought that was the point of William's question? Tue Apr 21 20:05:53 BST 2015
@impongo2 @prodlegacy @WJProgressive @SDLPlive @FearghalSDLP No. All the parties opposed it. They said they wouldn't take it and did. Tue Apr 21 18:44:40 BST 2015
@Endpuppyfarmsni Drop me an email & I'll send you an update on my work on this. naomi.long@allianceparty.org  Happy to help see this ended. Tue Apr 21 18:39:38 BST 2015
@impongo2 @prodlegacy @WJProgressive @SDLPlive @FearghalSDLP Same reason we gave at the time. We just didn't say one thing & do another. Tue Apr 21 18:37:35 BST 2015
@prodlegacy @WJProgressive If refuse salary you're taxed like you got it. Different for allowances so I refused my Lord Mayor all. of £27k. Tue Apr 21 18:35:48 BST 2015
@prodlegacy @WJProgressive Not that I know, but no rise has happened yet. SDLP said they wouldn't take  Assembly rise but then did. Tue Apr 21 18:32:55 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Maintain it & voted to do so. Tue Apr 21 18:17:50 BST 2015
@prodlegacy @WJProgressive Opposed the rise. Salaries & expenses taken over by an independent body so the decision wasn't MPs'. Tue Apr 21 18:17:03 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Both. The financial sector for their greed and disregard for rules & the politicians for failing to regulate effectively. Tue Apr 21 17:12:30 BST 2015

@WeeBelfastBelle @nornirongunner @impongo2 Corporate? Lol. Mon Apr 20 21:18:38 BST 2015
@PurpleStandard @DesertWill @allianceparty No, but if we can reach fair & respectful accommodation it's in everyone's long-term interest Mon Apr 20 17:33:40 BST 2015
@WeeBelfastBelle @nornirongunner @impongo2 Well, I'm sure you know more than me about it. I was only a Civil Engineer for 10 years.... Mon Apr 20 17:15:56 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @allianceparty Councils are service providers & employers not just political bodies so need to recognise equality duties 2/2 Mon Apr 20 17:15:01 BST 2015
@nornirongunner How/when the Union Flag is flown in a divided society - respecting it's unique constitutional position - is complex.  1/2 Mon Apr 20 17:13:21 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @allianceparty Are laws about how Councils make decisions & if it's alleged they've been broken it can end in court. Mon Apr 20 17:11:09 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @allianceparty Same advice as Lisburn and Ards too, I think, where unionists agreed to desig days. Mon Apr 20 16:45:12 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @allianceparty Not all do. C/avon went back to 365 from desig days (which unionists prev supported) &  being taken to court. Mon Apr 20 16:42:15 BST 2015
@WeeBelfastBelle @nornirongunner @impongo2 You've not noticed hosepipe bans, low water levels in our reservoirs at various periods? Mon Apr 20 16:21:04 BST 2015
#StepForward #Naomi4East http://t.co/PDaqwrPZdv Mon Apr 20 14:22:49 BST 2015
@DesertWill I believe in doing what's right not what's expedient or popular.  We did the right thing - no point being elected otherwise. Mon Apr 20 13:45:01 BST 2015
@DesertWill David is the leader and wasn't mentioned. Plus the PUP aren't running fir Westminster. Mon Apr 20 13:43:54 BST 2015
@timeyoutakeit Yep. Proxy and postal deadline has passed. Mon Apr 20 13:34:10 BST 2015
@offalyhurlers Stephen, if you ring my office on 02890472004, we'll see if we can assist. Mon Apr 20 13:33:30 BST 2015
@DesertWill There was no consensus and was never going to be. A decusion had to be taken and we voted to implement our policy. Mon Apr 20 13:32:47 BST 2015
@DesertWill Why else put my contact details on their bogus leaflets, full of inaccuracy and inflammatory language? I wasn't a Councillor. Mon Apr 20 13:31:54 BST 2015
@DesertWill This one. In East Belfast. Mon Apr 20 13:03:59 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 Already answered. Mon Apr 20 12:19:05 BST 2015
@DesertWill Unionist parties in Belfast wouldn't consider change even though supported desig days elsewhere. Wanted flag as electoral issue. Mon Apr 20 12:18:32 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 No *some* people who use more will, others who use less will pay *less*. You understand difference perfectly well. Mon Apr 20 12:16:25 BST 2015
@DesertWill Democracy is right of elected reps to decide. Only threat to that was violence. Desig days isn't unjust. Best policy and UK wide Mon Apr 20 12:11:21 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 No I didn't.  I said some people may pay more if they use more, other who use less will pay less. Mon Apr 20 12:09:30 BST 2015
@impongo2 @stephen82754737 @kmgwm @DesertWill Desig Days was our policy since 2002 when Billy Hutchinson backed us. Was SF/SDLP who shifted. Mon Apr 20 12:08:25 BST 2015
@impongo2 @stephen82754737 @kmgwm @DesertWill Totally false. Voted against no flag each time. SF/SDLP switched to back desig days at council Mon Apr 20 12:07:10 BST 2015
@stephen82754737 @kmgwm @DesertWill You'd need to ask BCC as I wasn't on Council. Not aware of them having done so as no legal requirement. Mon Apr 20 12:03:44 BST 2015
@DesertWill If surcharged you're barred as councillor & risk bankruptcy due to costs. Wouldn't advise anyone to ignore that legal advice. Mon Apr 20 12:02:15 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 Because that's incorrect. People who use less will pay less. That's exactly what I said when asked. Mon Apr 20 11:58:30 BST 2015
@stephen82754737 @kmgwm @DesertWill Did EQIA as legally required.  Recent academic evaluation showed DUP/UUP bogus leaflet increased tension Mon Apr 20 11:48:23 BST 2015
@DesertWill So, in light of that, what would you have done? Mon Apr 20 11:45:41 BST 2015
@DesertWill Also, proposed moratorium on all flag decision in new councils until region agreement. Rejected by both UUP and DUP. Mon Apr 20 11:45:17 BST 2015
@DesertWill If we hadn't voted at all, the flag would have been removed permanently as more nationalist than unionist councillors. Mon Apr 20 11:44:13 BST 2015
@DesertWill We took legal advice twice with same result. Same with EQIA. If vote contrary to legal advice Cllrs could be surcharged. Mon Apr 20 11:43:27 BST 2015
Forms after midnight will not be eligible. Can use ANY electoral office mailbox not just local one.  But don't miss the deadline. 2/2 Mon Apr 20 11:42:00 BST 2015
EONI have confirmed you can submit your electoral registration form via the electoral office mailbox until MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 1/2 Mon Apr 20 11:40:50 BST 2015
@DesertWill How would you have accommodated the two intractable positions in the face of legal and equality advice? Mon Apr 20 11:32:14 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 Those who use more will pay more - that's the point - but not addition charge. And we do have water shortages btw Mon Apr 20 11:31:11 BST 2015
@kmgwm @DesertWill Timing of decision out of our hands. SF proposal to Ctte in November meant Council decision December. No will to delay. Mon Apr 20 11:29:52 BST 2015
@DesertWill @allianceparty Not so. We'd have breached of legal duty. Neither side sought consensus. Ours was only reasonable compromise. Mon Apr 20 11:28:37 BST 2015
@DesertWill Sensitive decision, but misleading & inflammatory statements created volatile atmosphere, yet those who made them walk free. 2/2 Mon Apr 20 11:25:38 BST 2015
@DesertWill I agree, but we never called a single person onto streets nor did we encourage illegal protests. Others whipped up tension. 1/2 Mon Apr 20 11:22:35 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @allianceparty Welsh Water is mutualised. Mon Apr 20 11:20:32 BST 2015
@mattb_cx @TEDxOmagh Try naomi.long@allianceparty.org. Mon Apr 20 11:19:37 BST 2015
@DesertWill @allianceparty Not an option.
1. Debate for >10yrs & no consensus. 
2. Once raised had duty to vote with legal/equality advice Mon Apr 20 11:19:10 BST 2015
@Lingo_sue_23 Can't comment on an individual case. Generally, believe all hate speech/incitement must be properly investigated & prosecuted Mon Apr 20 11:13:23 BST 2015
@mattb_cx @TEDxOmagh Potentially.  We'd need to check diary nearer the time, though. Mon Apr 20 11:10:07 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @allianceparty If you were listening, I said in favour of mutualisation not privatisation ie not for profit social model Mon Apr 20 11:09:29 BST 2015
@TheKipperMan @allianceparty Totally agree. Politically-driven, costly distraction to delivering service which only Alliance opposed at Exec Mon Apr 20 11:07:54 BST 2015
@impongo2 @nornirongunner Didn't say otherwise. Said we would reduce the rate so no-one pays twice if separate water charge. Mon Apr 20 11:06:46 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn Already pay £275m from public funds through rates. We would reduce rates & introduce sep charge which encourages conservation Mon Apr 20 11:05:29 BST 2015
@leanbhinchinn @allianceparty It isn't free. We have to treat it, convey it, collect the waste and treat that too.  All has to be paid for. Mon Apr 20 11:03:15 BST 2015
@superoz83 @Lingo_sue_23 @impongo2 Correct. We voted against no flag at ctte.  SF/SDLP against our amendment at ctte, then reversed position Mon Apr 20 11:02:15 BST 2015
@mattb_cx @allianceparty We're working to change it. I'm committed to full equality & working to convince others of the benefits. Mon Apr 20 11:00:33 BST 2015
@nornirongunner @impongo2 Encourage conservation of water & frees up NIW to borrow for capital investment, allowing infrastructure upgrade Mon Apr 20 10:58:42 BST 2015
Today is the last day to register to vote. In NI you need to do this in person so go to your local electoral office to secure your vote. Mon Apr 20 10:57:00 BST 2015
@impongo2 They pay already - it's about paying differently. Want a single, separate, identifiable charge & corresponding reduction in rates. Mon Apr 20 10:38:11 BST 2015
@CarolmarBeattie Don't hear Tories talk of wealth redistribution. And you pay for water now btw. Just want you to pay differently. Mon Apr 20 10:36:16 BST 2015
@impongo2 @allianceparty @Lingo_sue_23 Your caps lock appears to be stuck. Mon Apr 20 10:33:21 BST 2015
@mattb_cx @allianceparty Why we're in favour. Equal Marriage sadly contentious across these islands - want to manage change so not divisive. Mon Apr 20 10:31:58 BST 2015
@superoz83 @Lingo_sue_23 @impongo2 @allianceparty It's a fact that if Alliance had abstained the flag wouldn't fly at all. Read the minutes. Mon Apr 20 10:27:22 BST 2015

#StepForward #Naomi4East http://t.co/ZTFbt6sXEs Sun Apr 19 17:45:50 BST 2015
@munro1798 Our plan specifically include tacking waste at Stormont - we think it would bd wrong to charge more whilst budget is mismanaged. Sun Apr 19 12:58:29 BST 2015
@munro1798 I don't think that's fair. Part of the social contract is that we contribute fairly when we can & are protected when in need. Sun Apr 19 12:38:04 BST 2015
@munro1798 District rate goes to local council, regional rate goes to supplement block grant for general services. No direct hypothecation. Sun Apr 19 12:36:13 BST 2015
@munro1798 So sick people pay more?  That's not progressive taxation. Sun Apr 19 12:33:58 BST 2015
@munro1798 All the way through.  Raising the threshold at which people first become liable for tax for example. Sun Apr 19 12:32:52 BST 2015
@munro1798 We did pay until charges scrapped a few years ago. Was never included in rates or Nat Ins. Has been taken out of block grant. Sun Apr 19 12:31:42 BST 2015
@munro1798 Rates don't pay prescriptions: from block grant. If those who can afford to pay small charge, that could protect health service Sun Apr 19 12:29:51 BST 2015
@munro1798 Unfair on those who are most ill/whose treatments most complex. Better to have standard charge w/ protections for low income. Sun Apr 19 12:25:54 BST 2015
@matrobinson @Conservatives @LibDems @UKLabour Voted with coalition when they promoted Alliance values last time & against when they didn't. Sun Apr 19 12:08:15 BST 2015

@KerriDunn @AllisonMorris1 @ScholesWilliam @willowfieldpc Thankfully, I missed it but was told about it later.  #stayclassy Wed Apr 15 17:54:54 BST 2015
@EB_LTW We've lobbied for extra security, eg CCTV & policing at interface to reduce attacks but will only end if we deal with sectarianism. Wed Apr 15 17:43:06 BST 2015
@Farce1111 I wasn't here when it started but fossil records give a fair indication. :) Wed Apr 15 17:40:04 BST 2015
@StephNixon82 I hadn't been notified either but saw signs. I'll ask @EmmetMcDB to contact them first thing as it makes access very awkward Wed Apr 15 17:37:21 BST 2015
@EBCA @ianjamesparsley @EANInews Okay.  @neil4ebelfast was mentioned and slides of his campaign message were shown at the start. Wed Apr 15 17:35:21 BST 2015

@EBCA @ianjamesparsley I understand all candidates invited on Monday - 5 turned up. @EANInews can confirm. I'm happy with that format. Wed Apr 15 13:51:19 BST 2015
@Sineadmlarkin Thanks for your time. I'll be in touch shortly about follow up. Wed Apr 15 13:47:41 BST 2015
@Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty Absolutely none. Both are wrong.  Both must stop. Tue Apr 14 23:05:25 BST 2015
@presseyephoto @chambrepa @SluggerOToole @GRobinsonDUP I'd have chinned him but I couldn't reach. :D Tue Apr 14 22:10:50 BST 2015
@Michaeldowney11 @allianceparty Asta is 'my own people' as much as anyone else - thankfully most decent people in east agree. Tue Apr 14 21:59:40 BST 2015
Racism is a cancer which destroys lives & communities. Proud to see East Belfast unite against it. Tue Apr 14 21:21:35 BST 2015
Strong support for Asta from the local community & political representatives in East Belfast tonight in the wake of attack on her business. Tue Apr 14 21:21:22 BST 2015
@PunksatonyPics Happy to. Awful attack. Tue Apr 14 15:20:30 BST 2015
#StepForward #Naomi4East http://t.co/t17Q8TCjK2 Tue Apr 14 12:45:38 BST 2015
@Dru_12 You need to take this up with @SluggerOToole who organised it. I had no role in ticket allocation whatsoever. Tue Apr 14 12:15:28 BST 2015
@Dru_12 I didn't organise the event. The tickets were open application. Tue Apr 14 11:42:30 BST 2015
@SteveDonnelly95 She's also been attacked for wanting the job. If a woman wants to lead she's 'power-crazed' : a man is 'ambitious'. #Yawn Tue Apr 14 08:34:27 BST 2015
@SteveDonnelly95 I know people half her age who would love half her energy.  If she was a man she would 'experienced' and 'distinguished'. Tue Apr 14 08:31:12 BST 2015
@dt_BT51 @LADFLEG I think you just have. :) Tue Apr 14 08:28:58 BST 2015
@AlexKane221b Genius articles.  Especially given how hard local politics is to satirise or parody. :) Tue Apr 14 00:56:16 BST 2015
@MichaelQuinn70 @allianceparty I recognise we need compassionate response, but have profound concerns assisted dying will cheapen life. 3/3 Mon Apr 13 23:05:53 BST 2015
@MichaelQuinn70 @allianceparty Pressure can make people vulnerable at the end of their lives. End of life & palliative care required. 2/3 Mon Apr 13 23:04:43 BST 2015
@MichaelQuinn70 @allianceparty Can blur lines of medics to 'first do no harm' & create pressure to end life to avoid being a burden. 1/3 Mon Apr 13 23:02:29 BST 2015
@OutsiderNI @allianceparty Distraction politics at it's worst. It's the issues I'm focused on and which will really affect people's lives. Mon Apr 13 22:58:11 BST 2015
@Kalista63 @allianceparty @TobyArgyll Yes. I did. Mon Apr 13 22:53:51 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @ihiccupalot @allianceparty  Potential to address through current law of  permanent damage to health & wellbeing of mother. 2/2 Mon Apr 13 22:52:04 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @ihiccupalot @allianceparty I accept is a moral case for considering that, but have difficulty with legal definition. 1/2 Mon Apr 13 22:48:57 BST 2015
@GLL_UK @isabelsbaby @neen290 @Betterhelpers Contract staff in impossible position. Continue to pursue w/ colleagues. Needs fairly resolved. Mon Apr 13 17:16:05 BST 2015

@Boomer2212 @JasonONeill1 No idea. None in East. Sun Apr 12 22:34:30 BST 2015
@Boomer2212 @JasonONeill1 Photo was taken yesterday. So, technically, yes as the sabbath is a Saturday. Sun Apr 12 22:30:30 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 it wasn't the warmest. Lol.  Less hot air produced than usual, too. :) Sun Apr 12 21:21:19 BST 2015
@neil4ebelfast @JasonONeill1 Lol! You in our canvass photos & @GRobinsonDUP in @TrevorLunnLV literature. Proof we really are #ForEveryone :D Sun Apr 12 21:20:11 BST 2015
@Badnewsbadger48 Neither excuse nor ploy, just fact. Anyway, @NiallSF worn out by debates he's juggling, so I'm going to leave it tonight :) Sun Apr 12 21:16:14 BST 2015
@JasonONeill1 Thanks for your help yesterday! Sun Apr 12 21:13:23 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 For what it's worth I think all candidates should be there. Front runners last time were Robinson and Ringland. :) Sun Apr 12 21:11:36 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 Agree focus now needs to be on fairer distribution of accessible provision, including in east. Sun Apr 12 21:08:27 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 Wasn't in isolation. I was on leisure strategy & was first step in citywide plan. Left east & south out in cold. Sun Apr 12 21:07:42 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 Not disputing our vote, but was part of strategy to deliver better provision across city. SF/UUP deal killed it. Sun Apr 12 21:02:35 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 In the minutes. Fra McCann & Davy Brown cut a deal & their parties backed it. Broke all-party city-wide plans. Sun Apr 12 20:57:49 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 No. The crossparty strategy collapsed when SF & UUP did deal on Falls & Grove which cut out East & the rest. Sun Apr 12 19:46:00 BST 2015
@Badnewsbadger48 @NiallSF That's why we supported a rebuild at a neutral location which everyone could access. Sun Apr 12 18:11:21 BST 2015
@NiallSF @Badnewsbadger48 @ninews If rebuilds had happened as planned, would have enhanced shared provision Others pulled plug w/ side-deals Sun Apr 12 17:43:39 BST 2015
@castleDD @NewtonEmerson Lol! Sun Apr 12 17:32:16 BST 2015
@Badnewsbadger48 @ninews As part of plan to invest in new facilities across city, broken by SF & UU deal. We kept RC doors open in C/reagh. Sun Apr 12 17:31:52 BST 2015
@NewtonEmerson Lol!  Fantastic. That's me. Always twirling, twirling, twirling.... Sun Apr 12 17:19:01 BST 2015
@Badnewsbadger48 @WJProgressive Think that's a generalisation. Depends on contract spec & regs. Com & vol sector provide key services well. Sun Apr 12 15:38:17 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Think it should be minimised, carefully regulated/controlled. I have consistently voted against further privatisation of NHS. Sun Apr 12 14:50:44 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Also specialist back office functions can be more efficient if outsourced again due to specialisation. Sun Apr 12 14:48:56 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Not always. Where do only simple, repetitive procedures with low risk, can do more efficiently but still rely on NHS backup Sun Apr 12 14:47:58 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Not that they can't do it but currently some services contrated out. I'd prefer they did do it. Sun Apr 12 14:43:11 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Where private can do the job more efficiently, there can be limited role, but we need caution to avoid two tier provision. Sun Apr 12 14:40:05 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I'd prefer wasn't case as while reduces wait for patients, more expensive than pub sect. Money better invested in NHS. 2/2 Sun Apr 12 14:38:01 BST 2015
@WJProgressive At present it's a bout 4-6% of service. Private provide back office & frontline service incl. waiting list reduction. 1/2 Sun Apr 12 14:35:48 BST 2015
@tomfromireland @Abbe_Faria_ @WJProgressive One if the many issues I campaigned on in Westminster. Sun Apr 12 14:13:25 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Opposed TTIP including NHS as would lead to sig privatisation which not in public interest. Sun Apr 12 14:06:35 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Delivery through public sector plus comm & vol sector, that already plays key role in early intervention, home support, etc Sun Apr 12 14:04:04 BST 2015
@WJProgressive May be very limited role for private companies providing support services; however, there no place for profit motive in NHS. Sun Apr 12 14:01:41 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Right, Private sector involvement in the NHS....Principle of NHS is that it should be universal & free at point of access Sun Apr 12 14:00:09 BST 2015
@McKinleyAn @WJProgressive We try, on the doors and in hustings and meetings, plus in correspondence.  Always happy to answer questions. Sun Apr 12 13:33:42 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Also participated in campaigns against for eg Guantanamo & led delegations/presented petitions. Many ways to put on agenda. Sun Apr 12 13:30:52 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Have hosted those subjected to abuse in Parliament to let them meet MPs and Peers to raise awareness. Sun Apr 12 13:28:43 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I've hosted meetings w/ ministers, raised questions, tabled EDMs, secured debates & met w/ ambassadors of other countries. Sun Apr 12 13:27:30 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Also need to keep our record & our allies under constant review if we're to have any integrity in our challenge to others. Sun Apr 12 12:54:37 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Need to ensure that human rights & international law upheld w/ respect to torture & also persecution of minorities. Sun Apr 12 12:52:29 BST 2015
@WJProgressive UK govt engages w/ countries w/ poor human rights records. Have a duty to raise w/ them in all exchanges to press for change. Sun Apr 12 12:50:39 BST 2015
@WilliamFlegzer Not my analysis, as you'll see from my reply tweet. Sun Apr 12 12:14:52 BST 2015
@stewartcdickson @Independent_ie Interesting piece but marred by reference to 'so called Ballymurphy Massacre'. Pretty insulting to victims. Sun Apr 12 12:13:41 BST 2015
@Neilkelly13 @billmanwaring @DdeBK @stephen_nicholl Utterly disgusting. Hope those responsible are brought to justice. Sun Apr 12 11:39:31 BST 2015
@lewisjoan227 Thanks for your support Sun Apr 12 10:39:11 BST 2015
@BlameTheTories We did. Unlike this one, the parties in question failed to put their name on it. Sat Apr 11 23:28:19 BST 2015
@VickyBoylesM @allianceparty She's a force of nature. :) Sat Apr 11 21:59:22 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Best comparison is like with like. Double jobbers have poorer record in general and Alliance avg better than any other NI party Sat Apr 11 21:56:12 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Wouldn't for many reasons. Balancing demands of remote constituencies w/ fact that some business has no relevance in NI Sat Apr 11 21:54:55 BST 2015
@nikkit1978 Aww! I love your daughter. :D Sat Apr 11 21:53:00 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Lol! Happy to. :D Sat Apr 11 21:17:48 BST 2015
@nikkit1978 Great. Glad you liked it. :) Sat Apr 11 21:17:12 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Proposing motions isn't good comparator. Govt/Opp have alloted days: backbenchers don't. Link I gave looks at range of activity Sat Apr 11 21:16:12 BST 2015
@Comberloyal Attendance isn't recorded. I've often been there for a few days working and recorded no votes. Votes is the best proxy though Sat Apr 11 21:14:04 BST 2015
@Comberloyal You should add Martin McGuinness & Gerry Adams to Francie & Paul to get clear picture. Divide by votes you get value-ish. :) Sat Apr 11 21:13:01 BST 2015
@Comberloyal That's the only collective one I know. Sat Apr 11 21:09:41 BST 2015
@Comberloyal No one link but http://t.co/ce2Di2cQKt summarises voting records. @News_Letter today compared expenses w/ vr to get vfm Sat Apr 11 20:58:58 BST 2015
@lotjot34 @Wattie187 Aww.  Maybe later in the campaign. :D Sat Apr 11 18:04:31 BST 2015
@DavidFordMLA @AndrewMuirNI @MarkCarruthers7 Poor Mark will never live this down. Lol.  I was teasing him about it again this week. :) Sat Apr 11 16:48:17 BST 2015
@elwormio I was in Lisnasharragh today.  Glad you still got to chat with the team and thanks for your support. :) Sat Apr 11 16:44:48 BST 2015
@janemcon Added you so you can now. Sat Apr 11 14:34:27 BST 2015
@isabelsbaby Done. Sat Apr 11 14:01:25 BST 2015
@janemcon @PoliceServiceNI PM me with details and I can check this out. Sat Apr 11 14:01:01 BST 2015
@isabelsbaby @Lisa_browning @unitetheunion If you pm me your number, I'll get Michael to call you with an update after the meeting yesterday Sat Apr 11 09:45:34 BST 2015
@MarkCarruthers7 @BillyBuckTeeth The high point of my career! Lol. :) Fri Apr 10 21:49:41 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @ppdoddy There could be a number of solutions but city regions are probably the best established model. Fri Apr 10 20:40:38 BST 2015
@thedissenter I've answered this point earlier. Fri Apr 10 20:12:24 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @ppdoddy @voterossbrown @GRobinsonDUP  :( This politics is clearly no laughing matter. You may have a favourite joke round. Fri Apr 10 20:11:19 BST 2015
@thedissenter I don't think it is against our security interest but we'll not agree on that, I suspect. Fri Apr 10 20:09:10 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @ppdoddy I think regional devolution (say city regions) rather than an English Parliament are most viable option. Fri Apr 10 20:07:39 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I still haven't had a chance on the other two...you'll be deducting points for speed. :) Fri Apr 10 19:48:47 BST 2015
@WJProgressive lol. Fri Apr 10 19:48:09 BST 2015
@WJProgressive @ppdoddy That was reason for doing so. All MPs should be able to vote on all issues. Solve problem w/ devo to English regions Fri Apr 10 19:47:57 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I'm confused? I will vote on England only issues - I did in last Parliament. Don't support two teir W/minster. Pref Eng dev. Fri Apr 10 19:45:50 BST 2015
@ppdoddy @WJProgressive But I said I would vote on England only issues?  They impact on our budget and regulations. Fri Apr 10 19:43:15 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Did I get that question? Or was that the voting one? Fri Apr 10 19:30:23 BST 2015
@LADFLEG @kateyo  Sure @SimonHamilton was only copying @Chris_Lyttle with his facial topiary. Fri Apr 10 18:39:17 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @PaulaJaneB @allianceparty I think an open, inclusive, just society will deliver for all of UK, but priority is NI for me. Fri Apr 10 17:17:37 BST 2015
@Turpington @GarySpedding Many of our founding members came from NI Labour as well as outside political class and were involved then. Fri Apr 10 17:16:03 BST 2015
@thedissenter @GaryBroad1 @JohnMcCallister @BowesgaryGary @PrinceBuster69 No, but it wouldn't all be published online in a document. Fri Apr 10 17:14:24 BST 2015
@GaryBroad1 @thedissenter Our manifesto covers both due to policy overlap. Agree W/minster issues don't get focus deserve much of the time. Fri Apr 10 17:13:34 BST 2015
@GaryBroad1 @thedissenter @JohnMcCallister @BowesgaryGary @PrinceBuster69 Manifesto launch is next week at which point will be online. Fri Apr 10 17:04:01 BST 2015
@thedissenter @GaryBroad1 @JohnMcCallister @BowesgaryGary @PrinceBuster69 Manifesto isn't out yet. Postal literature can't cover everything. Fri Apr 10 17:02:23 BST 2015
@GaryBroad1 @thedissenter @JohnMcCallister @BowesgaryGary @PrinceBuster69 Voted against replacing Trident. Can reply fully by email if pm me Fri Apr 10 17:00:51 BST 2015
@GaryBroad1 @thedissenter @JohnMcCallister @BowesgaryGary @PrinceBuster69 Can't do that justice here: 140 char mostly taken up with names :) Fri Apr 10 16:57:41 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @PaulaJaneB @allianceparty Depends who delivers more of manifesto & the kind of fair, just & equitable society we aspire to. Fri Apr 10 16:54:21 BST 2015
@Turpington @GarySpedding Why wouldn't we? Women's suffrage & elected participation was never the sole preserve of any one party. Fri Apr 10 16:52:46 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @dmcbfs There are some studies.  Send me an email and I'll point you towards them if that helps. Fri Apr 10 16:51:11 BST 2015
@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive Opposed WR & austerity in W/minster. Once the budget for NI set have to live within means. Fri Apr 10 16:50:07 BST 2015
@syncni @YE_NI Fantastic opportunity.  Happy to share. Fri Apr 10 16:46:59 BST 2015
@roywhite_ni @dmcbfs Yes and the numbers are decreasing. Fri Apr 10 16:45:23 BST 2015
@BowesgaryGary @GaryBroad1 @PrinceBuster69 @allianceparty @JohnMcCallister Like a true and good politician. I keep my promises. :) Fri Apr 10 16:40:45 BST 2015
@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive Share concern & raised with Govt. In N Iraq airstrikes requested by that gov. Not so here. Fri Apr 10 16:39:56 BST 2015

@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive Voted to recognise Palestine & raised with FCO. Military intervention not always appropriate. Fri Apr 10 12:10:31 BST 2015
@BowesgaryGary @GaryBroad1 @PrinceBuster69 @allianceparty @JohnMcCallister Whoever delivers more of manifesto & fair, just inclusive society Fri Apr 10 12:08:27 BST 2015
@kateyo My election addresses (same format) are posted as well.  We knock doors where we have resources. Fri Apr 10 12:05:56 BST 2015
@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive Doctrine of protection & moral duty to help legitimate govt when asked. Voted against Syria. Fri Apr 10 12:04:01 BST 2015
@kateyo He ran for Council in Colin ward at the elections last May. Fri Apr 10 12:00:59 BST 2015
@davidsteed49 We'll get to you shortly. :) Knocking doors but if you aren't in you'll get a leaflet. Feel free to ring if you have questions Fri Apr 10 11:38:43 BST 2015
@BillyBuckTeeth Easy mistake to make. Lol!  Even @MarkCarruthers7 did it once and he's highly professional. :D Fri Apr 10 11:34:15 BST 2015
@GaryBroad1 @PrinceBuster69 @allianceparty @JohnMcCallister Not complex. Have own party & manifesto. Didn't take LD whip. Still liberal tho. Fri Apr 10 11:32:58 BST 2015
@PrinceBuster69 @allianceparty @JohnMcCallister @bbctheview We have no Peers. John resigned from Alliance while Assembly Speaker. Fri Apr 10 08:00:26 BST 2015
@BabGraham @AlexKane221b @MarkCarruthers7 @bbctheview @PumpHouseCafe @GRobinsonDUP Catch it in the right light it looks much darker :) Fri Apr 10 03:04:34 BST 2015
@BabGraham @AlexKane221b @MarkCarruthers7 @bbctheview @PumpHouseCafe @GRobinsonDUP Nope - just one of the benefits of being a redhead. :) Fri Apr 10 02:59:18 BST 2015
@DavidMurphy @ulsterpolitics @samnel84 @LADFLEG @StepWalkTV  I don't take the Lib Dem whip and never have, nor am I a member. Fri Apr 10 02:57:07 BST 2015

@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive It's a bit like security budget here. If people lived peacefully, it could be better invested Fri Apr 10 02:46:30 BST 2015
@NeroBealFeirste @allianceparty @WJProgressive Money I'd rather see spent elsewhere, but action to protect those under attack was required. Fri Apr 10 02:45:02 BST 2015

@isabelsbaby Michael is meeting with the Council tomorrow, so hopefully we will have something more to tell you tomorrow night. Fri Apr 10 00:07:12 BST 2015
@WJProgressive No. That's what I said.  Health & education indirectly affect us via regulation & budgets. That's why I vote on those issues. Fri Apr 10 00:04:30 BST 2015
@WJProgressive Quick one - no. Many issues technically devolved, eg health & education, directly impact on NI block grant & reg. framework Thu Apr 09 22:03:17 BST 2015

@sandswebb Happy to meet with you to discuss your concerns and talk about what we are doing to support public services. Thu Apr 09 19:35:07 BST 2015
@sandswebb Mental health is important & support more investment. Recognise the important role of comm & vol sector in delivery of service. Thu Apr 09 19:34:10 BST 2015
@Helikins @JudithCochrane @Chris_Lyttle Might be.  Maybe those were her curls. :D Thu Apr 09 19:30:57 BST 2015
@sandswebb Which services specifically are you concerned about? Thu Apr 09 19:23:57 BST 2015

@Peter_Kirkham @themerchent @neilwallis1 @Channel4News It's the only way to address it.  Power of compulsion isn't an option for the HIAI. Wed Apr 08 11:53:57 BST 2015
@Peter_Kirkham @themerchent @neilwallis1 @Channel4News Have been two, both less than satisfactory. NI Inquiry doesn't have required powers. Wed Apr 08 08:36:34 BST 2015
@WJProgressive I still owe you two answers!  I'll need to get that sorted tomorrow.  :) Tue Apr 07 21:24:54 BST 2015
@PentyJohn @KerriDunn @AlexKane221b Well, how else?  Whether you like it or not it was done by men and reduces choice. Those are just facts. Tue Apr 07 20:41:30 BST 2015
@PentyJohn @KerriDunn @AlexKane221b Surely men carving up which unionist they can vote for, denying them choice is what's patronising? Tue Apr 07 20:06:40 BST 2015
@EgertonSteven @PSNIBelfast Great.  They'll appreciate your help. Tue Apr 07 18:37:38 BST 2015
@EgertonSteven Thanks. @PSNIBelfast will be keen to know more from you. Theft & interference with electoral process are serious offences. Tue Apr 07 18:35:27 BST 2015

@JackTorney It will depend which party is delivering more of the Alliance manifesto. Mon Apr 06 20:44:52 BST 2015
@LarmourAndy Some issues are devolved, but simplifying benefits, better links to services, tailored support & patient passports would help Mon Apr 06 16:54:17 BST 2015
@cllrmck @yvetteshapiro @clionamccarney  What made you think I needed to calm down?  And you were judging families. Read your tweets. Mon Apr 06 14:00:04 BST 2015
@prodlegacy Never doubted it for a minute. :) Mon Apr 06 13:34:08 BST 2015
@cllrmck @yvetteshapiro @clionamccarney No-one's excited either "Calm down": the reply of first resort from some men if women express views Mon Apr 06 13:33:29 BST 2015
@prodlegacy Agreed on innocent/guilty issue. Anything that risks prosecution failing for the latter should be avoided.  Have a good Easter. Mon Apr 06 13:31:38 BST 2015
@prodlegacy Done. I want to ensure if anyone with a letter can be prosecuted, nothing the committee does prevents it. Mon Apr 06 13:06:49 BST 2015
@prodlegacy Legal advice that publication of names could prejudice any future prosecution.  All in the report. Mon Apr 06 13:05:51 BST 2015

@cllrmck @yvetteshapiro @clionamccarney "It takes a village to raise a child". Better to stop judging families & start supporting them. Mon Apr 06 11:59:22 BST 2015
@cllrmck @yvetteshapiro @clionamccarney A lot of the issues are down to stigma attached to nontraditional families, not families themselves. Mon Apr 06 11:59:18 BST 2015
@AllisonMorris1 Yep. I learned from my mum what courage and hard work really were. Mon Apr 06 11:53:36 BST 2015
@cllrmck @yvetteshapiro @clionamccarney Individuals aren't defined by rules. In a family, it's love & support that counts, not statistics. Mon Apr 06 11:35:59 BST 2015
@clionamccarney Dad died when I was 10. My mum did it alone. Lots of mums, dads, grandparents, fosterers & adoptive parents raise happy kids Mon Apr 06 11:15:45 BST 2015

@medianewspy @impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI No, don't think was for greater good or justified, however worthy the intent. Letters were wrong. Sun Apr 05 22:55:09 BST 2015

@impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI He doesn't. Specific case of a letter issued in error. Not known what effect other letters had/would have now. Sun Apr 05 18:51:25 BST 2015
@impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI It doesn't. Which you would know if you had read the report. Or cared about the issue. Sun Apr 05 18:43:30 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI @CregganDerry The rules are clear about casework. Sun Apr 05 18:41:34 BST 2015
@impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI I'm specifically not denying them justice. Oppose the letters & doing anything that could jeopardise prosecution. Sun Apr 05 18:35:24 BST 2015
@impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI No, they don't amount to an RPM. Seriously, stop trivialising an important issue. Read the report. Sun Apr 05 18:33:03 BST 2015
@impongo2 @JamieBrysonCPNI Most weren't given RPMs. If you had any interest in the issue, beyond an excuse to troll me, you'd know that. Sun Apr 05 18:17:19 BST 2015
@SadisticMark Then you haven't been paying attention. Check the website - it's all there. Sun Apr 05 16:58:04 BST 2015
@SadisticMark We have taken a strong position.  Check out my previous tweets and the statements on our website. Sun Apr 05 16:52:44 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI @RobertFleming71 Well, it's been raised then. Pointless as justice is devolved and the judiciary are independent. Sun Apr 05 16:47:58 BST 2015
@RobertFleming71 @JamieBrysonCPNI Parliamentary protocol is clear: must raise cases with own MP. Also barred from giving legal advice. Sun Apr 05 16:32:57 BST 2015
@WillJanice @JamieBrysonCPNI We didn't interfere, we held a parliamentary inquiry into a political scheme.  Entirely appropriate to do so. Sun Apr 05 16:30:32 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI I can't, no. You'd need to raise it with your own MP. Those are the rules. Sun Apr 05 16:29:20 BST 2015
@AMarkRamsey I'm not a gambler and the odds aren't as good as last time, but you could do worse. :) Sun Apr 05 16:25:22 BST 2015
@WillJanice @JamieBrysonCPNI Read the report. We took a different view to Hallett. Were wrong to issue them as interference with due process Sun Apr 05 16:17:50 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI No. I haven't said it's okay - I've said you need legal advice not political advice. Sun Apr 05 16:15:02 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI No. I'm not a solicitor or judge. Legal system should be free of political interference as you'll have read in the report. Sun Apr 05 16:06:28 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI No. Sun Apr 05 16:04:56 BST 2015
@JamieBrysonCPNI Because legal advice said that doing so could prejudice future prosecutions. Not to mention innocent 'til proven guilty. Sun Apr 05 15:46:37 BST 2015

@ttengineer When we're no longer able to make a positive difference in the Executive.  Until then, we're battling on the inside.  :) Fri Mar 27 22:17:27 GMT 2015
@ppdoddy @AshleyLeQuere Now that's quality! :D Fri Mar 27 22:16:04 GMT 2015
@Sineadmlarkin I think we can get something hopefully next week as I'm in Belfast full time now.  Apologies for today. Fri Mar 27 20:02:47 GMT 2015
@AllisonMorris1 @KateNicholl I ain't street enuff for dat, innit. Yo.  Or something.... Fri Mar 27 17:05:44 GMT 2015
@ciarakavv I'm doing well.  Hope Leeds is treating you well. x Fri Mar 27 17:04:39 GMT 2015
@KateNicholl Lol. How could it not?  Best insult ever. Fri Mar 27 17:01:45 GMT 2015
@JulieACorr Glad to amuse.  Many of them are unrepeatable.  Lol Fri Mar 27 16:45:02 GMT 2015
@WJProgressive Your comments are always most mannerly. :) Fri Mar 27 16:34:22 GMT 2015
For a bit of Friday afternoon fun, I decided to read some of the #MeanTweets I've recently received. #Naomi4East

@IwasApirate @allianceparty I have voted against TTIP including NHS services and am concerned at the general secrecy. Fri Mar 27 14:01:11 GMT 2015
@azuraNI1975 @allianceparty Messages aren't mixed. Fully in favour of equality but doesn't mean legal action is desirable resolution. Fri Mar 27 12:33:51 GMT 2015
@old_man_milford @allianceparty @Chris_Lyttle Have right to refuse, which carries with it duty to justify, the purpose of the court case. Fri Mar 27 12:32:03 GMT 2015
@WJProgressive @mofitzmaurice I don't have the volume to carry that off.....lol Fri Mar 27 11:53:34 GMT 2015
@DrVicSimms @basilmccrea @RoyalStatSoc I studied statistics for my engineering degree. :) Fri Mar 27 07:38:37 GMT 2015
@RamsayManbag @FrDMAckerman @PeterOuld @Ed_Miliband Lol. :D Fri Mar 27 00:47:36 GMT 2015
@RamsayManbag @FrDMAckerman @PeterOuld @Ed_Miliband Crocodiles will swallow almost anything but maybe not the notion of compassionate tories Fri Mar 27 00:29:23 GMT 2015
@RamsayManbag @FrDMAckerman @PeterOuld @Ed_Miliband It might be more entertaining than an average session of PMQs. :) Fri Mar 27 00:20:26 GMT 2015
@FrDMAckerman @PeterOuld @Ed_Miliband Not that complicated. We're looking for someone to run the country not wrestle a crocodile. Thu Mar 26 23:53:40 GMT 2015
@King_Ding_94 @Ed_Miliband I think it's character not personality which ought to be tested: that'll define the policies implemented. Thu Mar 26 22:45:18 GMT 2015
@John_Cooper_QC @Ed_Miliband I agree.  Came across much better than Cameron and handled the pressure with good humour and dignity. Thu Mar 26 22:41:43 GMT 2015
@FrDMAckerman @PeterOuld @Ed_Miliband No, a Prime Minister needs to be principled, resilient and intelligent.  That's what will count. Thu Mar 26 22:40:37 GMT 2015
@chunter88 @samwoodcock @Ed_Miliband Lol.  :) Thu Mar 26 22:38:21 GMT 2015
@Dont_Get_FUBAR If you give the office a call on 02890472004 tomorrow, we can check if it's adopted. Thu Mar 26 22:35:57 GMT 2015
@malodoherty Have to say, I agree.  Still think Miliband did better overall. Thu Mar 26 22:30:19 GMT 2015
Berating @Ed_Miliband for being a geek/not tough/not his brother smacks of school yard bullying. Handled with dignity. #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:27:42 GMT 2015
@soobadooba_boi That's a vote that wouldn't be delivering for NI. Thu Mar 26 22:23:33 GMT 2015
@JonnieMcC @SteveDonnan No normal person. Thu Mar 26 22:22:14 GMT 2015
@clairej1989 How come Kay Burley asked him supplementary questions but asked none of Cameron? Seemed a bit biased. Thu Mar 26 22:11:06 GMT 2015
@rcampbell1988 Thanks! Thu Mar 26 22:08:33 GMT 2015
@seatzie @NIWaterService The advice stated ground conditions and complications with works but it does seem extreme so we've sought more info Thu Mar 26 20:44:06 GMT 2015
@GazGuevara Yes @PaulaJaneB @pauis running in South. Thu Mar 26 20:17:14 GMT 2015
@belfastbarman @allianceparty @NICVA @BBCnireland @SluggerOToole I'm shamed now :( Thu Mar 26 20:14:27 GMT 2015
@StephenMcCullo4 There is an issue that unforeseen issues can extend works but this seems extreme. Thu Mar 26 20:13:17 GMT 2015
@WJProgressive @mofitzmaurice Never! Lol Thu Mar 26 20:12:18 GMT 2015
@belfastbarman @allianceparty @NICVA @BBCnireland @SluggerOToole Sadly, I had other commitments. Maybe next time. :) Thu Mar 26 20:03:36 GMT 2015
@WJProgressive @mofitzmaurice  Gi ma heid peace? :) Thu Mar 26 20:01:35 GMT 2015
@Tomkite69 I'mchecking with them: they've cited ground conditions & complications for delay. I'll have a better idea once I get full reply. Thu Mar 26 19:57:34 GMT 2015
@stevenpatt99 Problem for some is quite long diversion. I don't think many would complain if it was local access only, though :) Thu Mar 26 19:50:46 GMT 2015
@sid1882 I realise there's a problem with traffic speeds more generally - we've had a lot of complaints from residents about the diversion. Thu Mar 26 19:48:09 GMT 2015
If Tory deal gets DUP the Speaker that's 1 MP's vote which will matter as much as an abstentionist & less than mine. http://t.co/FLUhy0KXqv Thu Mar 26 19:35:45 GMT 2015
@my_cat_jeff It is. We've been in touch with NIW today to clarify why such a long extension. Thu Mar 26 18:22:55 GMT 2015
More disruption for residents & commuters with NIW extending Mersey Street closure until Dec. Contacted NIW for further info on overrun. Thu Mar 26 18:15:48 GMT 2015

@smythmark82 No problem :) Wed Mar 25 20:57:26 GMT 2015
@smythmark82 I see no compelling argument for a change at this time. Wed Mar 25 19:49:23 GMT 2015
@smythmark82 I assumed given the tone of the question you were simply being provocative rather than seeking an answer. Wed Mar 25 19:32:35 GMT 2015
@coatsey999 @AndrewMuirNI @EqualityCommNI How do you feel about >£40k spent by prev Health Min defending gay blood ban without evidence? 2/2 Wed Mar 25 19:20:04 GMT 2015
@coatsey999 @AndrewMuirNI @EqualityCommNI I'm not convinced it's the best test case either, but there is a point of law at stake. 1/2 Wed Mar 25 19:15:55 GMT 2015
@coatsey999 @AndrewMuirNI The @EqualityCommNI haven't backed no rights for Christians, have supported a test case which will clarify law Wed Mar 25 18:43:57 GMT 2015
@robojazz I can't be in Westminster today due to illness but support amdt & made case for tackling tax dodging &  transparency many times. Wed Mar 25 17:37:24 GMT 2015
@RonniNorvig Unfortunately, I'm not in Westminster today due to illness but I do support the amendment. Wed Mar 25 17:35:09 GMT 2015

@WJProgressive Awww. Shucks! Lol Tue Mar 24 23:36:19 GMT 2015
@unit2plus4 @allianceparty @SpotlightNI Me? Tue Mar 24 23:34:17 GMT 2015
@matthewcarson @SianAlliance Now?!  NOW??!!! Have we met?  Lol Tue Mar 24 23:11:31 GMT 2015
@bighilti No. The pardon stands.  Any other offence would be tried separately but the pardon means you are freed of the original conviction. Tue Mar 24 21:52:05 GMT 2015
@smythmark82 With regard to sitting on the fence? Tue Mar 24 19:38:07 GMT 2015
@bighilti It is, but a judge has said that the arrest was an abuse of process and stayed the trial.  Then no appeal was made by Govt. Tue Mar 24 19:37:15 GMT 2015
@bighilti The issue was Downey's letter was wrong and judge said it was an abuse of process. Won't know about others til case happens. Tue Mar 24 17:40:06 GMT 2015
@KateNicholl Lol!  Good for Kieran! Tue Mar 24 15:42:29 GMT 2015
@SteveDonnan All empty threats and bluster.  Why do people still fall for it? Tue Mar 24 14:42:52 GMT 2015
@SteveDonnan And the farm is still in Morrow hands while Castlereagh Council will soon be no more. Tue Mar 24 14:41:54 GMT 2015
@bighilti @BBCTalkback Precisely the point I made during inquiry. May not be illegal to advise not wanted but also telling people they were. Tue Mar 24 13:25:43 GMT 2015
@AratoOTeach @allianceparty They were.  Alasdair is a member of the Committee. Tue Mar 24 13:24:24 GMT 2015

@nws1886 @fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist Seriously?  Read the rest of the thread. I've been over this ground repeatedly. Tue Mar 24 00:13:07 GMT 2015
@rikmcbride @RationalPanic @DannyDonnelly1 @NI21official @apallan I speak for the party as Deputy Leader. Tue Mar 24 00:12:15 GMT 2015
@rikmcbride @RationalPanic @DannyDonnelly1 @NI21official @apallan We don't support the conscience clause? Tue Mar 24 00:11:15 GMT 2015
@nws1886 @fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist So am I. I just have a different view. Tue Mar 24 00:09:30 GMT 2015
@rikmcbride @RationalPanic @DannyDonnelly1 @NI21official @apallan @MrPJFloyd Not sure why I've been tagged, but I never sit on the fence. Mon Mar 23 23:53:34 GMT 2015
@nws1886 @fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist Also people in party who wish to remain in UK but all united that building shared future is priority Mon Mar 23 23:52:13 GMT 2015
@nws1886 @fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist She said in the long term it would be her preference. She still said her priority was a shared future Mon Mar 23 23:49:38 GMT 2015
@fergusonjanette @nws1886 @NI_Unionist I'm not. They can answer for themselves. Mon Mar 23 23:46:05 GMT 2015
@impongo2 @kmgwm @NI_Unionist SF are republicans, unionists are unionist. I don't define as either. Can't be straighter than that really. Mon Mar 23 23:34:40 GMT 2015
@bobbygawn @allianceparty Never has been & never will be for me. In reality, this election won't affect our constitutional position. Mon Mar 23 23:33:22 GMT 2015
@nws1886 @fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist It's an integral part of UK but unionist parties make it feel less like rest with regressive policies Mon Mar 23 23:31:55 GMT 2015
@fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist I don't think it is sectarian to support either position. Mon Mar 23 23:27:55 GMT 2015
@NI_Unionist @fergusonjanette I did answer.  It seems that people only accept an answer if it's the one they want to hear. Mon Mar 23 23:15:09 GMT 2015
@fergusonjanette @NI_Unionist And I never said otherwise. I answered, just not the way some want. Mon Mar 23 22:51:56 GMT 2015
@belfastjj @NI_Unionist @AlexKane221b Don't think saving the agreement was self interest. Public endorsed it & voted for us many times since Mon Mar 23 22:50:48 GMT 2015
@nornirongunner @NI_Unionist Well, then it's a good thing that they'll each have a vote on it before any change can be made. Mon Mar 23 22:20:46 GMT 2015
@AlexKane221b @belfastjj @NI_Unionist Lol.  She's begging you not to.... :D Mon Mar 23 22:13:19 GMT 2015
@nornirongunner @NI_Unionist My happiness isn't really tied to the union. Health, family & friends are more likely to affect it. Mon Mar 23 22:12:44 GMT 2015
@belfastjj @NI_Unionist @AlexKane221b No. I wasn't even elected then. Mon Mar 23 22:09:48 GMT 2015
@NIGruffalo @AlexKane221b No need. :) Mon Mar 23 21:16:56 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist Last vote on more devolution was corporation tax.  All NI parties supported it, for example. Mon Mar 23 20:01:00 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist Pro-devolution where practical & language issues devolved already: neither need divide on Uni/Nat lines. Mon Mar 23 19:59:54 GMT 2015
@Amonrosier UK doesn't have a constitution. Our constitutional position isn't decided at WM so as MP I have one vote on that, just like you. Mon Mar 23 19:47:44 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist Such as? Mon Mar 23 19:44:51 GMT 2015
@Amonrosier And on the constitution, the UK doesn't have a written one and I wouldn't be supportive of changing that. Mon Mar 23 19:44:30 GMT 2015
@Amonrosier It's not a cop out. It's a fact. And I've stated it over & over again. I reject binary politics & have consistently. Mon Mar 23 19:43:39 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist Not about ideology, about what's in best interest of NI. Settled in GFA & any change requires referendum. Mon Mar 23 19:35:13 GMT 2015
@ancientrome44 @NI_Unionist And that's her right.  I've given mine, too. Mon Mar 23 19:32:39 GMT 2015
@Amonrosier Actually, in this election, it isn't. It's settled & won't ever be decided at Westninster. Mon Mar 23 19:31:43 GMT 2015
@BillyBuckTeeth @NI_Unionist Agreed. Mon Mar 23 19:30:35 GMT 2015
@bobbygawn @allianceparty  Read our website http://t.co/svZifBDXLW.  Sets out clearly what we're for: not defined by this single question. Mon Mar 23 19:30:13 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist I'd have to see the business case for that, in terms of cost-benefit, as people can see TnaG. Mon Mar 23 19:26:59 GMT 2015
@windsorrocker @NI_Unionist I think I'd like to see the Assembly do something useful with the powers it has before devolving a lot more. Mon Mar 23 19:25:10 GMT 2015
@ancientrome44 @NI_Unionist I'm the same person with the same values, regardless of elections, & I've won quite a few with my current stance Mon Mar 23 19:24:14 GMT 2015
@NI_Unionist No. I've set out not to be pigeonholed and to express my views on my terms.  Important right in a democracy. Mon Mar 23 18:19:02 GMT 2015
@NI_Unionist As I just set out. Mon Mar 23 18:14:11 GMT 2015

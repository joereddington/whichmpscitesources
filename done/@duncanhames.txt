@HD2onPBdotcom Perhaps, but a lot more expensive too. We already have operational track and station for this rail service.
@freudianskippy Exactly. It's foolish to think either the council or the government will pay for a station without trains that would stop.

@twitknacker I've no progress to report, but Danny Alexander says @hmtreasury are working on an international deal to tackle tax avoidance.
@twitknacker We should. I'm not at that event, but I raised tax avoidance when speaking at another one last night with the City of London.

@TractorGirl66 Electrification should help fit services like this into the timetable, but we'll have to get Didcot's western curve done too.
@charlesmaggs Yes: John Howells, Nicola Blackwood & Ed Vaizey all signed up. Lord Bill Bradshaw from your area has been hugely  supportive.
@RebetikoWalrus No. The speeches today set out what the Tories would do if they weren't in coalition with the Ljb Dems. Things we stopped!
@RebetikoWalrus Yes. The use of six planes is a modest contribution to an international response to a country's request to aid it's defence.

@aligoldsworthy thanks to you and Doug for your help this weekend!
@talktellme I can, among other countries, but better to make it safe again for them to stay in the country which was their home.
@VinylTiger I see. Autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan had appeared to be doing well, but recent troubles with Baghdad have left it defenceless.
@talktellme It is indeed a disaster. I welcome the PM's recent response: genocide must be prevented.
@VinylTiger Do you have in mind a Kurdish state carved exclusively from Iraq or a wider area?
@VinylTiger The world has a responsibility to prevent genocide, and give humanitarian assistance to those seeking refuge from violence.

@GarySpedding Thanks.
@GarySpedding please mention them to me again, I couldn't follow all the conversation between you both.
@nakedvix ...which failed on both counts, but was edited from the final broadcast.
@nakedvix Sure. I said that policy should promote inclusion and a complete curriculum. I also cited a case from the independent sector...

@chrisstacey1 You're welcome. The wall of sound at PMQs is even greater when standing in the midst of it, but I persevere.
@VinylTiger Not happening.
@nakedvix You exaggerate my comments. The point I was making, illustrated by primary schools in Wiltshire is variation across the country.

@HiHelloItChloe Please do. It helps my office prioritise messages from people who live in my constituency.
@timmytapper you're welcome. Sadly, we've had a bit of practice with this sort of thing.
@stevenorris123 you have a point: even if voters don't want simple politicians, they would like us to communicate complex issues simply.
@sarahiweld I haven't seen it yet, but please email duncan@duncanhames.org.uk and I'll try to get some more information for you.
@sarahiweld ...a further 'short' consultation. I anticipate that this will be about how, not whether, to introduce plain packs regulation.
@sarahiweld the public health minister gave a statement to Parliament essentially accepting the case for plain packaging, and announcing...
@eberlin a perceptive analysis. Do voters really take as much interest in this kind of soap opera as political journalists do?
@dlknowles expanding the area would give the substantial residents' discount to many more people, unless you introduce multiple zones.
@KateMrsnash I agree. More common however, are truths not said. When did any politician last promise you higher taxes, NI, or energy bills?
@KateMrsnash Yes. We've all been guilty of that. Do people vote for what they don't want to hear, I wonder?
@ShaneMcC I'm doing some work on this at the moment. Our autumn conference will debate, and may amend, our pre-manifesto platform.
@ShaneMcC Agree. Others have a habit of pinching the best ones (personal allowance, mansion tax) - which is a good thing really!
@KatharineOatley Sensible suggestion. I'll certainly try. Thanks.
@ShaneMcC Like some of these perhaps, or simpler still? http://t.co/QDGc3yeNBG c/o @markpack
@LondonEconomic @lucaschris or this for the whole of the UK. http://t.co/6Ee4Q4j6dU
@KatharineOatley Fair enough. What policies would you like them to pursue? How can we inspire good people to enter politics themselves?
@ShaneMcC Thanks. Lots to digest there: both in terms of policy and how we do political campaigns. OK if I reply with more in the morning?
@ShaneMcC Thanks. Now to work on finding some answers... Do you have any suggestions?
@KatharineOatley You + many others. Was it because you didn't know the people you were able to vote for, or you did but didn't want any?
@Woodygems Good point. Some work is being done on finding those not registered, but that won't of itself persuade them it's worth voting.
@KateMrsnash Yes. Convince the electorate, not just urge or compel them. Is it clear what's at stake for people when they choose our MEPs?
@JaredLarusso Thanks. Sadly, good people in all parties are quitting politics, which itself will only make it harder to reverse this trend.
@spence01 Exactly. Good points. Voters like to be able to vote for people, not just parties or party lists. We all have to raise our game.
@spence01 I hear you. I believe we are better off in Europe, engaged, +stood up for that. Some would call this 'out of touch'! Did you vote?
@Martinned81 @demsoc Similar. I don't say that's the answer to either. Surely people need to be able to see the difference their vote makes?
@seanlibdem Unfortunately, I don't think that would address the root of the situation.

@EnergyBillRev are you expecting MPs to commit all these revenues to this today? Is it £4billion/year? What do they get spent on currently?

@kezziakemp @FGW I'd be happy to write a supporting letter for your appeal if you email the details to me at duncan@duncanhames.org.uk.
@g_denham please email details of these problems to me at duncan@duncanhames.org.uk so I can write to their management about it for you.
@g_denham government has limited the increase this year, but agree they're never welcome. Can you remember when last the fare rise was less?
@janeparenting Thanks. Where is the launch? Please send the invite to me at duncan@duncanhames.org.uk. Good luck with it!
@KateMrsnash Looks a good campaign, but can't make pledges on pay this far ahead. Have your say in our manifesto here http://t.co/4nwIeB5ewY
@veronicavmh That's a shame. Is there anything you would be interested in reading about in a future letter, which perhaps would?
Very grateful to the wonderful team of midwives who helped deliver our son – really proud of Jo & am enjoying getting to know Andrew. #fb
@ibrahimtaguri Congratulations! I'm sure you'll give it your all. Wishing you very best of luck on your campaign.
@enjaybeeassoc I set out here: http://t.co/KLFM0V6YBQ why a price freeze would actually help the big six energy companies avoid competition.
@KateMrsnash We need to help businesses create jobs, help people gain skills, and raise them on to genuinely living wages.
@greglovelluk there is a place for community initiative alongside the welfare state. Sometimes bureaucracy is too slow to give support.
@SVPhillimore I don't know the facts of this case, but would make enquiries for you if you email me in the office: duncan@duncanhames.org.uk
@greglovelluk I said that many people could have done with them earlier - which is true.
@KateMrsnash there was no option to only vote for that part of the motion and not it all. I agree the conduct of the debate was atrocious.
@LauraAPitman I have visited the Melksham foodbank. We need to help businesses create jobs, and then raise people on to living wages.
@spence01 I did attend the debate. I tried to speak earlier, but eventually an MP gave way to me: http://t.co/6BWl3tzb5k
@spence01 I have been to the Melksham foodbank and spoken privately with the volunteers there. I'm glad the community responds to this need.
@ShaneMcC the motion called for more than just a foodbanks study. It also required me to support their energy policy - which won't work.

@RowQuantrill At least the carbon floor price wasn't dropped this week as speculated on in that article. That should see these off anyway.
@adamczuk I understand James. I'm just trying to do what I can to make a positive difference myself, that list is getting longer.
@adamczuk Evidence from the pilots of universal free school meals show that it improves educational attainment across the board.
@adamczuk Lots of children entitled to free school meals currently miss out, and others whilst ineligible are in low income households.
@adamczuk Really? Thatcher broke the earnings link for pensions + axed school milk. We restored the link + give infants free school meals.
@DC_Banks You're welcome David. Thank you for coming, and for your contribution to our discussions.

@PaulStreeting How awful. I look forward to the re-tendering of this contract. It's hard to see how Atos could hang on to it.
@PaulStreeting I could certainly write to the Minister for you, if you could email me in the office about it.

@SteveReckless The graduate should be protected from any changes to the terms of their payments, i.e. no changes to the interest charges.
@PaulTreacyLFC How awful! I didn't get much out of the council, but am chasing them again to take it seriously in light of this.

@Hayleystevens affordable homes, we need to make the best use we can of the existing social housing stock.
@Hayleystevens Yes. Too often I have young families in my constituency surgery living in over-crowded accomodation. Until we have more ...

@undomgoddess I'd like to see empty homes brough back into use; we should help councils work with their owners. We will need new homes too.
@spence01 It doesn't. We should do more: funding home energy efficiency, creating more jobs, and promoting living wages would all help.
@undomgoddess Until we build more homes we need to make best use of the social housing stock. I also support constituent's DHP applications.
@greglovelluk No not neat. I also support DHP applications for people who need the space. I have to work as best I can with what's possible.
@cullen_paula We secured Discretionary Housing Payments for those who need to stay where they are. These ought to last as long as needed.
@spence01 That's why we help with £135 Warm Homes Discount, paid for with some of the so called 'green taxes' that others want scrapped.
@spence01 There isn't, so less housing benefit should go to those who have more room than they need, so that those without may have more.
@spence01 Extra money for schools teaching pupils from the poorest families. Taking the low paid out of income tax. Funding apprenticeships.
@RebetikoWalrus Yes. Fascism?
@greglovelluk I've met them in my constituency surgeries: one week I saw a lady wanting help to downsize, and then a dad needing more rooms.
@Sy_Rawlings Thanks for your tweets - much appreciated. Your side of this story needs to be heard too. Do you live in Chippenham?
@doorwayproject I also help constituents who can't move apply for Discretionary Housing Payments: much increased since policy first proposed
@cullen_paula ...until then, we still need to make better use of the social housing stock.
@cullen_paula I frequently have local tenants from overcrowded homes at my constituency surgeries. We needed more home long ago...
@doorwayproject Lisa, I have too many tenants at my constituency surgeries living in overcrowded homes. Someone has to care about them too.

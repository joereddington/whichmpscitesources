@AndyD_Newman That's not what he said. Don't be so defeatist! Sat Apr 25 19:27:54 BST 2015
@RaySomerset I don't think that's what he said. It sounds to be like he's knocking the SNP out of any post-election negotiations. Sat Apr 25 19:26:21 BST 2015

@VinylTiger Indeed. Later would be fine. Mon Apr 20 09:56:50 BST 2015
@VinylTiger What would be the point in that? Mon Apr 20 09:49:16 BST 2015
@VinylTiger There is a chance in all honesty, but far from the most likely outcome. Circumstances in 2010 were extraordinary. Mon Apr 20 09:44:42 BST 2015
@VinylTiger I thought Nick's comments and mine were about the circumstances in which we would work with Labour. Mon Apr 20 09:05:21 BST 2015
@VinylTiger You're right that no other majority government could be formed after the result last time. Mon Apr 20 09:04:34 BST 2015
@VinylTiger I think you'll find we are proposing taxes on the wealthiest that Labour have never done: http://t.co/HDy62C70gP Mon Apr 20 07:48:23 BST 2015

@DariusMehta Shouldn't the practice of our democracy be more important than narrow party self-interest? Thu Apr 16 20:44:56 BST 2015
@sarahclapton I agree. The broadcasters did not invite @nick_clegg  to this debate. See: http://t.co/H0PpmMy2b9 Thu Apr 16 20:43:39 BST 2015
@DariusMehta I believe that democracy requires a free press. It was a disgrace that the PM attempted to dictate terms to the media. Thu Apr 16 20:40:18 BST 2015

@DariusMehta If it is a wise decision for David Cameron to escape scrutiny, that is very telling. Thu Apr 16 20:35:55 BST 2015
@DariusMehta What's your assessment of David Cameron's decision not to be there? Thu Apr 16 20:30:25 BST 2015
@tomstranks5 I agree. We have to accept the broadcasters' decision, but David Cameron could have gone along with the original proposal. Thu Apr 16 20:29:25 BST 2015

@Tariq182 Sure. We didn't win so had to compromise. As did Tories who didn't want any fee limit at all. Fees rose along with new bursaries. Thu Apr 16 18:19:13 BST 2015
@chrsfrwll Any concerns or questions I could address to help you decide? Wed Apr 15 21:33:16 BST 2015
@followthehatMND That's concerning. Have you spoken to @wiltshirepolice or @PCCWiltsSwindon? Wed Apr 15 14:51:04 BST 2015
@followthehatMND Throwing that kind of abuse around won't reflect well on your team's candidate. Perhaps you'd like to ask my neighbours? Wed Apr 15 14:49:22 BST 2015
@HillsWaste @HillsGroup it was good to meet you. I'm delighted to see what a wonderful home for learning the pre-school now has. Fantastic! Wed Apr 15 14:41:16 BST 2015

@ThatMichaelW "The election is a close race between local Lib Dem Duncan Hames and the Conservatives." Anyway, great to see you doing well. Thu Apr 09 22:21:10 BST 2015
@ThatMichaelW You're right to say he was asked why my leaflet didn't mention the party - which was odd, because it did: over a dozen times. Thu Apr 09 22:18:21 BST 2015

@alanmacrae Holt was in the old Westbury constituency, and Chippenham too, of course. Mon Mar 23 21:00:55 GMT 2015
@alanmacrae Just one before living in Holt, and I have been here for 12 years. No-one would have had reason to doubt your local credentials. Mon Mar 23 20:59:35 GMT 2015

@seandilley #Camerband surely? Sat Mar 21 20:17:21 GMT 2015
@KateMrsnash I understand. I may have won here last time, but fewer than 1 in 10 MPs are Lib Dems, so the Government won't do all we want. Sat Mar 21 08:10:47 GMT 2015
@KateMrsnash I'm the only Wiltshire MP who voted for the Affordable Homes Bill to stop people having no choice but to pay the 'bedroom tax'. Sat Mar 21 08:07:22 GMT 2015
@KateMrsnash If the Tories had been in a majority, they would have allowed companies to run schools for profit, and brought in regional pay. Sat Mar 21 08:03:47 GMT 2015
@tracywakeley Yes. NHS leaders say it needs an extra £8 billion a year by 2020. All politicians should commit to finding the money for it. Sat Mar 21 07:54:52 GMT 2015
@Sy_Rawlings Glad to hear it. Was it Ken he introduced you to perhaps? Sat Mar 21 07:49:01 GMT 2015

@libdemvoice With the other parties campaigning in only a little over 600 constituencies, that could really give us the edge! ;-) Tue Mar 17 10:55:42 GMT 2015
@ShaneMcC I gather we would seek cross-party agreement to an annual 3% real terms increase in public funding for science for next 15 years. Mon Mar 16 21:48:18 GMT 2015
@CorshamResident We disagree, but at least you know where I stand. Do you know if the other candidates support the Hunting Act? Mon Mar 16 19:19:09 GMT 2015
@ShaneMcC Sounds sensible. I know we've made some fresh commitments to expenditure on innovation as well. Let me check and get back to you. Sat Mar 14 21:32:34 GMT 2015
@ShaneMcC Looks like a good campaign. How soon realistically do you think an increase to 0.8% can be achieved? Sat Mar 14 14:04:48 GMT 2015

@LocalRachel Thanks. I have followed you so you can message me a telephone number, and we can have a chat about it if you like. Fri Mar 13 13:51:37 GMT 2015
@TelePolitics Great interview, but in that case, why hasn't he said so himself? Fri Mar 13 08:57:20 GMT 2015
@civic_voice Not possible unfortunately, I will be in Wiltshire. I hope you enjoy conference! Thu Mar 12 20:44:09 GMT 2015
@CorshamResident The Coalition has a majority, but on a free vote I think the majority of MPs would vote to keep the Hunting Act. Thu Mar 12 20:41:38 GMT 2015
Appearing on @bbcpointswest later tonight to talk about the idea job-share candidates for MPs. What do you think? Thu Mar 12 20:22:34 GMT 2015
@DomGoacher Thanks for reading. You're right: we need to tighten up the production process. I hope you'll still back the Urgent Care Centre. Tue Mar 10 22:35:16 GMT 2015
@CommonCapitaI Yes, I have done. I will do what I can to support the social economy in the next Parliament. Tue Mar 10 22:31:52 GMT 2015
@FrackFreefamily @NoNukeDumping it's a lengthy process still, but the Commons has agreed that it will be a NSIP under the 2008 Planning Act Tue Mar 10 18:50:45 GMT 2015

@blackorchid100 Glad you liked it. We will have to tighten-up the production process. Don't forget to support the Urgent Care Centre! Tue Mar 10 17:17:06 GMT 2015

@wiltscouncil Just seen again today: two vans, on pavement, across double yellows, on a school route. Can anything  be done? @BookwormVaught Fri Mar 06 09:51:21 GMT 2015
@fredswiltshire Likewise. I'd be delighted to... just after Easter. :-) Thu Mar 05 22:19:12 GMT 2015
@PaulTreacyLFC @BBCWiltshire Very true. I was calling for a new rail service, we already have the track. Thu Mar 05 16:14:47 GMT 2015
@AndrewGazette We don't know yet, but we'll know later this month. I've pushed this to the very last. Thu Mar 05 12:53:53 GMT 2015
@AndrewGazette I've been calling for service improvements in the new franchise, including a local service from Bristol to Swindon or Oxford. Thu Mar 05 12:37:47 GMT 2015

Anticipating a Commons vote to authorise c.£300bn of public spending from next month. Most of that in a single resolution. Tue Mar 03 18:59:22 GMT 2015
@AndrewGazette @Savewiltsmusic I certainly have. Our Lib Dem councillors went one better, and voted against the budget cuts at County Hall. Tue Mar 03 09:44:00 GMT 2015
@adamninetyeight All we can do: shame the Council's leadership into reversing their decision. The petition's momentum is impressive. Mon Mar 02 19:18:15 GMT 2015
@adamninetyeight Local LibDem cllrs proposed a budget to stop the cuts, instead raise council tax by 1.9%, and save Wiltshire Music Service. Mon Mar 02 08:13:21 GMT 2015

@colinwforster @MattChorley If he had, one of us would have been available to provide cover, I'm sure. Mon Feb 23 21:41:45 GMT 2015
@IsabelHardman Surely the programme motion will have to be dropped? The first 'knives' were set to fall at 5.15pm. Mon Feb 23 16:16:54 GMT 2015

@chrsfrwll I don't understand. Are you saying the poll I linked to is wrong, or that I was misrepresenting it? Thu Feb 19 07:31:01 GMT 2015
@VinylTiger That's where the legislative dilemma rests, I grant you. Still not sure. Wed Feb 18 22:49:35 GMT 2015
@VinylTiger What we're both grappling with is the context that some people today still think that a girl is not worth raising. That's awful. Wed Feb 18 22:46:54 GMT 2015
@VinylTiger Still thinking on it. In practice, doesn't 'sex-selection' cut right across the idea that men and women are different but equal? Wed Feb 18 22:38:17 GMT 2015

@YasminNatashaB Yes. Even though free wifi had already been agreed for the Great Western franchise before this announcement. Mon Feb 16 16:30:47 GMT 2015
@YasminNatashaB so I'd say it was only fair that it be given back to hard-pressed rail passengers in an improved service. #fareenough Mon Feb 16 16:11:34 GMT 2015
@YasminNatashaB It works out as 3p per journey for a year. Importantly, the money first came from passengers, paid by the industry in fines. Mon Feb 16 16:09:21 GMT 2015

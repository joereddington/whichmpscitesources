Following on yesterday's #devodebate today we have the absolute joy of Scottish Questions
Well that is several hours of my life I won't get back again #devodebate
@LJ_Skipper @Ed_Miliband ..... Or even where Ed is ....
So Brown just said didn't know about EVEL prior to Referendum - so much for the Vow - they had no agreement on what "vowing" #the45andrising
Lab refusing to take interventions from SNP members - not surprised this is shocking mince. #the45andrising
This is dire - Labour digging a big hole for themselves on both sides of the border #the45andrising
Oh dear Labour spokesperson really struggling here. Position really is do anything to ensure Scot Lab MPs can still vote on Eng matters.
This has more to do with the next General Election inEngland rather than powers for Scotland #the45andrising
@MoirIV spent a whole 13 mins on Scotland - more interested in EVEL #the45andrising
Tory interventions on EVEL - plans heading for the rocks already #the45andrising
Voted in favour of private members bill to exempt carers from Bedroom Tax. Unlikely to make progress unfortunately.
Debate on the "vow" today. Huge cracks already in Unionist front - how many concentrate on EVEL today?

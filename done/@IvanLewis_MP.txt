@DanielFine4 you are absolutely right to be concerned re terrible  attack on the Yazidi people by Isis. Essential our Govt offers support.
@Peter_Kirkham Legislation exists which gives police power to apply restrictions on specified grounds. No special treatment required.
@MarkLewisLawyer Thanks Mark. Always good to have a top lawyer on your side. Especially when not paying!Hope life is treating you well.
@Peter_Kirkham please don't quote me out of context. I tweeted  large scale demos  and referred to other locations being more suitable.
Size of weekend demonstrations  intimidate KEDEM staff + customers +neighbouring shops. Not acceptable to target shop owned by Jewish people
There are other totally suitable locations in City centre Manchester where those who feel strongly on all sides can hold mass demos.
To be clear I said the right to demonstrate is sacrosanct. But k
#Street and Market street not suitable locations for large scale demos.
About  time @gmpolice banned large scale demonstrations on King Street +Market street. They are intimidatory. Other locations more suitable.
@TheFrankHindle Totally agree Frank. But targeting Jewish owned shops and in some cases lauding Hitler is.
@OwenJones84  Thanks.In Mcr we have demos specifically targeting Jewish owned businesses. Rt to demonstrate sacrosanct but this isn't right.
Massive respect for @SirRichardLeese + Mcr for speaking out against anti semitism at this time. Distressing so many on left silent or worse.

@rmg1011 Please feel free to contact my office tomorrow and ask us to make representations to council re improving street lighting.
@rmg1011 Yes and they were put there following petitions etc from local residents demanding traffic calming measures. Sometimes, can't win!
@rmg1011 All large public +private sector orgs waste money to some extent. But overall Bury is run well in very challenging circumstances.
@rmg1011 re bumps and narrowing side roads that's usually because local residents ask for these measures to improve safety.

I understand peoples concerns re Bury councils proposals to change bin collection arrangements. Read my full response http://t.co/g3UZ2tj44H
@carolinejmolloy Disingenuous  to blame personalisation  for cuts. Many parts of adult services where no p budgets also being decimated.
@carolinejmolloy Savage cuts being made in most LA areas across most depts inc the v majority where there is no personalisation agenda!!
@carolinejmolloy  Have you met people whose lives have been transformed by personal budgets? If not, are you prepared to do so?
“@carolinejmolloy:  @cpeedell   NHS/LA silos blight lives of so many. This is excellent way of tackling this without organisational upheaval
“@carolinejmolloy:  @cpeedell  integrated P budgets bringing together NHS + LA funding streams not yet been tried. Why not test them out?
@cpeedell I believe in peoples right to self determination + maximum control  over  own life inc when sick/disabled. Choice not a  panacea.
@cpeedell Personal budgets should always be accompanied by support from a lead professional. Poor implementation doesn't make concept wrong.
@cpeedell Simon Stephens proposing areas  wanting  to test integrated personal budgets  be allowed to do so. Not imposing across country.
@cpeedell objective?!! Labours record lowest waiting times ever, record nos of Drs and nurses, unprecedented patient satisfaction.
@cpeedell I also believe in giving people maximum control over their own lives inc when their needs mean they require state support.
@cpeedell I believe in evidence based policy. But policy evaluation must be carried out by objective researchers without axe to grind.
@cpeedell Why don't you meet some of these people and hear for yourself?
@cpeedell You dismiss many peoples testimonies as to how personal budgets have transformed their lives as anecdotes! (1)
@carolinejmolloy The right to self determination and retain maximum control over ones own life should be available to the many not the few.
@JamesAnthonyRN The right to self determination and retain maximum control over ones own life should be available to the many not the few.
@carolinejmolloy It is this Tory led  Govt's savage cuts to Local council budgets not personalisation which has affected peoples support.
@JamesAnthonyRN I accept the implementation of agenda inc Personal budgets in some LA areas has been awful. That doesn't make concept wrong.
@JamesAnthonyRN It is this Tory led Govt that are responsible for savage cuts to LA adult care budgets not the Personalisation agenda!
@carolinejmolloy  your comment re sound bite v unfair. Have you met some of the many people whose lives have been transformed by p budgets?
@carolinejmolloy If people are given control over spending,choices much more cost effective. But you are rt doesn't deal with underfunding.
@JamesAnthonyRN Pooling resources in a single budget is excellent way to shatter silos between services which so many people complain about.
@JamesAnthonyRN  Where personal budgets have been implemented properly they have transformed peoples lives.
@carolinejmolloy Currently, the rt to have your own budget+determine how it is spent to meet your needs is only available to wealthy people.
@1AnneMcCormack I would love you to meet the people whose lives have been transformed by personal budgets when properly implemented.
@1AnneMcCormack Putting NHS and LA resources in one budget attached to the person/ family is integration without organisational upheaval.
@1AnneMcCormack Every individual/ family should have named lead professional able  to assist with use of personal budget if required.
@1AnneMcCormack The right to have your own budget +determine how it is spent to  meet your needs is currently only available to the wealthy.
@1AnneMcCormack So people can't be trusted to spend their budgets wisely but organisations can?! That is a very paternalistic view of people
@1AnneMcCormack A single personal budget  enables people to have integrated NHS and council support without organisational restructuring.
@1AnneMcCormack  you are totally wrong about this Anne. It is very exciting and exactly what Labour means by people powered public services.
@SarahAwtp That sounds dreadful. Are you a constituent? Can I help in any way?
@rmg1011 Hi Robbie, you raise a really important issue. There have been too many tragedies. I will see what can be done.

@timothy_stanley Disraeli wasn't an atheist Jew he converted to Christianity!
One Nation Labour clearly worries thoughtful people on right.
@paulcsansom @timothy_stanley  Like Ed many Jews are proud of their ethnicity and culture but are atheists. They do not adopt a new faith.
@timothy_stanley Only someone with a political agenda or warped view of the world could suggest Ed's comments were an affront to Disraeli!

@concernedofmcr People will get vote if any further transfer of power from Uk to Eu. In meantime,we will fight for changes to Eu people want
Great to be at wonderful @rushanaraalis fundraising dinner on her birthday. Rush just confirmed she's not 50, not 40. In her 30s. Jealous!
No transfer of powers from UK to EU without in/out EU referendum says @Ed_Miliband in @FT .  This is real leadership in national interest.
Real honour to greet Taoiseach  @EndaKennyTD on his visit to our great city of Manchester. http://t.co/oBGl1AuPJD
What a let down City! 1st half  no better than last year's FA cup final. Wigan deserved to win. They out fought us + Uwe out thought us.
Great news: Nick Clegg to stay Lib Dem leader until 2020 irrespective of election results. The nation rejoices! What planet are they on?!
Northern Lib Dems critique of their party and Tories demonstrates only Labour can be one nation party this country needs. #onenationlabour
After 4 yrs Northern Lib Dem MPs suddenly discover their Govt is treating North badly!Anything to do with fact they face electoral wipeout?!
Listen to my NewStatesman podcast interview with @rafaelbehr re @UKLabour offer at next election https://t.co/IhzZH2T5zt”
One final reflection re Capital One Cup final.Sportsmanship of @SAFCofficial fans was fantastic. Leaving Wembley they applauded City fans.
"Let's get behind National Apprenticeship Week, set up by @UKLabour in office to help support our young people to get on #NAW2014”
@KathMBrom 46 yrs. 1st match at Maine Road in 1973. Have had season tickets for yrs.Hair went prematurely grey cos of City not politics!!
Great 2nd half performance by City. Two world class goals. Sunderland deserve lot of credit for positive football. 1 trophy down, 3 to go!
@Markfergusonuk  May the best team win. Providing its City of course!
@petewolfe1 That would be great Pete. Do you mind calling my office on 773 5500 to arrange a mutually convenient meeting?
Today's historic changes would never have been possible without the negotiating skills of my friend @lord_collins http://t.co/hWTs12SKDp
Great to be at Excel with fav colleagues @rushanaraali @marycreagh_mp and @JaneLBlack and star of show @lord_collins http://t.co/eZIAmirYpD
John Hannett leader of Usdaw4Labour nails it. Successful Movements are those willing to change. That's how Usdaw gained 100000 new members.
Inspirational speech by former MP Ian McCartney. Let us return to a country run by ordinary people who want to do extraordinary things.
Excellent speech from @Mandytelford Why shouldn't lots more people have wonderful experience of canvassing in the rain?! #onenationpolitics
Great speech from @PhilWilsonMP Come on Dave, when are you going to come clean about how the Tory party is funded. #specialconference
Historic day for Labour +politics in Uk. @Ed_Milibands strong leadership changing our party so we can change our country.#specialconference
Today, @Ed_Miliband is showing Labour is serious about building a new, better politics. Time for Cameron to do the same. #specialconference
Historic day for Labour+ politics in Uk. @Ed_Milibands strong leadership changing our party so we can change our country.#onenationpolitics
@jennieplattltd  I hope you mean row of offices rather than argument!! Great that work is progressing.
Dennis Turner was wise counsel+ great support to many young MPs such as myself in early days.He loved his constituency,will be sorely missed
Important story on @peacecentre in Mail on Sunday. Cameron must fix this. Pls RT http://t.co/pddFXAzgtR”
Many congrats to John Mallon for doing what no one before him has managed. Making Trees Estate safer.http://t.co/9zaaK1YqKc @LoveWhitefield
@itsrach1 Radcliffe getting three quarter of million pounds to create new market plus number of other schemes I'm happy to send you details.
@richardbaum Are you aware of cost of living crisis facing vast majority of people?
Extraordinary hypocrisy from @timpickstone in saying he shares Labour's concerns at cuts to Bury council's budget.Cuts imposed by his Govt!
@richardbaum Hi Richard, hope you are well.
It would be better if you acknowledged 50% cuts being imposed by your Govt are devastating.
Labour announce half a million pounds new capital investment in Prestwich village. Rightly praise @JaneLBlack+Prestwich Lab cllrs for work.
At Bury T Hall: In 2015/16 council face more than 14% cuts in budget imposed by Tory led Govt.This will mean a horrendous 50% cut in 4 yrs.
Excellent day visiting Radcliffe childrens' centres. Thanks to the efforts of staff  the activities in these centres have been transformed.
Amidst chatter from Westminster village to be clear @UKLabour sole focus is  an overall majority. Coalition not delivered good or fair Govt.
@WillLeitch  Manchester to Belfast flight can be very rowdy on occasions. Especially when fellow passengers find out I'm a Man City fan!!
@alijhardy That's really kind Alison. Hope you are well.
Delighted to have arrived safely in Northern Ireland. Packed day of meetings tomorrow starting with leaders of 4 main churches in Armagh.
@RobertKisyula Great to hear from you. How are you? How are things in Eastern DRC? How's the politics progressing?
Great to be with wonderful  Radcliffe and Whitefield Lions at their afternoon tea dance  for senior citizens. Lots of fun and I danced!
Cameron's project was big society, tackling climate change+support in North would detoxify nasty party brand.
All have failed. What is left?
From @Daybreak - Strong byelection result-vindication of Labour's focus on #CostOfLivingCrisis impacting UK families

Labour put the #CostofCameron in the Harlow spotlight (interview with me and  @Suzy4Harlow ) http://t.co/ec3qCrDugH via @yourharlow”
Great AM campaigning with brilliant @suzy4harlow + her wonderful team exposing #costofcameron.Very positive feedback on @labourdoorstep.
Paul Goggins was an exceptional MP +minister. More importantly an exceptional man. Integrity, wisdom, humility, compassion loyalty. RIP Paul
The special impact Paul Goggins had on all who knew him has been demonstrated by the expressions of grief+respect at Westminster today.
@clionamccarney  Thank you. Very kind from someone who supports the wrong Manchester club !
@t_acomb  Thanks for everything Tara.
You did a great job and will be missed. Best wishes with the new challenges which lie ahead.
Very concerned to hear news about Paul Goggins. One of most decent, committed people I know in any walk of life. Praying for his recovery.
#Haass: Failure to agree deeply disappointing. But stalemate can't  stand.Enough common ground to find way forward. http://t.co/9UQOfIHtlo”
Great win for City. Kind of result that matters at end of season.
Moses has just come on at the Etihad. Will he stop Jesus ending up on the winning team this Boxing Day?!
The Beast! 2-1 City. What a way to end a brilliant 1st half of world class football.
Kompany. Game on!
Electric Boxing Day atmosphere at the ETIHAD. Fingers crossed within  48 hrs a Manchester club will be back at the top of Premiership!
Merry Christmas +best wishes for a happy 2014. Special thanks to those providing support to sick, lonely or vulnerable people this Xmas.
@IvanLewisNI Haass talks, failure to reach agreement disappointing. N Ireland politicians+ 2 Govt's must give @RichardHaass reason to return
Haass: Lets hope political leaders find a way thru remaining areas of contention. NI needs an agreement as building block to better future.”
@LucyMPowell is one of the hardest working MPs I know and a brilliant role model for parents balancing work and family life.
Last nights bomb in Belfast was cowardly.Those responsible will not be allowed to derail peace process.Sec service +police did excellent job
@tombrookspolloc My views on MPs pay are crystal clear. Read today's Bury Times.
@newyearsdayboy Sentence seems harsh when considering trauma and stress caused by serving on the frontline. But I haven't seen the evidence.
@newyearsdayboy Because a court of law found he was not doing his job but committed a cold blooded killing which could not be justified.
@SmallBizSatUK been huge success.Highlighting importance of small businesses to economy +communities.Congrats to@ChukaUmunna for great idea.
@SmallBizSatUK today - I have been visiting local businesses in Bury with@jimmyfrith including @InfinitiesStores http://t.co/CLV738WSHl”
RIP Nelson Mandela. For my generation you were the greatest leader of them all. You chose reconciliation and hope over revenge and fear.
@JanetWilliams99 Would love to get home eventually! Via public meeting about new school in my constituency.
Now stuck at Macclesfield. Rumour is another tree has fallen on line. Things can only get better!
Train finally left Stoke. Travelling restricted speed for some of way. Hope to be at Piccadilly for 720 then heading straight to  Radcliffe.

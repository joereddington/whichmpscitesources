Great feedback for the  wonderful @LizMcInnesMP on #labourdoorstep in Bamford today. Liz is an excellent champion for Middleton and Heywood. Sun Apr 26 18:23:05 BST 2015
Honoured  to be at GALLIPOLI 100 service in Bury. Always important to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice. http://t.co/uASd6viRPL Sun Apr 26 18:17:23 BST 2015
@pinkhair43 Great to meet you too Sarah. Keep fighting for the NHS. Sat Apr 25 22:04:00 BST 2015
@dannylafiesta Surprised supporter of Green Party happy to mislead people about Labour, but not hold Tories to account for a broken promise. Sat Apr 25 20:12:39 BST 2015
@dannylafiesta Tories promised if they won in 2010 there would be Consultant led unit. Instead, they closed unit totally. That's the  truth. Sat Apr 25 19:53:52 BST 2015
@dannylafiesta This story confirms I am telling the truth. Under Labour there was to be a midwife led maternity unit at Fairfield. Sat Apr 25 19:52:01 BST 2015
@dannylafiesta Bury North Tory David Nuttall said at hustings last week that David Cameron had lied to him re keeping Maternity unit open. Sat Apr 25 18:43:40 BST 2015
@dannylafiesta Closed by a Tory Govt after 2010 election. Despite several pre election visits by Cameron  saying he promised to save it. Sat Apr 25 18:41:15 BST 2015

@JaneLBlack  Brilliant work putting this right Jane. Thank you. Tue Apr 21 22:36:32 BST 2015
@TheSiJones As you are following me  you will have seen daily tweets of our positive offer and vision for the future. Tue Apr 21 22:28:45 BST 2015
@TheSiJones Every day we are talking about issues such as jobs, pay, young people+the NHS. All they want to do is frighten people about SNP. Tue Apr 21 22:26:23 BST 2015
@s100py  @JaneLBlack and @PrestwichLabour have done a great job and thanks to you for your campaign. Tue Apr 21 22:21:27 BST 2015
David Cameron promised to rid Tories of nasty party tag. How ironic, he is now running a campaign spreading fear and division. #NastyParty Tue Apr 21 22:14:58 BST 2015

Great Sunday @labourdoorstep session with @CaitlinBisknell +her energetic campaign team http://t.co/EZuSEmbQwS Sun Apr 19 15:53:56 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule Hope u are very much part of future. But you are clearly not in touch with the relationships of trust+ respect we have built. Sat Apr 18 23:36:54 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule I accept you+others feel we should field candidates. That is not our position. But your other criticisms are wide of the mark. Sat Apr 18 23:30:36 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule As a "stakeholder"I don't recall you ever asking for meeting or interview. Why would you? You are a journalist based in Oxford Sat Apr 18 23:21:24 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule To describe engagement as arrogant + aloof suggests u are very out of touch re excellent relationships I'm proud to have built Sat Apr 18 23:17:33 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule if you read what I said I also made it clear that Labours manifesto includes some specific commitments re N Ireland. Sat Apr 18 23:12:42 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule  I'm sure you wouldn't want to quote me out of context. Sat Apr 18 23:11:14 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule I was answering question about why Tories have a specific manifesto. They are fielding candidates in N Ireland, we are not, Sat Apr 18 23:10:42 BST 2015
@Luke_Sproule You may not agree with our decision not to field candidates. But i think u will find stakeholders view us as engaged+in touch. Sat Apr 18 23:06:55 BST 2015
@WellieWearer There is no statutory Yth Service. I agree with your point re prevention/early intervention. This will be big part of review. Sat Apr 18 23:02:52 BST 2015
@Chrisryder47 If we win the election, we will have clear priorities which I will share at the appropriate time. Sat Apr 18 21:01:14 BST 2015
@Chrisryder47 Our manifesto identifies some of our priorities. Proposed changes to Economic pact influenced by work of Heenan Anderson. Sat Apr 18 20:59:14 BST 2015
@Chrisryder47 Tories are contesting seats in N Ireland. We are not, as you know. Heenan Anderson report will be published when ready, Sat Apr 18 20:56:37 BST 2015
Voter registration deadline on Monday. The number of students who will lose the right to vote is a national disgrace https://t.co/LmHx3eytsR Sat Apr 18 20:45:34 BST 2015

@MartynBanniste1  Hi Martyn, have you made contact with my office? Sat Apr 18 14:10:33 BST 2015
@stuartafa_s Not great! Where is this? Sat Apr 18 13:33:15 BST 2015
Beautiful morning +great team out and about in Besses, Whitefield. Lots of support for @UKLabour on #labourdoorstep http://t.co/Vi7BU1vT55 Sat Apr 18 13:32:02 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby Also, Developer submitted later scheme which Cllr colleagues rightly rejected because it was nothing more than a tarting up. Fri Apr 17 22:38:54 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby As Developer  owns most of the precinct area, action depends on their willingness to invest. Fri Apr 17 22:35:57 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby Council has put aside significant money to invest in A56 part of village. Needs to be spent as part of new plan not wasted. Fri Apr 17 22:31:55 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby  Good news is talks have started again between council+developer re new plan. Read my election pledges http://t.co/6ql2J2f4de Fri Apr 17 22:25:53 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby We agreed an exciting vision then the company pulled the scheme because they no longer had  the finance. Fri Apr 17 22:22:52 BST 2015
@ShirleyBrumby This is not the case. Most of the precinct area is owned by a private developer not the council. Fri Apr 17 22:21:03 BST 2015
@eekychimp Read my election pledges which refer to this issue. http://t.co/6ql2J2f4de Fri Apr 17 20:47:18 BST 2015
@eekychimp The Developer withdrew scheme because of lack of finance. Good news is serious talks are back on with council re new scheme. Fri Apr 17 20:46:16 BST 2015
@DaveSkydriver  They will be affected by many of the policies. Also, we are committed to introducing Votes at 16 if we win the election. Fri Apr 17 20:33:25 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 Very disappointing you have no interest in the excellent range of   other policies which respond directly to y peoples concerns. Fri Apr 17 20:17:44 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 I hope you will live with your conscience if we end up with a Tory govt. It is you who runs risk of betraying young people. Fri Apr 17 20:16:03 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 Delete 1st "not." What is needed is a root and branch review inc quality and y peoples voice issues as well as funding. Fri Apr 17 19:53:14 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 No, we have not done rt thing by not making an unfunded promise which would have made you happy but not changed 1 y persons life. Fri Apr 17 19:51:03 BST 2015
@ChrisBarlass Thanks Chris. Would you like any further information.? Fri Apr 17 19:47:46 BST 2015
@prestwich_bunny  re Prestwich village Developer pulled scheme because of lack of funds. Serious talks back on with council re new scheme. Fri Apr 17 19:43:08 BST 2015
@prestwich_bunny  We should discuss. I've asked him to send me details. Fri Apr 17 19:40:23 BST 2015

@WellieWearer Definitely. Anyone who remembers my period as Minister For Y People knows I listen to the frontline. Same with @lisanandy Fri Apr 17 17:56:32 BST 2015
@PeteSims1  I know you are disappointed but the review will be serous and wide ranging. Hopefully you will contribute. Card out of the bin? Fri Apr 17 17:48:24 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 If you think caring about y people is giving a new  duty to councils cut to the bone then you are wrong. They couldn't deliver. Fri Apr 17 17:45:49 BST 2015
@KurdishWAG Send me details and I will try and help. Fri Apr 17 13:29:58 BST 2015
Many thanks to @lisanandy @LabourRoyall @LiamByrneMP+
Labour colleagues for  #ShapeYourFuture engagement. Great manifesto launch today. Fri Apr 17 13:28:47 BST 2015
@brumparticipate Definitely that will be our priority. At time councils have had nrly 50% cuts giving stat responsibility undeliverable. Fri Apr 17 13:12:46 BST 2015

@s100py See my election pledges http://t.co/6ql2J2f4de Happy to discuss further. Fri Apr 17 10:59:46 BST 2015
@s100py  Reason  never happened is developer no longer had funding due to recession. But good news new serious talks underway with council Fri Apr 17 10:57:58 BST 2015
@PeteSims1 It will reflect scale of challenge but we won't make promises that are not deliverable. Fri Apr 17 09:29:05 BST 2015
@brumparticipate Yes, as I said it is in our manifesto. Fri Apr 17 09:08:05 BST 2015
An important step to open up opportunities for all y people + get social mobility moving again in our country. https://t.co/l7AMROt0yc Fri Apr 17 08:51:22 BST 2015

@Ed_Miliband a top leadership performance again tonight. Getting stronger +stronger. Cameron the big loser. Panic in Tory ranks will grow. Thu Apr 16 21:33:56 BST 2015
People may now begin to realise the same arrogance and poor judgment that led David Cameron not to turn up is the way he runs the country. Thu Apr 16 21:06:33 BST 2015
@Chrisryder47 Definitely not. See my reply to Kevin Skelly. Thu Apr 16 20:34:20 BST 2015

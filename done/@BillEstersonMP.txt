@bpas1968 @radhikasanghani @TeleWonderWomen the key is to prevent future damage by making sure women (and men) have all the information
@bpas1968 @radhikasanghani @TeleWonderWomen it's not for me to advise but there is nothing they can do about what has already happened.
@bpas1968 @radhikasanghani @TeleWonderWomen isn't the problem there is no way of knowing which babies will be harmed and which will not?

.@bpas1968 happy to support fortification of flour with folic acid. Does it help counter effects of drinking during pregnancy?
.@bpas1968 Good point about level of unplanned pregnancies but do you agree that the safest option is no drinking during pregnancy?
@bpas1968 I have a debate next Tuesday in Westminster Hall on foetal alcohol syndrome. What would you like me to ask govt to do?
@bpas1968 it's not about stigmatising. it is about informing. Labeling in France was introduced for this reason.
@bpas1968 but a message that says don't worry about binge drinking is very misleading. Any drinking can cause problems.
.@bpas1968 your website quotes the risks of binge drinking during pregnancy. This appears to contradict what you said in the media today.
.@bpas1968 the problem is that even small amounts of alcohol can cause damage especially early in pregnancy. Is there a safe drinking level?
Concerned to hear British Pregnancy Advisory Service on @bbc5live imply women can binge drink during pregnancy without harming their baby.

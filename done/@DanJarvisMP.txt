Passion, principle and policies to change Britain. Here's @EdMiliband's barnstorming speech in full: http://t.co/PP3HjY1MUZ #6monthstowin
.@Ed_Miliband 'Tell them what we stand for. £8 minimum wage, 200,000 homes a year, cutting business rates, ending #BedroomTax' #6monthstowin
.@Ed_Miliband: 'Farage & his gang have got away with it for far too long. We can take this lot apart and it's time we did.' #6monthstowin
.@Ed_Miliband: 'Low pay, insecurity, relying on a few at the top - failed ideas of the past that we will consign to history.' #6monthstowin
'@UKLabour will be the party on your side...fighting #forthemany'
A thought from 'Why Vote Labour' with #6monthstowin http://t.co/YqCr4QBZGe
Just seen @kajakimovie. A brilliant but brutal portrayal of war. Colleagues in @UKParliament must see it #KajakiMovie http://t.co/BQzrX7CCRo

@RS987 went to see it myself. Terrible. Harrow Council need to be put under pressure to rethink. Spoken to Cllr Susan Hall who agrees Sat Apr 11 18:04:52 BST 2015
Neglect of parks by Labour Harrow Council not a marginal issue ; residents hate  it and know it leads to other problems #timeforrethink Sat Apr 11 13:48:23 BST 2015
Harrow Council got rid of parkeeper and bins will  only be emptied once a week. Sat morning and they are all overflowing ; litter everywhere Sat Apr 11 13:38:14 BST 2015

Nor does ONS capture any of the social value and magic created by voluntary action in communities...3 day policy will enable more... Fri Apr 10 08:10:50 BST 2015
.. £ 20 bn ONS economic valuation of volunteering takes no account of informal volunteering or positive impact on wellbeing of volunteers. Fri Apr 10 07:55:23 BST 2015
In case anyone thinks voluntary action is a side issue; 15 million people do it regularly and ONS puts economic value on it of £ 20 bn plus Fri Apr 10 07:46:16 BST 2015
Best employers increasingly recognise that good employee volunteering progs have big HR value as well as CSR. Good for business productivity Fri Apr 10 07:44:17 BST 2015
Surveys show " lack of time" as biggest barrier to volunteering : 3 days paid leave could be a gamechanger in encouraging more social action Fri Apr 10 07:42:10 BST 2015
Conservatives will give employees in large companies right to 3 days paid leave for volunteering..potential to create a lot of social value Fri Apr 10 07:39:36 BST 2015

Dropping Heathrow Spur also simplifies case for the HS2 tunnel extension that we are petitioning for to protect Ickenham and Colne Valley. Tue Mar 10 08:36:50 GMT 2015
If HS2 happens, the best way of connecting passengers to Heathrow is thru Old Oak Common. Spur was wrong idea and caused unfair blight. Tue Mar 10 08:34:13 GMT 2015

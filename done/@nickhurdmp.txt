We have the most successful not for profit sector in world because of its ability to adapt. That resilience being tested like never before

Civil Society has so much to offer a public sector that is now waking up to the need to do things in different ways with different people.
Civil Society has so much to give and receive from a business community that more than ever needs to be seen as good citizens.
Civil society enjoys  impressive support from its greatest asset _ the British people. Giving steady and volunteering up in difficult times

Incredibly proud of #NCS grads from Harrow and Ealing. Very impressive group . Strangers to each other 10 days ago: now a bonded team.
I believe we can do more to help all young people develop the life skills employers are looking for. http://t.co/5nfhxwaIuJ
@graduatejobsUK DM headline v misleading. I am not saying young people lack grit. My twitter feed explains.
@Mojo131313 Hi Mollie, DM headline misleading - quite understand your reaction. Not what I was saying at all. Please see my twitter feed.
This is a debate about how we can help them succeed in an ever more competitive world and realise their potential.
The headline suggests I am criticising teenagers. I would never do that. They are growing up in an ever more complex and challenging world.
These programmes complement the huge amount of work to raise standards in schools and transform apprenticeship and training opportunities.
Which is why we are growing #ncs so fast and supporting the independent campaign for #youthsocialaction.
We know from research that extra curricular activities like #nationalcitizenservice can help develop those valuable skills and confidence,,,
It is employers who are telling us that the so called soft skills matter more and more in the modern workplace......
Daily Mail headline misrepresents an important point. It is employers raising concerns about how work ready many young people are.....
At Wembley Stadium to celebrate Danone Nations Cup .Largest intl football tournament for children comes to UK as partner of #inspiredby2012

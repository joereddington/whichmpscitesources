@BarryGardiner You did indeed. Good Labour question. Poor Tory answer!!!!!
@BarryGardiner says there's been £3 billion rise per year in uncollected taxes and asks what govt is doing about it.
@KarlTurnerMP asks why Chancellor chooses to cut taxes 4 the most well off whilst reducing living standards for the lowest paid. No answer!
@William_Bain points out ifs prediction that child poverty will continue to rise under this govt. No satisfactory answer!
@heidi_mp points out getting reduction of £1.7 billion EU bill needs govt 2 work with others in Europe Govt's behaviour makes that unlikely
@gavinshuker asks if reason Chancellor won't allow OBR 2 audit party's economic plans is because he has loads of unfounded tax plans.
@edballsmp asks 4 govt to give immigration forecast. Chancellor unable to answer question. Shame!!
@edballsmp asks how long govt knew it was getting a £1.7 billion?  Why didn't Chancellor know about ONS revision?  Was he asleep on the job?
@BolsoverBeast Asks how on earth can govt justify tax cuts 4 highest paid whilst cutting wages if nurses & midwives. Answer- they can't!!
@HelenJonesMP underlines how tough it is for people struggling to make ends meet. Minister shows she's out of touch by her complacent answer
@DerekTwiggMP asks 4 how many months wages have risen higher than prices. Minister waffles which means he doesn't know or he knows it's none
@AndyLoveMP draws attention to falling living standards. Chief sec admits wages have not being growing........
@SteveReedMP points out that number of people using tax credits to boost income has risen from less than a quarter to two fifths.
@stephenctimms @stephenctimms asks if govt will manage to halve deficit by general election. Minister uses a lot of words to say NO!!!!
@Alison_McGovern says Chancellor failed own test of clearing deficit & has let people struggling 2 make ends meet down. Poor answer frm govt
@ShabanaMahmood says govt totally failed to tackle tax avoidance, as under collection soars whilst family budgets continue to be squeezed.
@InverclydeMP links under collection of tax to failure of govt to tackle child poverty. Minister struggled to give adequate response!
@heidi_mp draws attention 2 massive under collection if taxes by govt. Calls 4 govt 2 improve its record on tackling tax avoidance & evasion
@spellar asks how govt will tackle scandal of umbrella companies being used to dodge taxes and pay workers less. Complacent answer from govt
@IanMurrayMP asks how govt intends to tackle underemployment and boost productivity. No answer from Chief Secretary!!
@ChrisLeslieMP asks Chancellor to say how his £7billion tax cuts will be paid for. He splutters, not ruling out VAT increase!
Chancellor unable to rule out raising VAT when pressed by @KateGreenSU More squeeze on families and small businesses?
@CatMcKinnellMP points out govt is playing catch up in finally talking about devolving powers 2 north like Labour. Chancellor splutters!

@monkfishmc Thank you!
@Scunthorpe_Dad @looknorthBBC  I was busy calling for hospital car parking charges to be scrapped, working in the House of Commons today?
Spoke in the debate on hospital car parking charges to emphasise the need for them to be reduced or better still scrapped.
It does look as though Chief Whip Gove is doing the Times crossword whilst PM answers questions on world events. Surely not .....
Asked Minister 2 give assurances that #ILF recipients will not lose their independence due to transfer 2 local authorities. Still no answer!

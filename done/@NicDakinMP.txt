@cuddlemonkey19 That doesn't sounds good. If you also email me about that and I'll raise with the police and the council. Mon Mar 16 19:38:11 GMT 2015
@JP_Simpson I've lived my whole adult life in Scunthorpe, which I am proud of. I've brought up 3 children here.  So unsurprisingly I agree! Mon Mar 16 19:37:15 GMT 2015

@benwainman I support more proper devolution. English Votes 4 English laws -  not a practical solution, not simple as it seems & risks union Mon Mar 16 19:25:31 GMT 2015

@ScunthorpeIndy I vote in line with my conscience as I have to account to my constituents.  No-one should hide behind the whip. Mon Mar 16 19:07:44 GMT 2015

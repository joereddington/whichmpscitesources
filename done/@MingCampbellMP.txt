I've just been to see some of the campaigners who fought so hard for @rafleuchars to say thank you.
The MoD decision not to retain RAF Leuchars is fundamentally wrong, strategically inept and likely to increase the risk to our citizens.
The news today that Forth Coastguard is proposed for closure is profoundly disappointing. I will meet with the Transport Sec to discuss.
There is still time to let the PM know that RAF Leuchars should be retained. You could email him on your lunch break. http://t.co/3eeG5D2
RAF Leuchars decision is imminent. But the race isn't over until we reach the tape. Email the PM with your views http://t.co/3eeG5D2
I'm pleased that the PM understands the case for @RAFLeuchars & acknowledges remarkable level of support. @thecourieruk http://t.co/p96PazB
The government must now put its mouth where its money is and back RAF Leuchars. The Â£3m recent investment is significant http://t.co/q3qe3iZ
There is some excellent coverage of the overwhelming defence case for the retention of RAF Leuchars today.
There is still all to play for in the campaign to save RAF Leuchars from potential closure. http://bit.ly/mFal8C
If reports about a review of Coastguard proposals are true then it's a victory for common sense. They do not have a single friend in HoC.
The campaign for the Olympic torch to come to North East Fife has been more than a year in the making.
I am delighted to announce that St Andrews will be one of the locations for the Olympic torch relay.
Important elections today. Hard working @iainsmith4msp deserves your vote in NE Fife, @scotlibdems on the list and #Yes2AV.

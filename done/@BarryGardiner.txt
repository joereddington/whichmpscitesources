@BitsofBooks 
Technically it was a programme motion about the timing and subject matter of the substantive debate now happening...
@BitsofBooks 
Actually it was about the credibility of PM who promised a vote on EU Arrest Warrant before by election & has now bottled it
Giving a whole new meaning to the words "Pyrrhic Victory".
Vote 251 for government 242 against.
Gove has alienated his right wing destroyed the Home Sec's credibility and turned David Cameron into a liar all in just one afternoon
Bravo!
"Shambles!"
The one word on every MPs lips as they went through the lobby just now.
The Speaker is just politely and elegantly destroying the Home Secretary.
She says the vote is indicative. The Speaker has ruled it is not.
Chief Whip Michael Gove has created a worse balls up today on the European Arrest Warrant vote than he managed even at Dept of Education
Rees-Mogg accuses the government of being "underhand"
Sir Richard Shepherd accuses his own party of bringing the chamber into disrepute
Rees-Mogg says they are embarking on "The Road to Tyranny"
Michael Gove has finally come from his ivory tower in the chief whips office to the floor of the House to rescue his colleagues - not!
Chris Grayling, in a display of amazing discourtesy addressed the Commons for less than 2 minutes to justify not allowing the promised vote
Bill Cash MP chair of European Scrutiny Select Committee accuses his own Home Secretary of perpetrating "a trick" on the House of Commons
Speaker says this has been a "Sorry saga" with government trying to "slip things through" in a way that is "contemptuous" of parliament
The chancellor was strangely reluctant to confirm that the EU Budget will show UK paid £1.7bn surcharge in full.

Great to have the British Heart Foundation supporting our Air Quality Campaign this morning.
Mayor of London's proposals are coyly/confusingly for "Zero Emissions capable taxis" from 1st January 2018. 
Why not simply zero emissions
Mayor of London admits to EAC "Clearly much more needs to be done before compliance with NO2 limit values will be achieved in London"
Interesting to find that Mayor of London's self-justifying submission to EACSelect Committee is based on modelling not real world data.
Boris 2009 Electric vehicle delivery plan for 25,000 charge points has delivered just1,400 of which only 130 are fast charge.

Chants at the Swarm on Downing St:
1.What do we want?: Bees
When do we want them: Forever
2.Give Bees a Chance
3.I'm a Beeliever
Our youngest beeliever in the ban on neonicitinoids http://t.co/OeH8l6odHG
Some younger Bees joining us outside Downing Street to stop derogation from ban on neonicitinoid insecticides http://t.co/canJCexr1K
Outside Downing Street to uphold the ban on neonicitinoid insecticides that are killing our bees & other pollinators http://t.co/9JHI4s5LbN
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has failed to act as a competent authority on the regulation of insecticides
Insufficient evidence Syngenta’s proposals comply with UK & European legal safeguards & what they say they have has not been made public.
Use of neonicotinoid during the 2 year ban would prevent scientists gathering evidence on the impact of the ban on health of pollinators
Off to swarm on Downing Street
to oppose Syngenta’s request for an emergency derogation from the European neonicitinoid ban.
We're swarming on Downing Street tomorrow to tell David Cameron to protect our bees, come along & RT to spread word http://t.co/xtmaQ7fOlz

Chair of Environment Agency Lord Smith says this gov has NOT been the greenest government ever.

Oh yes...& Eric Pickles is "unforgivable"!!
Dr Ian Mudway tells EAC that we continue to build affordable housing and schools next to most polluted roads.
Where is the joined-up Gov?
31% of the food we consume that we could grow ourselves is actually imported.
Dairy production growing at more than 2% a year.
Dairy UK chairman Billy Keane tells the room that Dairy industry is a reinvigorated outward looking industry with a growth & expansion plan.
Dr Ian Mudway tells EAC 35,000 people in Tower Hamlets and Hackney living in air pollution hot spots.
Phil Insall of Sustrans tells Environment Audit Committee that the responsibility for air pollution sits with the PM & the Chancellor.
DEFRA Perm Sec taking a pasting from PAC on why they signed a funding agreement to reimburse exchange rate risks despite no legal obligation
Alan Andrews from Client Earth points out to Select Committee the danger of DEFRA checking their own homework on air pollution.
@danielbyles 
I'm sitting right behind her!
Heard it with my own ears.
Alan Andrew from Client Earth tells Select Committee that DEFRA seems at pains to keep air pollution problems under wraps.
Gov has told Environment Audit Committee their public awareness campaign has been a success. 

None of the witnesses agree!
Dr Ian Mudway tells EAC "air pollution not just about mortality it's about general wellness particularly for our children"
Astonishing to find, in an aside at Public Accounts Committee, DEFRA Perm Sec reveals she is unaware of UK importing biomass from USA
DEFRA Perm Sec is valiantly trying to defend large waste incinerator policy before PAC.
Not convincing chair @margarethodge

When Alistair Darling gets up and speaks in the Commons, all sides of the House of Commons shut up and listen. He'll be greatly missed.
Let no one forget: our response to the global financial crash - led by Alistair and Gordon - stopped many repossessions and saved many jobs.
Very sad to hear Alistair Darling is standing down at the next election. He has made an immense contribution to our country and our party.

Save for BIS Minister Jo Swinson not one LibDem backbencher gave a speech in our debate on the national minimum wage this afternoon.
Transcript of our minimum wage debate: http://t.co/xyhNKzaXA4. As I said in the Chamber, Lord Freud's comments were absolutely disgraceful.
Myself & @IainWrightMP are working closely with @NicDakinMP @TomBlenkinsop @tomgreatrexmp & others on the Tata issue.
With the industry in mind - a key sector - its crucial Tata works with trade unions and others to navigate a way through.
The UK steel industry supports thousands of skilled jobs and is an essential part of a modern economy with manufacturing at its heart.
The announcement by Tata Steel of the sale of its Long Products division creates uncertainty and will worry thousands of its employees...

Hardie wld have rejected NHS privatisation,cutting taxes for millionaires whilst hiking them up for others, and taking away rights at work

Vince Cable can’t run away from his record as part of the Tory-led Govt or try to pretend Tory policies have nothing to do with the Lib Dems
Vince Cable and the LibDems promised to be on the side of working people, but pple are £1.6K p.a. worse off since they joined Tories in govt
Vince Cable & the Lib Dems said they wanted fairer taxes but gave people earning millions a tax break while everyone else pays more #ldconf
Vince Cable and the Liberal Democrats promised to scrap university tuition fees and then trebled them #ldconf
Vince says he's pro worker but has trampled on people’s rights at work & erected exorbitant tribunals fees for those who have been wronged
Back Labour’s plans for an £8 minimum wage in the next Parliament by signing our petition here: http://t.co/2RzRZ55iUn
Vince hasn't mentioned trebling tuition fees, his disastrous privatisation of Royal Mail or erecting tribunal fees. Funny that #ldconf

John Redwood’s comments reveal a Tory party focused on pushing Britain towards the EU exit door, not batting for UK business and jobs.
85% of manufacturers would vote to stay in the EU.  In contrast, only 7% would vote to pull out of the EU - http://t.co/1qTBRFY69b
Its outrageous that in a democracy where we enjoy free speech Tory Eurosceptics should seek to muzzle those who believe in our EU membership
3/3 Our membership of the EU is a political AND economic issue so our businesses - large and small - should play a full part in the debate
2/3 If true, these are vile and disgraceful comments from an experienced parliamentarian who should know better - http://t.co/0ZZax0aHwq

For all the noise on D.Carswell's defection, UKIP doesn't provide the answers to our challenges. I explain why here: http://t.co/61Vr3JMQh7
Ah...I stand corrected first (very briefly) UKIP MP was Bob Spink!
So Douglas Carswell beats Farage to become UKIP's first MP - no doubt seeking to keep the flame of Thatcherism alive like his new leader.
We also want to see far more competition in a banking sector where lending to almost 5 million businesses is dominated by 4 high st banks
We'll set up a British Investment Bank with regional banks (like the Sparkassen in Germ) to ensure our small biz get the finance they need
3/3 Despite scheme after scheme & promise after promise from Ministers, profitable businesses still can't access the finance they need
2/3 and yet today’s Funding for Lending data shows net lending to small biz falling by £435m and to all businesses dropping by £3.9bn...
1/3 The Bank of England’s credit conditions survey for Q2 reported that demand for credit across all company sizes increased significantly..

The FCA raised concerns with RBS on mortgage sales in 2011- it's disgraceful this was not immediately acted on.
Swap misselling by banks to small businesses happened 8yrs ago - this mortgage misselling by RBS was happening less than 18months ago!
Taking out a mortgage is the biggest purchase a consumer makes and, as such, the FCA findings into RBS are both shocking and disappointing.

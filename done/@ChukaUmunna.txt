Lets have a proper, calm, debate about gentrification, what it is, what it means and what to do about it - violence is totally unacceptable Sun Apr 26 16:00:46 BST 2015

How can Cameron & the Tory Party contemplate doing a deal with Nigel Farage? Wld be the final nail in the coffin of One Nation Conservatism Fri Apr 03 15:59:27 BST 2015
Nigel Farage purports to speak for Britain. Well he doesn't - his comments are totally at odds with everything we stand for. Fri Apr 03 15:56:25 BST 2015
Unsurprisingly it seems Nigel Farage's disgusting HIV comments last night were planned all along. Fri Apr 03 15:54:32 BST 2015

Nigel Farage talks as if abolishing the foreign aid budget will sort out our public finances - utter rubbish #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:34:13 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband: we'll balance the books but do it in a better and fairer way than this govt #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:15:20 BST 2015

"Believe in a better Britain – not Nigel Farage" | great piece by @DanJarvisMP - http://t.co/ZIF4X4R2q5 Thu Mar 12 19:11:23 GMT 2015
UKIP's Nigel Farage tells @BBCr4today "we are going down the road of enforced quotas." Total nonsense. Thu Mar 12 08:31:57 GMT 2015
There is a virus of racism running through UKIP. You can't root it out if you're incapable of recognising it exists in our country. Thu Mar 12 08:04:28 GMT 2015
To take just one example - after seeing the footage of Chelsea fans recently, how can the UKIP leader deny the need for race equality laws? Thu Mar 12 07:43:31 GMT 2015
The UKIP leader claims his party is "colour blind" when we've seen a stream of racist comments from UKIP councillors,candidates and members. Thu Mar 12 07:40:46 GMT 2015
Utterly disgraceful and totally ignorant comments from the UKIP leader on our race equality laws.We must all speak out against this nonsense Thu Mar 12 07:37:31 GMT 2015

The sooner TfL take over the running of all suburban rail lines in London the better. Far more confidence in them than Southern etc Tue Mar 10 08:23:16 GMT 2015
I dread the prospect of Southern's owners taking over the Thameslink rail services from my constituency in July. Tue Mar 10 08:22:09 GMT 2015
So Southern's train is running almost 10mins late and just before it arrives we're told it's not the usual 10 cars but 6. It arrives full Tue Mar 10 08:18:45 GMT 2015

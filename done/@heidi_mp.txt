@heidi_mp
.@Se_Railway any news on re-opening platform 4 gate at Lewisham? The latest @NewLewisham works make it even more urgent. Fingers crossed ...
@josscrowley don't worry - am on my way into Parliament now (on a very crowded Southeastern train)
“@saffydaffyduck: @heidi_mp I know I don't even need to ask, but you are backing @CliveEfford's Bill today aren't you? #saveournhs”>YES :-)
@alex_france @lewishamcouncil @newlewisham it's chaos again this morning though ...
@alex_france sorry to hear that - I had strangely free flowing train/bus journeys through Lewisham yesterday. Almost had to pinch myself.
Had the honour of cutting the cake at 75th anniversary of Lewisham @CitizensAdvice - pic courtesy of @JamesJWalsh http://t.co/W0HbLQFfqK
Last year @CitizensAdvice in #Lewisham helped 6500 people. Privileged to be at their 75th anniversary tonight. Great cause, values & vision.
.@WhizzL1z I will be voting for the Bill being championed by @CliveEfford tomorrow, so you don't need to do anything! #backthebill
@MsLupin @bbcmarkeaston @communitiesuk @phoenixtogether it's preserved RTB (when stock is transferred from a council to housing assoc)
@MsLupin would have to check about that - my understanding is that the finances just don't stack up in terms of the cost of replacement.
@MsLupin @bbcmarkeaston @communitiesuk ps - the increase is also causing real problems for housing associations such as @phoenixtogether.
@MsLupin @bbcmarkeaston @communitiesuk they've massively upped discounts - talk of 1:1 replacement of homes sold under RTB is also nonsense.
@clogsilk indeed.
In 2012/13 it took 05:23 for firefighters to get to incidents in Downham. After Boris closed our fire station, it's up to 07:15. Not good.
Pleased to host @RealLondonLives research findings event today: real people & real stories from @G15London tenants. http://t.co/3LY4IA4aCU
@gabbywain @lucy_grove @caffy45 @homesforbritain @reallondonlives thanks for you time - sorry for the slightly crazy/delayed start!

@BarryQuirk1 enjoy!
@Dayna_Edwin @gmbyounglondon afraid I can't make the demo but do intend to be in parliament on 28/11 to vote for the bill.
@BarryQuirk1 have you seen this? It's fascinating (in that slightly geeky, geography sort of way) http://t.co/BdHcHga0rG
Astonishingly poor replies from Ministers in Home Office Questions today - promising response to my Q about online child grooming though.
@LByrne81 @envirolewisham ps - Rachel is the councillor in Lewisham with responsibility for the environment, hence including her in thread.
@LByrne81 @envirolewisham not sure they are but problem does seem to be growing. Copying to @RachelOnikosi as she may have further thoughts.
@LByrne81 @envirolewisham where is this? Do you use @lovecleanstreet app to report?
@LByrne81 I know. It's a real problem. Have been doing some work on this on the south of the borough. Hoping @envirolewisham can help.

@MariaConyard @mountsfieldpark @conservationng @bdp_com it was really lovely - well done (& thank you for the great pizza too).
@Notable_Yokel @withjamandbread I think there will be lots of smaller units in the scheme too.
@TKViews he feels worse off & definitely isn't a fan of the PM. He also didn't like Government attempt to close Lewisham Hospital.
@Notable_Yokel yes - agree in principle but without it am not sure the scheme would be commercially viable - some difficult choices ahead.

Campaigning with the excellent @RuthCadbury in Chiswick. Great to have @HackneyAbbott with us too. http://t.co/J1VSQR4fI8
MT “@wdcfplus: Whitefoot social hosted by @Rozhardie with @heidi_mp @CllrMarkIngleby @jgslater http://t.co/9z0NJ59Dja”>Lovely 2 see you all!
@LynnCSchreiber good grief - now that really would be a promotion!!
So, know I'm late to ice bucket challenge but now done (jointly with @mralph_bally) - boy next door much amused http://t.co/5sFyzTQ3OX
@JamesJWalsh brilliant - thank you - all sorted. You are definitely my no.1 technology advisor.
@JamesJWalsh can you apply that to just one video or does Martin have to change it for all his posts (he's not keen on the latter!)
@JamesJWalsh @macmillancancer OK, I've now done it - video is on Martin's Facebook - need to work out how to extract link for twitter!
@CatfordSociety @help_its_louis @edb_architect the plot thickens! I've just heard Camden Bars may be involved again but need to check this.
@help_its_louis @catfordsociety am very interested in this too - hoping @tesco can shed some light on it all ...
@60isnew18 @lewishamlabour is there a particular application you're worried about or is it a more general concern?
@vickyannand just got back from holiday so haven't witnessed problems for myself yet. Have you raised with @NewLewisham?
@sherlylocked possibly - depends upon the question/issue - do you want to email me & will see if I can help?
Lively Q&A about @OnBlackheath tonight. Good to see @kevinbonavia. Failed to put a face to @BlackheathRev though - come say hello next time!
@Mattbriggs3 great - see you tomorrow .
@Mattbriggs3 yes - can you make it?
.@MPSLewisham just stumbled across this in Barcelona and thought of you :-) http://t.co/hZqkxeXUY2
Report from my "Don't Dump in Downham" Cleaner Streets Summit is now on my website: http://t.co/QYiwUq6QEf @phoenixtogether @EnviroLewisham
@NewCollSwindon 21 years ago since I got mine but remember it like it was yesterday.
@CamillaYahaya keeping everything crossed for you!
@michaelmaq from your RTs, it looks like you did pretty well (understatement probably!) in your A-Levels - well done - much deserved.
MT “@JamesJWalsh: #NewBusiness have to arrange for @heidi_mp & I to take a tour @kaspasdesserts #catford http://t.co/OhCeOZtzlT”> you're on!
@ToadsRevisited you're so right. It's totally wrong that some people think it's OK to resolve differences with knives. Tragic for family.
@Broadbentius yes, think we have a way forward which is good. Thanks for your email today - keen to be involved. My office will be in touch.
Busy day in the constituency office, working through small correspondence backlog. Plus an interview with @JumpMag about life in Parliament.
@gemmamorton yes - we have a backlog at the moment. You ask a fair question - I will write to Minister for you.
@Miss_Bertrand @nasichemckenzie @lewishamlabour yes, that relates to overall results - @PaulJMas will be best person to talk detail on this.
@Miss_Bertrand the other person who will be working on this & other issues is @PaulJMas - Lewisham Cabinet Member Children & Young People
@Miss_Bertrand I agree - I know @lewishamlabour committed to increasing second secondary school results by 10% in their recent manifesto.
@4drun have some sympathy with what you're saying but not sure what process @lewishamcouncil used to determine designs etc?
@4drun @lewishamcouncil @mpslewisham where are you concerned about? By The Ram (i.e. just down from Iceland)?
Thank you to the fantastic #labourdoorstep team in Lewisham & Blackheath tonight @kevinbonavia @packwood1 & more :-) http://t.co/e1VaVuIAeO
@CatfordWI @jamesjwalsh vintage tea party sounds fab - if it weren't for Labour Party Conference, I would be there too!
@Lawrenlea have you lodged complaint with @MPSLewisham? If you live in SE23, I'm not your MP - see http://t.co/HHJYDYfW2P to find out who is
So, Boris to stand to be an MP? The Mayor should use the office he holds to take London forward not to further his own personal ambitions.
@tatteredstones can you email me details as I would like to follow this up.
@clogsilk @kevinbonavia @mattbriggs3 @kitchenbuddy will try to find out
And yes, I am holding a tarantula - she's called Cadburys (also from @hawkingcentre) http://t.co/Q7SNjmAB91
Just met Alfie (the owl) from the @hawkingcentre - thank you @phoenixtogether for making my day. http://t.co/Zv1Xaqjy8D

@BillEllson @groveparkse12 @cllrcurran @jimiadefiranye Cllr Adefiranye is definitely looking good!
@DavidWCummins sorry David, I'm not entirely clear what you mean? As I say, if it doesn't get sorted, email me.
@DavidWCummins if @envirolewisham can't sort this, email me & I will raise with the planning dept.
@Mattbriggs3 I see @kevinbonavia has been in touch on this. Email me if specific issues in your area & will look into it.

@ravenobrien1 @phoenixtogether OK - will look out for it.
@NewLewisham thanks for sorting this - I noticed it had gone last week.
@TKViews yes, I'll get the tracing paper out next time! Hope all well with you.
@ravenobrien1 happy to chase up with @phoenixtogether - can you email details to me? I can't recall seeing anything but could be wrong.

@MPSLewisham that's helpful - would be grateful if Insp Brighouse could keep me updated.
@Sparkes @andrembourne @downhamhlc @mpslewisham will raise with them & @LewishamCouncil. If you email me, will let you know how I get on.
Very much enjoying @England_Netball vs South Africa. So makes me want to play again @ejhoyle83.

This parliamentary answer is a disgrace. Misleading use of percentages about approved free schools without sites. http://t.co/cFP1mQgP1I
@waterlilynilly many people are, not all reported. You may wish to read the Shadow Foreign Secretary's comments today http://t.co/xmraBmB1qU
@triston thanks. I do aim to respond to all emails (not always as quickly as I might like but think it's important everyone gets a reply).
Great visit to the Reap Centre in Downham ran by the impressive @fificalder - saturday school, mentoring & much more http://t.co/thUHGz6JLE
@ionasinclair really sorry, I couldn't. I already had other commitments in my diary before the debate was announced.

Horrific scenes from both the Middle East and Ukraine today. Puts this week's Westminster bubble obsessions into perspective.

@blackheathbugle having weighed up arguments on both sides, I did what I thought was right - more info on my website http://t.co/BtGD3ZWFFr.
The Lib Dem hypocrisy on the #bedroomtax is breathtaking. Say one thing, do another. Exactly the same with tuition fees.
@PaulLomax I listened to virtually all of the debate & read widely about the subject over the weekend. If you want a fuller reply, email me.
@richies_tweets I don't know the latest. @CllrAl or @damienegan may be able to update you better than me.
@snigskitchen I voted for it. If you're a constituent & you email me, will respond in more detail. 140 characters aren't enough.
@OnlyBeingLuke not that I know of. @simon_hooks or @Pat_Raven might know more than me?
@TimGluckman good to meet you & nice to see Judith again too.
@RachelOnikosi thanks for RT re #dontdumpindownham event on 26 July - you're more than welcome to come - would be great to have you there.

@help_its_louis I don't think it does. If you're constituent & want full response, email me & will reply after debate.
@BloodRedSpoon I actually think this bill is probably necessary but will be considering detail further & will listen carefully to debate.
@help_its_louis will be looking at this carefully over next few days. Sometimes emergency legislation is necessary but will consider detail.
@JennyChapman great pic - but your leg seems to be going the wrong way?!
@CatfordCat thanks - I read the blog but have yet to see any Bill. Will consider arguments on both sides carefully.
@MsLupin I have seen his post but have yet to see a Bill & would want to see detail of it before making any judgements.
@NewLewisham thanks - it annoys me every time I walk past it!
@OnnMel @billestersonmp @coyleneil @bphillipsonmp @grahamjones_mp @alanolive1 yes!
@billestersonmp @bphillipsonmp @coyleneil @grahamjones_mp thank you all for coming - a great team :-)
@VansVoice sorry, as an opposition whip I don't sign EDMs but if you email me, would be happy to raise issue with minister.

Great questions from @BaringSchool in Parliament today - all hands went up when I asked if they'd heard of @SaveLewishamAE campaign!
@bbqbobs oops, apologies for errant words in last tweet - it's been a very long day!
@bbqbobs the key thing is making the sure the infrastructure is enhanced concurrently - public transport, schools, doctors etc.
@BuildingLivesCI looking forward to it - it will be great for @phoenixtogether.

Good to be at the @BlackheathSoc AGM tonight with @kevinbonavia, talking all things #Blackheath.
@clogsilk you are completely right.

@Mattbriggs3 @se_railway @kevinbonavia well said Sir - saw you from the bus on your way there on Weds morning :-)
@Richardmblack think the responsibility lies with police but in practice, I think there's relatively little. Email me & I'll raise with LBL.
@codechris is this an early day motion? Afraid as an opposition whip, I don't sign EDMs. If you email, will raise issues with minister.
@MsMultilingual @speak2future I don't know but am happy to investigate - could you email me via my website & I'll look into it for you.
@dwilliamsHSJ @baringhallhotel hmm, yes, you're right! You'll be reassured to know everyone was fully clothed ...
@tomcopley will you be doing a report on it? Would be interested to see if you are doing something.
For all you Grove Parkers, can thoroughly recommend @BaringHallHotel. Ate there last night thanks to an early getaway from Parliament :-)
Heartbreaking 2 meet constituent today who only received husband's personal independence payment after he'd died. So wrong #WaitingtoBenefit

@CallingEngland if Scotland votes for independence, our permanent seat could be threatened. Nothing definite but potentially significant.
An enjoyable hour at @LBC with @iancollinsuk & @gordonsouthern. Remember you heard it here first: 2-1 to England (ever the optimist!).
@PublicPolicyS that's what I'm worried about!! I'm just glad it can't go to penalties tonight.
Just leaving a gloriously sunny Lewisham to make my way up to @LBC - will be mulling over the week ahead with @iancollinsuk at 9pm.

@mel_haslam I think you may have had a slightly more fun-filled day than me :-)
@sowadally good to meet you today - funny that it was in Newark & not Lewisham!
Good to join @MichaelPayneUK @meaglemp & the inimitable Steve Pound MP on the #labourdoorstep in Newark today. An enjoyable few hours.
@richies_tweets same been said to me before but modern tunnelling methods could surely overcome? Will ask Boris if he agrees to see me ...
@LewishamScouts actually yes, you're right - it is in my diary, just hadn't clocked it! See you at 6pm on Friday.
@Group51UK appalling. Will speak to colleagues when Parliament resumes later this week.
@LewishamScouts have we got something in the diary? Not sure I've seen details yet but happy to help if I can :-)
@ajpowderly sorry, only just seen this - did you repot to @LewishamCouncil or @TfLTrafficNews? Think they may be best placed to assist.
Boris needs to think beyond the Old Kent Rd if he's serious about extending the Bakerloo Line http://t.co/DIpIyx1hyN http://t.co/Aos6qREjXc
@coatesrd it's not clear what, if any, routes are really being properly considered. Have written to Boris to try to find out more.
Excellent contribution by Junior Smart from @StGilesTrustSOS at the London Gangs Summit - talked a lot of sense.
@KateSLP will call at about 1.30 - that OK?
@KateSLP yes - can give you a call in the afternoon?
.@ejhoyle83 FINALLY! I'm going to write to him to push him on how he plans to take it forward in detail #extendthebakerloo :-)
@OnlyBeingLuke I don't know but @CllrAl might be able to help?
@lara_norris well said you. From twitter, it looks like you might have some firefighters helping you too :-)
@GroveParkSE12 @baringhallhotel afraid I can't make either the drop-in or the big lunch on Sunday (am away for a few days break).
@LilianGreenwood very pretty - am enjoying your #railrover tweets :-)
@abenaopp just caught up with Bexley local election results - well done you :-)
@OluBabatola @tpearce003 congratulations!
@CharleneWhite @catfordcclub food is great. It's Catford's very own drinking den.
@leepster I was thinking of that yesterday but decided against it. Went to the tip instead - rocknroll lifestyle me!
Lunch @CatfordCClub with @mralph_bally - currently have it to ourselves (suspect that will change soon ...) http://t.co/00dfFLblJ6
Brilliant news: London now has 4 Labour MEPs - huge congratulations @ClaudeMoraesMEP @maryhoneyball @Lucy4MEP @SebDance. Great team.
@JanetDaby thanks Janet - so pleased that Whitefoot now has 3 Labour Councillors. Reflects your hard work over last 4 years & a great team.
@kevinbonavia @packwood1 @j_m_milne it's been a pleasure - really great to see the 3 of you elected last night. A much-deserved win.
@JamesJWalsh and @simon_hooks!
@DavidMical congratulations again David. You & @J_M_Milne need to change your twitter bios!
@SadiqKhan @londonlabour @alanolive1 @telavelle @alicraft @amyfode @finallybennett @jryan298 @janeedbrooke very well said Sadiq! THANK YOU.
Lovely start to day. Coffee from You Don't Bring me Flowers #HitherGreen http://t.co/RRJKWasyyN
@thomtownsend I think that's probably a fair point. The neighbourhood assemblies seem to work well but always room for improvement.
@thomtownsend There were some v bright & capable people elected last night & challenge to executive can be provided in different ways (2/2)
@thomtownsend the way in which the scrutiny function is performed by non-executive councillors will be important (1/2)
@drdickdixon thank you - that's very kind of you to say.
In 2010 Labour won 10 of 21 council seats in Lewisham East (Lib Dems 9, Tories 2). Last night Labour took them all: 21/21. Real achievement.
And last but by no means least, well done @John_Muldoon @JamesJWalsh & Helen Klier - the Labour team in Rushey Green.
Congratulations @JanetDaby @jgslater @CllrMarkIngleby - the Labour team in Whitefoot - excellent result.
Incredible night at Lewisham count. Lewisham East now entirely red. 7 Labour gains from Lib Dems & 1 from the Tories. Great team effort.
Blackheath now has 3 Labour Councillors @kevinbonavia @AmandadeRyk @GarethSiddorn - one more gain from Lib Dems.
Catford South Labour team re-elected - @CllrAl @evastamirowski @ElAbdeslam. Excellent.
Labour gains 2 seats in Lee Green from Lib Dems: Jim Mallory @simon_hooks & @Pat_Raven will all be great councillors. So pleased for them.
The new Downham Labour Councillors @AndreMBourne, David Britton & Timi Ogunbadewa http://t.co/2LCNGPaDzX
And 3 Labour councillors in Grove Park - more gains in #Lewisham, this time from the Tories.
3 new labour councillors in Downham - all gains from the Lib Dems - #labourwinninghere
@TimRKennett indeed. Off to the Lewisham count now & hoping for some more (job satisfaction that is, not cheesecake!)
@CherryParker well done to you & Paul - much deserved!
@simonstorvik oh no, the pressure is now on! Welcome to Lewisham East & hope we get the chance to meet soon :-)
Lovely advice surgery surprise: flowers & chocolate cheesecake from a happy constituent. http://t.co/TBjNX3QjQc
Advice surgery in Catford 4-7pm. Then up to Blackheath for the Lewisham count.
@YEUK2012 yes - I will look out for it.
Pleased to help my constituent Steph McCrudden & @FixersUK to spread awareness about BPD - http://t.co/s4hLPlh9Vs http://t.co/mkylEuYyJD
@jeanmarron Lewisham is going to be a while yet - we may not get all ward results until tomorrow.
“@BBCPolitics: #VOTE2014 COUNCIL RESULT: Lab gain Redbridge from NOC http://t.co/ri6CfuCFq2”> Well done @wesstreeting @MikeGapes & team :-)
.@CllrTony so pleased for you - well done everyone @CroydonLabour!
@OnlyBeingLuke mayoral result due tonight and some wards. I think some other wards may be done tomorrow.
@OnlyBeingLuke no, Lewisham mayoral count starts this afternoon, ward counts after that.
Woke up to brilliant news that Labour has won control in Hammersmith & Fulham and Merton. Excellent, just excellent.
Great team effort from @lewishamlabour today. Curious incident with a dog in Downham but @MrTomWilletts was on hand! http://t.co/NgqZJisHPL
Today is election day across London.  Make sure your voice is heard by voting before 10pm. #LondonVotes #VoteLabour http://t.co/NpdDNbpKrH
Calling voters in Lewisham: let's tell this man & his brand of nasty, divisive politics that we're not interested http://t.co/1zl3p2gtFv
3 hrs of early morning #VoteLabour leaflets done with my long suffering husband @mralph_bally. Tea is VERY welcome. http://t.co/2x5PhppTMz
“@thefactoryse6: On the trail Heidi Alexander. http://t.co/XbfOlZdz39”. Love this! #VoteLabour
As my mum would say: leaflets went like hot cakes at Lee station today. Rewarding myself with perfect coffee from @ThekitchenSE12.
@JoJofurnival oh dear - individual wards do leaflets separately - we proof read very carefully but sometimes things slip through the net.
Lots of people taking @lewishamlabour leaflets at Lee Station. Hither Green & Grove Park covered too today. http://t.co/WNggwEVcYo
@lewishamcouncil could look into this? Plse see twitter thread.
Quick breakfast stop @Age_Exchange. Listening to "hang out washing on the siegfried line". Reminds me of Sundays at my nan's as a kid.
@MsLupin I don't know a huge amount about it to be honest. Will have a look & will come back to you.
@DePerzik have you reported to @LewishamCouncil? If not, let me know & I will tell them.
Good morning leafleting session at Blackheath station with @kevinbonavia & @GarethSiddorn http://t.co/AIgOaDTtjO
@labourpress heard this live this morning & nearly choked on my cornflakes.
My husband deserves a medal: sorted Grove Park leaflet delivery session for me so I was free to go on @JPonpolitics on Radio 5. #saintly
@bitoclass @kevinbonavia yes, I did an email to Blackheath constituents & some Lee Green residents too :-)
Great #labourdoorstep with @BOSLabour @coyleneil @JohannaBaxter - campaigning #ForTheMany, not the few #VoteLabour http://t.co/o08wwZB87c
@NickLinford @lewishamcouncil you're right - that's not good. Am sure they will look into it following your tweet but email me if not.
Good but busy day. Meetings with @MPSLewisham & @phoenixtogether. Couple of hours in the office & some #labourdoorstep in Downham to finish.
@coyleneil @harrietharman @valshawcross @spellar @boslabour @southwarklabour looking forward to it! The sun has even come out for us :-)
@avanisoulqueen the inappropriate use of sanctions is a real problem. Government must do a full review of how they are being mis-used.
Pleased to be able to attend a packed @CulverleyGreen residents association AGM tonight. Standing room only! http://t.co/aykna80Fis
@OvertonGraphics @jamesjwalsh yes!
Today's first task: election leaflet delivery session in SE12 (in sunshine!). Genuinely looking forward to it :-) http://t.co/pE8p0y7fNc
@mrsrasker I think I am still waiting for my office to set it up - have chased them today (it's been a busy few months!)
@themedicaldon @savelewishamae labour MPs voted to try to limit the damage of the clause (as amended by the Lords) but Government beat us.
My Commons speech yesterday on Clause 119 of the Care Bill re fast-track hospital closures & downgrades: http://t.co/l2PT9JXxeu
Good to meet @FSBLondon members in Bexley today: access to finance, business rates & HMRC discussed over breakfast! http://t.co/bFH76Zt6Be
@Demotivatrix will post later once it's up on my website
@goonerjanet we did. Government in effect voted 2 restrict access 2 services when TSAs suggest downgrades to hospitals not in failing trust
@mrsrasker he suggested he was funding Lewisham adequately which is not the case
@saffydaffyduck he avoided answering the question (as he did with lots of my colleagues' questions too!)
@PupilAmbassador sounds good - I may be a bit late but should be able to make at least some if it :-)
@danrees @sarahchampionmp it's a big issue. Am off to see Minister with @mayorbullock again soon as ££ from central Government inadequate.
Waiting to vote on criminal justice & courts bill. Been a long day: questioning Mr Gove on free schools, speech on care bill & much more ...
@londoninsider @kevinbonavia sorry to hear you feel that way - what would you have liked to see more on?
@PupilAmbassador when is it? Can you drop me an email with the details - will come if I can.
@elliecole_0 Afraid I don't sign EDMs as I'm an opposition whip but happy to raise issue directly with Minister if you email me
“@thefactoryse6: Thank you @heidi_mp for the after eights. We assumed they were for after 8am?”> indeed!
“@trinheadmaster: At Trinity Primary the most important event of today is the arrival of chicken eggs for hatching.”> when can I visit?!
Just two of the Lee Green team out on the #labourdoorstep today - lots of people in & a good response. http://t.co/pmaGgxHWIJ
Fabulous EuroVision party last night with Lewisham East Labour Party - superb organisation by @JamesJWalsh http://t.co/Wcj8YH5lV2
@SteveJTibbert that was me waving manically at you from the black corsa (just in case you were wondering). Hope you missed the rain!
@simon_hooks Martin claims he was the first (by a matter of seconds!)
Have just voted for @simon_hooks @Pat_Raven @mayorbullock (and for Cllr Jim Mallory & our Euro candidates of course!). Now to the post box.
@iMcKenzied now that's very eagle-eyed of you! Well spotted. I think there may be a version where he is more prominent ...
@themedicaldon ... they are still removing legal protection 4 hospitals which are not part of the failing trust in administration [2/2]
@themedicaldon TSA debate continues on Monday in Commons. Government tinkering at edges of Clause 119 but ... [1/2]
“@DeliciousMN: @heidi_mp @mayorbullock lovely to see u today hope u enjoyed your snack? #phoenixfestival http://t.co/fPfHgWn1uT”>Definitely!
@DeliciousMN @mayorbullock yes - lentils are the way forward I think!
Blustery Phoenix festival with @JanetDaby @CllrMarkIngleby @jgslater - campaigning on bedroom tax & energy bills. http://t.co/wBB3Je3O3B
@BromleyLabourUK I may be able to come down. Email me & will see what we can do. @leegreenlabour quite focused on getting local LibDems out!
MT “@LeeGreenLabour: Happy faces & a v positive #LabourDoorstep @Pat_Raven @simon_hooks http://t.co/iirFW22Kye”. Love this pic!
Just opened my letter from @LeeGreenLabour reminding me to return my postal vote! #VoteLabour http://t.co/KgIYpxnxCO
@Richardmblack will feed that back - thanks for getting in touch.
Two happy customers at advice surgery. Plugged away with a rehousing case & their family are now in their new home! http://t.co/xXaapk4p5G

Mammoth leaflet collation job underway in Catford - what a team! #VoteLabour May 22 http://t.co/EqiTfGqAnX
Really pleased to support @teamvlewisham #routestoroots campaign http://t.co/RobKSxYD5D
@TheMurkyDepths @bitoclass I think the minister was slightly confused but he did say he would address it
My speech on SouthEastern now on my website (with link to petition by @bitoclass re Lewisham station access): http://t.co/DmGUhqmNxf
@CatfordWI no worries - will hopefully welcome you back at some in the future!
@SiTrill sometimes it's all about "parliamentary persistence" although had hoped Minister might have had some answers this time.
@RADMags thanks - appreciate you saying so.
@JoePerryUK enjoyed this - fascinating stuff. You still around next Sunday?
@thomasweddell ps - hope that shortened link works. Seemed to be playing up to me - if you email, I can send it to you.
@thomasweddell ... be interested in this: http://t.co/EDSAx96BIt. Policy discussions still ongoing. Happy 2 respond in more detail by email.
@thomasweddell this week's policy announcement on longer term tenancies & cap on rent increases within a tenancy important. You may also ...

@JohannaBaxter @kevinbonavia @lewishamlabour many thanks for your support - much appreciated.
For Lewisham folk interested in the redevelopment around Lewisham Station, follow @NewLewisham - changes to station approach road imminent.
Love this pic by @JamesJWalsh of @uklabour #Blackheath team today @kevinbonavia @AmandadeRyk @GarethSiddorn http://t.co/qdsMhP1PuY
@packwood1 @cllral @elabdeslam super efficiency on the board was the key (oh, & that Tory Euro leaflet dropping just before we knocked!)
@IJMO1 that's very strange - we work v hard across the constituency. If you let me know which road they live on, I will investigate.
@nualajane really sorry not to make it today. Have had to reorganise my diary at last minute & have just run out of hours!
Good #labourdoorstep sessions in Catford & Lee Green. The Tory Euro election leaflet seemingly doing a great job firming up the Labour vote.
@AlanOlive1 @decmchugh75 didn't realise you were leaving Declan. What you going off to do?
@Manwithaview1 @bromleycollege she raises a very important issue! Really nice to see her again.
If you are fed up (like me) with the Lewisham station platform 4 gate being shut, sign this petition from @bitoclass http://t.co/ZdlYSaAW8L
@bitoclass I ran a petition on this about 4 years ago - I will send the link to your new one to all those who signed the original.
“@bitoclass: @heidi_mp On the subject of #Southeastern, you may like to sign and/or share this: http://t.co/ITHBrKVZat” DONE!
Hmm. Long day at the office. Definitely home time now.
MT “@BromleyCollege: thanks to @heidi_mp for Q&A with our students today http://t.co/tBqR2XR0Dj”> really intelligent (& tough!) questions!
@OperaCreep @sthlondonpress oops - well spotted. Should have picked that one up when I proof read it back to myself.
@Dimwot Hi Peter, I've received the email & you will get a response in due course.
My article for the @SthLondonPress today on supermarkets & the living wage: http://t.co/UM8OFISttL

Thanks to everyone who has sent comments about Southeastern trains. Sorry not to acknowledge all tweets individually - quite a lot of them!
@nualajane I will try to join you. Am really busy on Saturday but should be able to get to central London for 30 mins around 1.30pm.
@BernellRCN really good discussion - I enjoyed it. Nice to meet you too.
@lightandbubbly_ happy to receive emails on the subject if easier!

Oops - that last tweet should have referred to @Lina_Cankas ...
Called 4 Commons debate on Access to Work scheme after complaints from @linacankas & others re funding changes 4 sign language interpreters.
@Lina_Cankas thanks Lina, have just asked for a debate on this subject in business questions today. Other MPs concerned about this too.
@harrym26 grey - where you there too?
@magic_stag I have huge respect for long-serving MPs but also think newer members can bring fresh insight ...
In Commons for stop & search announcement - only two years after my Westminster Hall debate when I called for change: http://t.co/6epnZCagRO
"Father of the house" up at PMQs. Can't help but think the last person elected should be able to speak at will, not person here the longest.
Cameron useless at #PMQs on his botched Royal Mail sell-off: UK taxpayers ripped off while ‘priority investors’ cashed in.
@39_stephs I don't have further news on Leegate but I will seek another update from St Modwen and will share with you.

A long day on the #labourdoorstep - chips & a pickled egg from the Village Fish Bar in Blackheath is my reward though :-) Thu Apr 16 19:53:25 BST 2015

.@Se_Railway @networkrail can you please explain today's utter rail chaos? This can't keep happening. It's intolerable for 1000s of people. Mon Apr 13 08:53:18 BST 2015
@numb15 will do my best - am not subjected to it myself this morning due to election campaign but can see from twitter it's chaos. Mon Apr 13 08:44:59 BST 2015
@RosamundCox1 good to meet you. I do a fair amount of work on housing - here's an example of one speech I gave: http://t.co/gbm6uWDtLO Sun Apr 12 17:29:02 BST 2015

@jasoncaffrey that's a good question to which I don't know the answer immediately - I will see if can find out. Fri Apr 10 09:24:30 BST 2015
@jeanmarron not sure what happened there - sometimes you can totally inadvertently miss a door. Which road do you live on? Fri Apr 10 09:17:38 BST 2015
@jeanmarron that's very weird - are you on electoral register? Fri Apr 10 08:49:38 BST 2015
@clogsilk hmm - remember doing Hafton at some point last year but I'm not sure I've been in last few months - the team may have been though. Fri Apr 10 08:48:39 BST 2015
@clogsilk which road do you live on? Fri Apr 10 08:45:28 BST 2015
@clogsilk Julia & Nick live in constituency too - the roads of Lewisham East would be my mastermind specialist subject! Fri Apr 10 08:41:34 BST 2015

@PracticeYogaUK good to see you - albeit briefly! Wed Apr 08 21:43:42 BST 2015
@spook1956 that's not true at all. I can assure you I go to every single part of my constituency. Will look out for your email. Wed Apr 08 21:40:48 BST 2015
@HitherGreenLee ... to be assured a late response would be acceptable. He gave me that assurance. (2/2) Wed Apr 08 21:39:20 BST 2015
@HitherGreenLee this is an important issue & I want to look at all documentation properly. That's why I spoke to Head of Planning ... (1/2) Wed Apr 08 21:38:30 BST 2015
@HitherGreenLee I've spoken with Head of Planning & he said responses after formal consultation deadline will still be considered. Wed Apr 08 21:35:51 BST 2015
@spook1956 email me your address & I will knock. We are trying to cover the whole constituency but have 42,000 doors to get to so it's hard. Wed Apr 08 21:33:56 BST 2015

@blogmywiki I think you need to be firm in order to be fair - for example in enforcement of decisions on someone's immigration status. Sun Mar 29 09:31:45 BST 2015
@blogmywiki I know I've already sent you one link, but here's another in which I try to strike that balance http://t.co/TIcmDtjsB4 (2/2) Sat Mar 28 20:55:08 GMT 2015
@blogmywiki I get what you are saying but I do think you can have firm policy whilst not doing the latter (1/2) Sat Mar 28 20:53:52 GMT 2015
@aroundmyblock am trying to get a meeting with the Chair of Governors as I am v concerned about the proposals. Sat Mar 28 19:23:16 GMT 2015

Minor timetable changes from SouthEastern http://t.co/TmCgdA1aye - tinkers at the edges but doesn't address basic shortage of carriages. Wed Mar 04 08:15:38 GMT 2015
Ridiculous that less than 1 in 5 Cannon St trains are 12 car when millions of ££ spent on extending platforms (2/2). Wed Mar 04 08:09:33 GMT 2015
Not at all convinced that @Se_Railway proposed timetable changes help that much. We need longer trains full stop. (1/2) Wed Mar 04 08:08:56 GMT 2015
@geof24 @bbclondon949 that could be a factor in some cases but lots of women just can't afford to go back to work. Wed Mar 04 08:06:16 GMT 2015

@TKViews not the ones who come to my advice surgery but that's obviously only one snap-shot. Thu Feb 26 14:51:56 GMT 2015

@kevinbonavia @vickyannand ... other services to the Cannon St ones. Longer term - we need to get our hands on more carriages full stop ... Sun Feb 22 17:21:02 GMT 2015

@jaca12345 it's awful, I know. Not sure if you saw my recent speech in parliament. Will be following up with minister http://t.co/gsvDGqLb5M Fri Feb 13 07:27:34 GMT 2015
@BarrySheerman you should talk to Antonio Rizzo at Lewisham (library service manager) - they've done this with some libraries already. Fri Feb 13 07:22:40 GMT 2015
.@LivingWageUK accreditation in pride of place on the wall @LewishamCouncil - still more to do but great start. http://t.co/wzZxCGsqbk Mon Feb 09 08:59:28 GMT 2015

@mtpennycook @davidlammy @fionatwycross @tulipsiddiq thanks everyone - great turnout for a cold Thursday afternoon :-) Thu Feb 05 22:44:11 GMT 2015
@GWX66 best summary of my views about housing is probably a speech I gave in the commons last year: http://t.co/gbm6uWDtLO Wed Feb 04 23:21:54 GMT 2015
@GWX66 I think I'm ruby red (deep red with a sparkle) but sounds like we need to have a few debates about your vote not his?! Wed Feb 04 23:06:56 GMT 2015
@BAJDixon I prefer the colour red personally - perhaps they could change colour at constituency boundaries ... Wed Feb 04 09:00:21 GMT 2015
@SarahChampionMP still haven't seen it - am going to have to watch on catch up as by the sounds of it, you were quite rightly the star :-) Wed Feb 04 08:53:56 GMT 2015
@sheshrugged @networkrail I don't know but good question - if you email me, would be happy to try to find out. Wed Feb 04 08:18:34 GMT 2015
@sheshrugged I find the trains so awful in rush hour, I now get the 321 & 453 bus into Westminster (takes longer but less stressful) Wed Feb 04 08:16:40 GMT 2015
@sheshrugged it's awful, I know. Not sure if you saw my debate in parliament last week about need for 12 car trains? http://t.co/gsvDGqLb5M Wed Feb 04 08:15:11 GMT 2015
@drdickdixon or checking my emails (one of the two!!). My mum won't be impressed ... Wed Feb 04 07:16:37 GMT 2015
My speech today calling for greater transparency about listed companies which pay a living wage & those that don't: http://t.co/aCGZ0ewhCa Tue Feb 03 14:35:29 GMT 2015
Tomorrow I am presenting a bill to Parliament to require listed companies to report annually on % of staff paid below a living wage. Mon Feb 02 22:34:49 GMT 2015
@sjrmfc @mattcelthamsth in an ideal world, we would get new stock but I'd take anything if it meant longer Cannon St trains! Mon Feb 02 19:00:47 GMT 2015
@Mushk_ which road do you live on? Will let you know if we are coming round again soon. 42,000 doors to knock on so hard to get to everyone! Mon Feb 02 18:58:11 GMT 2015
Pleased to be at the Catford & Bromley Synagogue for the visit of the @chiefrabbi - lovely atmosphere as always. http://t.co/M9NlQgo9nz Sun Feb 01 16:35:08 GMT 2015

Of course there are millions of other dedicated super public servants I didn't mention. Doing a fantastic job looking after the rest of us.

@MoorlandsLabour @OwenJones84 #bedroomtax #foodbanks #zerohours #ESA #childpoverty #fuelpoverty  #pensionerpoverty = Its a "class"issue !!!
@OwenJones84 Cmde my intervention in the #foodbankdebate clarified the Tory pedalled myth that only unemployed people were using Foodbanks
Tweet predictors sometimes make you look foolish, but it's the message that counts, 500,000 people ARE hungry ( no A) this time #foodbanks
The Tories complained that Labour were making the food bank debate Political !! You better believe it, 500,000 Hungary people might agree !!
DWP Minister Esther McVey has spent far too much time with That IDS. You should listen to her ranting on about how well this bunch are doing
Desperate to speak in the Foodbanks debate to highlight this national scandal. Tories noisily out in force ignoring acute UK poverty levels
Superb evening in the speakers residence tonight organised by @SRTRC_England a fantastic organisation that deserves our unswerving support
@GetTog_Morpeth you have my full support. Doing a great job for the people of Morpeth. Well Done !!
@TonySlevin @tonymahercfmeu it's so confusing. England hammered the Aussies earlier in 2013, the Aussies win later on, oh well a draw is OK.

Seriously concerned about the future of SA following the death of Mandela.ANC have a lot of work to do to build community confidence.

Im so so puzzled can anyone give me 1 reason why insurance companies think that giving mesothelioma victims 75% of what they deserve is fair
@northerntuc this is so serious. This is 2013 how can this be allowed to happen ?. Couple this up with the adult life expectancy rate !!!!
A somber mood during the ministerial statement on the Glasgow Helicopter tragedy. Less than 10 GVT backbenchers present, an insult to all !!

Lib Dems absolutely furious at Cameron's announcement here in PMQs to roll back green taxes. He said vote blue to get green. Ha ha ha
Today's PMQs should be electric, top of the bill some might say, a major row is on the cards, very taxing for the PM. Shocking situation tho
As a member of the Energy select committee I look forward to hearing on 29th Oct why energy companies have hiked up their prices #scandalous
@LiamLavery1 metro delayed at 9,East Coast delayed and then terminated after 41/2h. Train to Grantham bus to Peterborough still travelling
Infuriating,maddening,frustrating, sitting on a stationary train. All train routes from the NE to London blocked. Afternoon business OFF.
@JakeReesMogg certainly not Jacob, it's more likely to be Nick Clegg in disguise trying to find some old voters or supporters for 2015.
@PaulHeatonSolo Paul can you remember being at Ashington during the great miners strike in 1984/85.
If you walk like a duck, quack like a duck and swim like a duck...well you're likely to be a duck.....Jeremy Browne you're a errm.......Tory

Interesting visit to the 111 centre/ Northern Doctors Urgent Care unit at Gosforth last night. Should be an integral part of the NHS !!
@JohnHealey_MP and I Thoroughly enjoyed debating a motion of no confidence in this Gvt at The Cambridge Union last night. #Victory4Labour ;-
Just quizzed the energy minister on why the Gvt doesn't side with the consumer this winter rather than defending the energy companies.
@tom_watson @jeremycorbyn @Islingtonlabour so they tell me Tom, their reputation of a great constituency party precedes them.Looking forward
Topping off a very busy day by addressing my good friend @jeremycorbyn constituency AGM @Islingtonlabour lots to discuss and debate.

Well done to every single @ashington_fc player today. Lots of injuries and lots of pressure matched only by lots of footballing spirit.
What's this rumour about the the Hon Simon Burns MP putting himself forward for Deputy Speaker of the house.....quite amusing I think.
Eds bold announcement on a energy price freeze has been greatly welcomed by those in fuel poverty among others. Mandelson keep your nose out
This week will be critical in the long passage of history between the Trade Unions and the Labour Party.See sense strengthen the link.
It's so galling to watch Shirley Williams say that the Bedroom tax was simply a mistake.The Lib Dems supported this ! What about the misery!
@scurloguechamp there is absolutely no appetite for the privatisation of Royal Mail, the public are in total opposition. Pure Tory Dogma.
Excellent turn out of Trade Union Reps and Northern MPs @northerntuc thorough discussions on Privatisation of the Fire Service & Royal Mail

@glenoglaza1 Mr Oglaza strangely I expected more from you.Privatisation of Royal Mail is a major concern to 1000's of hardworking UKcitizens
Lets be crystal clear privatisation makes a few millionaires while costing millions of ordinary people much more. #greedyenergycompanies
@jenn_lucraft @scrappyaries let me just say that the TU reps I know are first rate people seeking the best they can for their members.
In the Transparency of Lobbying, Non Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill part 3. Like part 1  & 2 it's an utter farce.
@RicHolden so why do they accept Cameron's continued hatred of the trade unions, it's blind hatred for goodness sake. It's his obsession.
Now that the shoutings over let's focus our sights firmly on the real enemy, the Tories who ultimately despise the unions and its members.
Comradely greetings and a message of solidarity to all delegates attending the @TUCnews conference. Unity is Strength. United we stand !!!

Waiting to get called in the gagging bill, the more detail or indeed lack of it I hear the more I totally despair at this nasty nasty GVT.
The Gvts  #lobbyingbill is the most ruthless attack on civil liberties and freedom of speech that I can remember. A Government gagging order
Great reception in the state rooms tonight to celebrate @jeremycorbyn 30 years in parliament. Well done to a proper Labour parliamentarian

The Corporation Tax questioning on the Big Six energy companies were raised during todays open session of the EEC select committee.
1 of the Big 6 energy companies paid NO (zero) corporation tax in any of the last 3 years.At a time when millions are facing fuel poverty.
Outraged to learn that 3 of the big 6 energy companies enjoys corporation tax rates significantly less than would be expected. #fuelpoverty
@stevecavalier @kevin_maguire thanks for the kind offer, but you only need counselling when you don't understand the problem. Think I do !!
@Kevin_Maguire wish I could take defeat graciously but sorry I can't, just shows what happens when you buy bargain basement products in bulk
@Kevin_Maguire @ianclucas one things for sure if we draw so will you ;-)" No chance. Mags are up for this one.

@northerntuc Congratulations to all at the Northern TUC conference and dinner. Always great to meet fellow trade unionists from our region.
It really will be a "Tough and Tearful week" for the families and entire communities savaged decimated & destroyed as a matter of conviction
On the doorstep in Wansbeck this morning. Tears & desperation about the #bedroomtax. NO properties available! People "Trapped & Taxed" !!!
Surprisingly tonight Menzies Campbell is the strongest most physcophantical  Thatcher supporter on @bbcquestiontime #sheepinwolfsclothing
Ken Clarke will do well to remember on @bbcquestiontime that the miners strike was not about money but about jobs for our children.
@IainDale Here's your official invitation to visit the North East to experience first hand the devastation caused by Baroness Thatcher.
@jmccabe09 there's nothing more deplorable than the abuse of a child.Absolutely zero tolerance to child abuse in what ever evil form.
There's no one around at this time of night I'm sitting here thinking of the destruction the thatcher Gvt brought upon our communities.
It would be cowardly for me not to comment on today's news.No tears from me nor the mining communities destroyed by MT we R #theenemywithin

 http://t.co/ulBjTTpoNH
Hoping to speak in the jobseekers bill. The GVT should never be seen as above the law.denying jobseekers of £130 m is quite frankly obscene.
A Lib Dem Cllr in Ashington allegedly said of the #bedroomtax "it's ok it's only two bottles of wine and a packet of fags" #utterlyappalling
Despicable act.Tories just pushed through the halving of consultation period for workers facing comp redun.Not even debated on the floor
Just questioned minister on the need to have full support or employees for mutualisation of Fire & rescue services @fbunational - No answer!
This concerns me greatly.The ability of any GVT to raid a persons bank account.I wonder ? Could this ever happen here http://t.co/CXQxtU8F7E

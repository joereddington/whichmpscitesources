@jrmaidment Ask why he'd change coalition approach of balancing books with 80% cuts + 20% tax rises? Tories plan bigger, longer cuts instead Mon Apr 27 13:23:08 BST 2015
@NigelGroom @BenCTFC Loan player with a history at Whaddon Road though.  I thought he made a fantastic effort on Saturday.  Cruel game. Mon Apr 27 12:29:40 BST 2015
@mpmwilko Be fair Max. They scaremonger about SNP too. Ironic since one thing that cd scare Scots out of UK after all wd be Tory majority.. Sun Apr 26 21:37:04 BST 2015
@cateanna1 @MelGladwin I'll let him know! Sun Apr 26 21:15:11 BST 2015
@joabbess @mjb222 Tories are doing a huge amount by call centre, direct mail and billboard. Conveniently not on local election expenses. Sun Apr 26 21:09:18 BST 2015
@cheltenhamlady Thank you! Sun Apr 26 20:27:33 BST 2015

@pat_thesplat Be fair though, we did try to change the voting system. But failing that it really does help Tories here to vote Green or Lab. Sat Apr 25 12:59:49 BST 2015
@CheltTory Fiction. Chelt was the first seat I applied for, way back in 90s. Never hidden other contests - all on my website! Sat Apr 25 12:57:36 BST 2015
@jameswhartonuk @B_Carlton @markpack James you know that's not true. It took less time at each stage than most bills! Sat Apr 25 12:51:50 BST 2015

@CheltTory No Tory at key 2013 mtg on Chelt A&E to take my pic. No support from Cotswolds Tory MP or Chelt candidate, only @paulcotswolds Sat Apr 25 00:50:39 BST 2015
@Nick_1453 @studentjourno14 No problem with criticising Labour economic policy (well deserved) but media abuse going far beyond that. Sat Apr 25 00:35:56 BST 2015
@throwonedropone Possibly a slight simplification! @cheltlibdems win local elections all over town. Sat Apr 25 00:33:47 BST 2015
@B_Carlton @markpack @jameswhartonuk I didn't. It reached H of Lords after passing all Commons stages. How could I have tried to block it?! Sat Apr 25 00:32:40 BST 2015

@Trafficplans @BBCGlos @matt_babbage Tory county council has already been given govt money to do this!! Why should Chelt subsidise county?! Fri Apr 24 23:47:36 BST 2015

@PGannaway1 That's for personal casework. Hustings & events in Chelt no prob, & happy to meet if you want. Tue Apr 14 07:26:31 BST 2015
@lor3 Why? Almost everyone parks on road in Chelt and bill allowed sensible exemptions to be agreed. Tue Apr 14 07:23:41 BST 2015
@Beccabell05 @JohnDinwoodie Or reality? Bookies make Greens 100/1. Every vote for them instead of LibDem in Chelt helps to elect the Tory. Tue Apr 14 07:22:30 BST 2015
@bennycblanco Apology for that. Very many emails at the moment though. Suggest you email again and phone if no reply after a while. Tue Apr 14 07:18:41 BST 2015

#CamebandMiliron not inspiring tonight. Irony is bookies make coalition or co-operation much likelier than either of them getting majority. Thu Mar 26 23:25:59 GMT 2015
@piphilthims sure it was 2002? Thu Mar 26 23:15:23 GMT 2015
@suzLD @_BrianMay_  He has better hair, I have to admit. @katebloomhair must try harder!! Thu Mar 26 23:14:59 GMT 2015
@Mall110782 Quite. County brought us incinerator, school admissions crisis, street parking charges hitting small retailers.. Poor record. Thu Mar 26 23:12:34 GMT 2015
@librarydonna Yes! I said I didn't recall the last time the kids borrowed a book. My point was about changing nature of libraries & reading Thu Mar 26 23:09:32 GMT 2015
@tintiddle Ta. Good we agree on importance of libraries anyway! Thu Mar 26 23:05:53 GMT 2015
@JoeSucksmith True. Still think it has advantages. But we'd have had no £10k tax cut, no pupil premium, prob no 0.7%, no equal marriage.. Thu Mar 26 22:59:48 GMT 2015
@MrMirth @caronmlindsay @trevdick @duncanhames @joswinson Very few but it wasn't entirely a party vote. Q a few Tories in our lobby. Thu Mar 26 22:55:33 GMT 2015

@MirandaFrance1 I agree. Free access to internet now pretty vital for adults on low incomes too. Thu Mar 26 22:09:47 GMT 2015
@RealLonesamurai @GFirstLEP Mmm. Let me know about your experience: email martin@martinhorwood.net Thu Mar 26 22:08:18 GMT 2015

@tintiddle I know, that's why I campaign hard to save them in my constituency. What do you think I said?! Thu Mar 26 18:24:59 GMT 2015
@librarydonna I said at recent @Soc_of_Authors hustings that libraries must be defended but not simply about borrowing books anymore. Thu Mar 26 18:22:35 GMT 2015

@LindaHurrell OK... Wed Mar 18 18:15:51 GMT 2015
@Independent Included in new £1.25bn commitment in today's #Budget2015. Mental health a big priority for @LibDems Wed Mar 18 14:46:43 GMT 2015
And another really important @LibDems win from #Budget2015: £1.25bn committed to children's mental health services and for new mums Wed Mar 18 14:43:37 GMT 2015
@mpmwilko Indeed. Likely to just inflate prices giving completely temporary benefit. Wed Mar 18 13:55:54 GMT 2015

@ChrisBramall Fair point. Easy to hypothecate to begin with but remaining budgets under more pressure. Mon Mar 16 23:38:59 GMT 2015
@alleycat58uk No. I'm not in favour of fees. But nothing repaid until earning £21k & only then according to income, richer grads pay more. Mon Mar 16 23:37:07 GMT 2015

@thedoctorkhan @KellyMarieLD @DuncanStott No reason it couldn't be anywhere in parliament apart from set-up cost & inevitable Mail headline Tue Mar 03 18:34:33 GMT 2015
@Malabus No. But I do think we need to take a serious look at Parliament's financing & income-generating potential if it does go ahead. Tue Mar 03 18:32:59 GMT 2015

@Martin_Horwood What an excellent name! Thu Feb 26 23:13:40 GMT 2015
Delighted that @cheltlibdems on @CheltenhamBC voted tonight for new developments to be wired for superfast #broadband to EU standard. Thu Feb 26 23:02:42 GMT 2015
@carlsalter @LabourEoin No they didn't. No mention of second jobs or incomes in motion. Perhaps because biggest earner is, er, exPM G Brown? Thu Feb 26 22:56:10 GMT 2015
@JohnDinwoodie That's awful. If you contact @FGW do copy me in on martin@martinhorwood.net Thu Feb 26 22:52:21 GMT 2015

@louiseseeley Mr Healy mentioned this & does sound fascinating. But already q busy day. Can you give details to my office on 224889? Wed Feb 25 19:15:39 GMT 2015
@piphilthims Prob important we vote in person but why we can't use smartcards instead of queuing for 20mins, heaven knows (sorry, vicar!) Wed Feb 25 19:12:31 GMT 2015

@piphilthims @justallianceuk Just realised that tweet quite ambiguous - I mean I refused to support them as the whip encouraged us to do. Tue Feb 24 23:48:48 GMT 2015
@littleangeldeb Thank you, I'll have to head home and watch it on iPlayer! Tue Feb 24 22:59:59 GMT 2015

@jfwduffield @FGW See your point. Chelt not all regency elegance & private schools. But visitor marketing inevitably a bit skewed.. Tue Feb 24 18:02:21 GMT 2015
@Cheltpoetfest Can't we have two or three each? Maybe time-limited? Picking one is impossible! 📚📖📕 Tue Feb 24 17:57:57 GMT 2015
@PGannaway1 @bpas1968 Indeed. Ring 224889 for an appointment and we can discuss face to face. Tue Feb 24 17:53:45 GMT 2015

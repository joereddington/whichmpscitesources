Vibixa workers demand better redundancy package from Weetabix | Gloucestershire Echo http://t.co/f4pxffzuiF via @Glosecho #weetabix
@PeteSims1 I already have!
@John_A_Porter I'm afraid I'm not in parliament today.
Thank you! @JubilateChelt @CheltenhamTH I'm looking forward to it.
@publicsectorpm @GlosEcho Only just. Pretty incompetent of Tories to talk down their chances when they clearly could have won #Rochester
@SkyNews Not sure why you keep saying LD vote in #Rochester went to UKIP. Far more likely to have gone Tory to stop UKIP.
@JeremyPound71 @JTomlinsonMP @edvaizey @RobertBuckland @duncanhames Indeed! New Honeybourne line north of Chelt to reconnect us to Oxford

@Nick_d_Williams Actually we have cut beer duty two years running!
@wkt271j Thank you! We can discuss fees over a pint sometime - I'd still abolish them given the chance but no such chance imminent.
Thanks @UniofGlos for exciting #fashion course showcase yesterday. Great partners @CheltFashionWk @Superdry too. http://t.co/X4vepvkDI6
Blimey! #fairdeal4yourlocal vote is won. Good day for parliament.
Just voted for a #fairdeal4yourlocal to give tenants of big pubcos a fairer deal. Looks like a right vote..
@AndyYouell @FGW Indeed. And the cost doesn't help.
@MikeEcoPR I hear complaints from your rd, Ken Ave, GPk Rd, Eldorados. @FGW have added spaces but I'd like more, in consult'n with residents
@FGW Thank you
Thanks @DanPapworth. Years of work to get us this far so very important  next COPs deliver a global deal.
Just had to park in nearby road at Chelt Spa. @FGW still roping off 20+ spaces 2 days after 3 day Open races, 9 days after first closure.
PM replies to me that European Union committed to global climate deal alongside US & China. UK would have no such clout outside EU.
@ManpreetMellhi @BBCGlos Well done! Brilliant result. And fantastic total for @BBCCiN #cupcakes #pudsey #yum
@CllrChrisMartin @swilliamsmp @BristolLibDems Thanks for the fish & chips, fiendish quiz & great political chat yesterday evening. #aare
@seanwhatford @vibixa_weetabix I met with union this week to do just that. Shocked that Vibixa & Weetabix management won't meet me. V poor.

@PeteSims1 Will do. That's a longstanding LibD policy. It's too easy to cut non-statutory services in times like these.
@woodfieldprop @bbc5live Yes, apologies for that. I was given the wrong time..
Very excited that a little bit of Cheltenham will be winging its way around the sun for centuries.. http://t.co/Vh0fafVTt0
@WeAreTheLights @jrmaidment I replied earlier but as you tweet anonymously it's tricky to reply at length. Do email martin@martinhorwood.net
@kb32904 Yes but if you're going to call someone a halfwit, you're just adding to that disconnect if you haven't done your research.
@merleneemerson @WW1CLC  My honour. It's a little-known story that deserves to be more widely heard.
@TiedPubs Since I'm one of the movers of the amendment, I think you can count on my support!
@Nick_d_Williams Indeed. Another reason why constant reorganisation in the NHS rarely saves the money it is supposed to save.
@BelindaBG That's very kind, thank you!
http://t.co/0DvBlfl9aN
@kb32904 That's very rude. And there's no legislation required for the EAW or weren't you actually listening to the debate?

Good to see #Cheltenham's most famous son on this list RT @Independent: http://t.co/QaRFXsC6BR http://t.co/o27d01MVRD #Holst
@CTFCofficial He was just getting warmed up! Q frustrating just glimpsing talents like Koby, Eusebio, Marquis.. Still, onwards & upwards.
@richardaoneill Not q fair on @Fastershire - I bemoaned miscommunication, mixed use of postcodes, cabinets etc. Not attributing blame. Yet.
@RightToAHome @P3Charity That's great to hear.
@WeAreTheLights I have commented q a bit on need for environmental & social standards to be protected, any threat to NHS rules out.
@cogload519 @cheltlibdems Come on up!
Thanks @mbduk. I raised #Cheltenham #broadband issues in debate yesterday & in PM's Qs today. Promising replies but campaign continues.
@seanwhatford @weetabix My pleasure. Looking forward to hearing back from @weetabix CEO on when we can discuss #Vibixa
Just contributed to #badgercull debate highlighting risk to Gloucestershire cattle of second failed cull. Time to follow the evidence.
@BobConstantine Let's be kind: maybe he was listening as he promised to act on new developments & to 'knock heads together' on roll-out

@HarryHayfield Hmm. Not quite as punchy. But take your point we mustn't be too casual with language.
@RightToAHome Then really important you speak to me or my caseworkers. Or @CheltenhamYMCA @P3Charity & CHAC for advice, maybe accommodation
@Matt_Link @Cheltenham151 @Cheltenham214 Basically @Fastershire says hands are tied. Real mess. Raising in parliament on Monday.
@WeAreTheLights Actually rents coming down in Cheltenham right now but take your point. We have to protect remaining green space too.
@CllrKSudbury @RossHenley I think Echo first to admit it wasn't v scientific! Does show it's a two-horse race in #Cheltenham though.
@HarryHayfield @samaritans What other term would have been better to convey that idea?
@seanyranson I don't, generally!
@RobJHopkins @BWMPromo @spiraltastic @RecordShopChelt @iolondon   Total obstruction like that already a criminal offence (patchily enforced)
@Nick_d_Williams Er, except I didn't vote against recall of MPs.
@Durangokid0 Indeed. That's why I didn't vote against recall of MPs.
Smaller constituents looking scarier than usual tonight.. #Halloween in #Cheltenham http://t.co/gJVfvVMNpl
@RightToAHome Definitely call 224889 for an appointment

@RightToAHome @geoffscameras Wasn't aware we were in confrontation! Always happy to meet as well as tweet - call 224889 for appointment.
@Mike__Yu It's an honour. Let's hope there is a peaceful solution.

@sheshyp Happy to publicly clarify that I made my opposition even to one SEV in Cheltenham very clear to councillors.
@stevehurcombe @Fastershire @Cheltenham151 @Cheltenham214 I'll add it to the list. Pretty serious for small businesses based there.

@jrmaidment Sort of but not a poll itself. No-one in Cheltenham questioned. Wouldn't pass for a poll at YouGov, IpsosMORI etc

@jrmaidment Not really a poll though Jack. Just applies national swing to 2010 result. No-one in #Cheltenham asked their opinion.
@FionaBoothNo1 @peter_clegg @gloscommenergy @edwarddaveymp Blimey parliamentary questions don't get answered that fast! Power of Twitter!!
@DBanfieldMUA I'll look out for it.
@greenerglos Couldn't attend climate march sorry. I was laying a wreath at Battle of Britain ceremony but glad great global event went well.
@scoote1972 If you also move to a single tier of local government, keeping powers local, then we'd have fewer politicians not more.
Thank you @GreenLibDems. I'm really honoured.

@CassieUWE @yoursu @yoursugreen I missed you there! Hope you're still giving MPs a hard time..
@hocwatch @davidtcdavies @HouseofTwits But OK for London, Welsh and N Irish MPs? And different MPs voting on different bits of bills?!
@scoote1972 And an English parliament in London would be a decentralisation to people in the west how exactly?
@GlosCAN I can't sorry but hope all the events worldwide go well. There's still no more important issue. #climatechangewalk
@PNLJames @David_Cameron @Ed_Miliband @nick_clegg Absolutely right, and a written constitution too.

@PhotoGlow Changing clocks doesn't create more light sadly. Shifts morning school runs into darkness so I'm still v dubious.
@paulwrites It is very worrying. Defra doesn't really seem to be listening to scientific evidence either.
@Henry_Sloan @BBCWestminHour @JakeReesMogg Almost always have three so suspect it was availability not conspiracy.

@PeteSims1 Have done. I think this is longstanding LibDem policy.
@germal_martin Happy to RT and visited all @CWGC sites in Cheltenham recently. V moving.
@MeSianey I hope so too. Sad we had to use a LibD private member's bill when this is actually government policy.
@thesasgeek You're welcome. People feeling seriously let down by superfast roll-out.
Beautiful double rainbow over Chelt. Pot of Gold looks roughly in Battledown, which is about right! http://t.co/elGMzV3cli
@bbcglos new players, new kit, sharp new goalie, new captain, louder crowd & whole new script at Whaddon Rd! #CTFC dominate AND win at home.
Great start to opening home game at Whaddon Road. Focussed #CTFC lead 1-0 but could easily have been more. Well done @CTFCofficial

12:00 today on the Prom! @CheltenhamTH and @winstonswish join forces for a @GWR attempt at simultaneous mass jive.
@B_Carlton No, honestly, I didn't live, work or represent ward 100mi away when I was selected! And really born & brought up in #Cheltenham.
@Iain_33 @ComeDineWithMe Too much pressure! Sticking to politics..
@JohnYoung84 @DavidWardMP Sadly I think this will be cause for disciplinary action by the party.
@PensionsforLife Already have.
@cheltenhamlady @dialacabchelt I'd happily look into that. Sounds v odd.
@PaulRobertsFoto @PancreaticCanUK It includes quite critical take on NCRI research funds allocation. Would like to check their view first.
@NCSPButterfly It was a pleasure to meet everyone and hear about your plans to help the Butterfly Garden. Good luck!
@dukewhitethin and again today in Foreign Office questions.
It was great to see @The_100project. Inspiring & moving but very personal too.
@thesasgeek I'd welcome that. Reveals a major hole in BT strategy.
@NCSPButterfly Really enjoyed it. And very impressed.
@JonathanSindall  Looking quite promising. Negotiations with owner ongoing..
@B_Carlton Er, except he wasn't! I'd really drop this line of argument if I were you!!
@B_Carlton I didn't say having stood elsewhere makes you less local. Living, working & representing somewhere else entirely does though!
@YoungGlos I'll look forward to seeing everyone.
@Dommie23 Sadly there are more & they'll continue into autumn. Severn Trent say 'more efficient' to do all work at once. For them maybe..

@sofaofthedamned That's ok, my surgeries are Friday evenings so that people can make it after work.
@sofaofthedamned martin@martinhorwood.net.
@B_Carlton .. and are you sure Alex was born in Cheltenham? His website says 'raised in Foxcote' which is nowhere in Chelt that I know!
@B_Carlton I stood in Oxford & Westminster when I lived & worked in each. Came home to live & work in Chelt years before standing as MP.
@JohnYoung84 Oh I think they do..
@Billi_jade I was joining my family who'd been queuing with everyone & were getting a bit stressed! Great shows eh?
@sofaofthedamned Happy to meet. Call 224889 for an appointment if you'd like.
@MrArtnada It's a temporary fix to protect your safety & Nick Clegg still calling for review of oversight & scrutiny anyway.
@lisaleetyping @SueKelsoRyan @CheltenhamAgent @moosepr @VeriteLouise @regleetv You're welcome!
@PensionsforLife Least I could do. Good luck with the campaign.
@MeSianey @ConcernVoices Done. Important campaign.
@acet2001 Let's hope Nicky Morgan aggravates everybody less.
@acet2001 I agree actually. He was a rather fine Foreign Secretary, not actually too Eurosceptic in practice and genuinely nice bloke.
@AndrewChard2 It was a pleasure to see you in Parliament. I'm sorry it was rather rushed in the end. Drop in again.
@B_Carlton @JamesMacCleary Er, councillor for Hammersmith's Addison ward (Labour gain ironically!) until May.
@JonathanSindall @JamesMacCleary I can sense the shirty emails from Slough and Hammersmith LibDems already.. lovely places both of them!

@rattlecans I would have voted yes since it increased childcare payments, but we didn't go to a vote.
@trishteachermum Today's parliamentary business: first, a bill to increase childcare payments, then a debate on respect for Commons staff.

@JeremyPound71 We aim to please!
@thesweetcheat Thank you!
@Nick_d_Williams @CllrKSudbury Nick, the entire county cabinet is Tory! They run the council. Who's trying to pass the buck to who?!
@Catniptwoshoes Already quite a lot of inquiries underway but will consider.
@LaurenceHorton @GlosEcho   Accountable to parliament & bound by strict laws. Can't & don't do mass surveillance, which would be unethical.
@Nick_d_Williams @CllrKSudbury Tories certainly do run the county and hold all decision-making cabinet positions
@BigH155 See many previous tweets. Email me on martin@martinhorwood.net and I can give you chapter & verse
@Phill_1970 @CheltenhamBC capped car park charges but county council upped on-street fees so you'd need to challenge Tories on that!
@Phill_1970 @CheltenhamBC using sustainable transport money to improve bus journey. Could help but Glos Rd quite a challenge..
@Nick_d_Williams Sadly that's the Tory-run county council but it should certainly be a campaigning priority for @cheltlibdems
Hi @MelGladwin Paul Baker @cheltlibdems 861, Con 767, UKIP 154, Green 46, Labour 46. LibD gain so #cheltelection LD+2, Con -1, indep -1

@numnum73 Thanks for your support. @gdcampaigns offering me lots of helpful advice.
@BHGaradia @gdcampaigns @livingstreets That's the idea, yes. Local exemptions where councils think its sensible.
@kemerton1 @AllGolds @drmarwank I saw that result! Absolutely fantastic.
@DanielBaker_eu Thanks for your support. It does seem to be epidemic in Cheltenham. V selfish.
@PaulRobertsFoto @PancreaticCanUK V sorry about your mum. Will certainly look at EDM.

@hannahs_a_man Have done. Thanks for pointing it out! Minister Lord Faulks also gave q positive response to LibD Baroness Barker yesterday.
Stunning stat from @NetworkRail: now 1.5bn passenger journeys a year from 761m in 1995. Highest total since 1920s. More capacity urgent!
@hannahs_a_man Thanks for telling me - yes, I'll sign immediately. Positive response from govt in Lords yesterday too.

@CuriousRalph Thanks. It was a very interesting evening.
@JonathanSindall @RoryStewartUK I didn't. We must leave scope for courts to make intelligent judgement

@Ruthjfj I think that must be a Eurosceptic plot to derail the European Union!
@jfwduffield Funny, I could have sworn it was the people of sovereign, independent Ukraine waving the European flag on the #Maidan.
@wspauk Happy to discuss. One of many suggested though!
@MattMarklew A few wider environmental, planning and other issues under consideration but top two prob noise & pavement parking.
@gdcampaigns Certainly on my list. It's quite an issue in #Cheltenham.
@cheltandy @LibDems Blimey. Poor old Labour. You wait till you see series three. Bad omen for Miliband!
@Ruthjfj Hmm. But the mad king is dead - or at least he's been moved elsewhere..

@Nick_d_Williams Agree we have to clearly define circumstances for recall so it isn't left to colleagues' discretion.

@guardiannews @AndrewChard2 @cheltandy Typical Graudian! Bit poor it's still wrong on the website even now..
@andraghafory Takea second look. It wasn't insulting about Romania! It was gently teasing our dear chums in UKIP.
My Mum just voted for @ConchitaWurst in our in-house poll! I think he/she may win.. #Eurovision2014
@PeterFrings surely you actually have to listen to something or read it for it to count as eavesdropping?
@piphilthims Pretend you're studying culture or politics! Vote Belarus, pitch up there in 2015 & spark a revolution!  #Eurovision2014

@CW641 @malarianomoreuk @LPNorthover @Lord_Collins @hilarybennmp @markdurkan They bit me when I was India supporting development & ecology!
@rodleach2 @CTC_Cyclists Steady! Suggest asking http://t.co/G2OaKQFkCf about my support for cycling. @mpmwilko equally keen. Happy to talk.
@CllrJWhitehouse Sorry but no. Our rail lines here groaning under capacity pressure & I don't want UK left without 21st C railway.
@lelliejayne Yes, definitely. Have raised issues relating to diagnosis, awareness and support on behalf of constituents for years now
My Cotswolds Tory neighbour Geoffrey C-Brown backs HS2 in Commons debate, sees big shift from car to rail. Rare unity on a transport issue!
@FrasersFudj @RobertaLSmart Indeed. Trying not to be so prescriptive in curriculum now but should be strongly encouraged. Fudge fab, thanks!

@Farecare1 @AgeUKGlos Thanks and apologise to Rochelle! I must have misheard her name. She did a great job anyway.
@thesasgeek via my office - 224889 or martin@martinhorwood.net - if you don't find out from @BTCare. There are other urban blackspots too.
Great Easter fete today at St Luke's til 1pm in aid of @AgeUKGlos. Well done Michelle (centre) from @Farecare1! http://t.co/8oTSUsNVt2
@w_wilkinsonn I wondered that but there aren't that many working phone boxes to choose from these days!
@annamac33 I agree. Far from whole solution to illegal arms trading but important next step.
@FameLabUK @jimalkhalili @marklythgoe @DrAliceRoberts @RogerHighfield Way too short notice, sorry, but have a really great time!
@chrismartin_uk Good idea. Thanks.
@BadgerGoalie Bit complicated to explain on Twitter - can you book an appointment on 224889? Or email martin@martinhorwood.net. Ta.
@JelfAwards My pleasure. A really good initiative.
OK, local knowledge needed: who was Ron Smith, after whom the sports pavilion in Springbank is named?
Civic Award congratulations to @CllrRowenaHay Jane Lillystone & Nick Sinden of @bgsarchitects for @TheWilsonChelt http://t.co/wANevVHcmg
@Alexwintermute I'll certainly try. Not entirely in my power but I'll certainly lobby for it ti be protected.
At Civic Awards for great new local buildings & design. Really inspiring but may have to be renamed Richard Stanley awards though!
@TheLivingRoom12 Thanks!
@JamesKurtt Not sure which letter - I send lots!
@BadgerGoalie Met Police commissioner today and raised the issue actually. Hot tip though: insults don't normally improve customer care.
@JelfAwards My pleasure. Important to celebrate best practice!
@AwesomeRealAle I hope so! I guess that's up to the owner of the house.

Fantastic #Banksy art (we think!) a few yards from my office! In great tradition of political protest art. http://t.co/irnDtoHChL
@Chelt52 Thanks and good luck for your week. So much I didn't find time to tweet about so looking forward to yours!
@JonathanSindall Not yet. Hope local taggers leave it alone..
@JohnyMoz Well Pittville Park pretty good but I agree most are nowhere near that standard. Fancy a campaign?
@kellegram @markboston_uk I hope not. Banksy or not, it's a great piece of work.
@thesweetcheat @qikipedia How true. Join the Dark Skies campaign now! @cfds_uk    http://t.co/erug3TmyFI
@PeterJFielding Well one anyway. One day we'll hang on to one if those leads..
@HilaryComms @atkinsradio @bbcglos It was great fun. You chat to Richard as if you've just gone for a coffee - perhaps a bit dangerous!
@PrueBray That's true isn't it? Hadn't thought of it like that..
@WellChild Good luck to all your runners!
I'm not sure mine can.. RT @qikipedia: The human eye can see a candle flame in the dark thirty miles away.
Small domestic developing over #AmazingGreys. One small person wants to watch it. Looks like excruciating rubbish to the grown-ups..
Good luck. Should be be OK as we have Robins' traditional, er, away advantage! RT @PeterJFielding: Here we go #CTFC http://t.co/1VA9KPSZge
@stitch_this We could have some spa water wiggles on a Cheltenham flag. Salubritas et eruditio and all that!
Mystery solved! RT @jonnymstorey: @MartinChelt http://t.co/r7WxwRD3Av
@AbBrightman @jamesinoxford Not sure origin of the cross was exactly Nordic. Chap in Palestine I think. Nordics into Odin at the time..
@yostanty @Chelt52 No significant impact year-on-year. Important to crack down on abuse of ZHCs but no doubt economy getting stronger.
@ComingUpTheHill Because there's no suggestion she's broken the law.
Odd thing about Miller case is why old MP committee was resurrected to judge. Why not pass even old cases to new independent IPSA?  #bbcqt
This is Gloucestershire's Severn Cross, adopted 2008. So flags for UN, Europe, UK, England & Glos but not Chelt. Hm. http://t.co/JT8NRqP35N

@cheltandy @jrmaidment Although LGS application all for Cheltenham borough but true in NW and Tewks cd argue we weren't co-operating.
@jbbsec @julianhuppert Actually I wd never have fired anyone in business for mistake & repayment not dishonesty. Attitude the real problem.
Stuck in Parlt on 3line whip, trying to follow #JCS debate on Twitter. Good reports by @jrmaidment, bit confused by Jesus C Superstar tweets
Former MP of the day: 1. Craven Berkeley, a lively character. #duel #horsewhip #infidel #riot #bribery http://t.co/0R9LAZ0iFX
PM says you shouldn't fire people at first sign of trouble. Just as well #LibDems stopped their fire-at-will plan for everyone else then.
Just congratulated #LibDem minister @lfeatherstone on coalition govt meeting target of 0.7% of UK income to help world's poor #fairerworld
Tory-led Glos Local Transport Body votes to split £3.3m they'd prioritised for Cheltenham Spa station with two other projects. Real blow.
@thejuppster Actually I think councillors of all parties do. PS if you retrace tweet exchange you'll find you mentioned @cheltlibdems first!
@sa_cullen @lordbonkers @BBCNews Not at all. Parallels extremely worrying. Important Europe has credible & effective sanctions ready.
@luanwise Hmm. Call my office on 224889 and we'll try to find out for you, unless @wendyflynn knows?
@DanielBaker_eu @jap64 @BBCGlos @nick_clegg I guess salad acceptable! Hot less crucial than healthy but not 100% sure my Sam wd go for it..
@RobJHopkins @Chelt52 It's a bit more pressure than regular tweeting but I'm getting into it! Hope you enjoy it too.
This week only I'm also tweeting as @Chelt52. Pls follow - it's a great project & you find out about stuff like... http://t.co/6ycJcY1JoP
Good debate with @lisanandy & minister @JennyWillott stressing need for more corp transparency, incl human & environm supply chain impact
Just on @BBCGlos to plug @nick_clegg plan for free hot healthy lunches for all primary kids. Has exposed some poor Glos kitchen provision
Now in H of Commons: more on Miller expenses row & implications for new MPs expenses setup. #gladIneverthoughtofclaimingmortgageonexpenses
@thejuppster Councillors of Tewkesbury & Gloucester do apparently. It's not really politicising to point that out.
@thejuppster Trouble is every time @CheltLibDems vote to protect green spaces Tory-run Tewkesbury & Gloucester veto it.
@thejuppster I have done.
@mattwecho Hi Matt. Not via Twitter - always call my office if poss. Thanks
V worrying. @BBCNews report Donetsk 'people's republic' declared. Black shirts & salutes particularly spinechilling. http://t.co/3s5U1muwRh

@B_Carlton I agree. Connecting two halves of High St. will help Lr High St. Full of unique independents; should be our Camden.

@phillippa92 @RSPCA_official I'm sure I'll be sympathetic but need a wee bit more detail. Call 224889 to fix a time to meet?
@B_Carlton Yes, good thought. PS If you're at LSE you should drop into Parliament one day.
@AuroraHorwood Can I congratulate you on your interest in politics & surname - I found you searching on our family net domain: AroraHorwood!
@acet2001 Trust me, I am! It's nasty and self-defeating.
@GillLouis Which school was that? Still visit schools as much as I can.
@carolynquinncq Thanks for time on @BBCWestminHour tonight. Perhaps a bit too candid at one point - sorry about that!
@GillLouis Or within current PSHE approach but more specific? Some school students know v little though many locally keen & engaged.
@FGW Hmm. Seems to happen every year though.. but thanks for the feedback
@FrasersFudj Fantastic! Give me a ring on 224889 and let's see if we can get some to the House of Commons!
@ChrisRev7 Yes I am. Feel free to email or send message via http://t.co/VdTm4ayilo. Most foreign policy issues don't fit 140 characters.

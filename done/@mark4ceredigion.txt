@Bailey83M Welsh Government responsible for storm damage repair funds. Despite pressure they decided not to apply for more.
@Vaughan_Wms but, the Welsh Gov will have automatically received Barnett consequentials for any funds spent in England on storm damage.

@Simplicitly I voted for a recent PMB which sought to scrap it. I am proud of my record on this issue, and have made my opposition clear.
@Simplicitly And I have repeatedly spoken against the bedroom tax in Parliament numerous times - as recently as earlier this month.
@Simplicitly I've signed a critical Welsh Affairs Select Committee report into the issue published earlier this year.
@Simplicitly I have continued to speak out against it and support attempts to remove it.
@Simplicitly Every time I have had the opportunity to directly scrap or reduce the harm caused by the bedroom tax, I have voted to do so.
@Simplicitly I voted for this amendment, rebelling against the Government on this issue - it sadly did not pass.
@Simplicitly with an amendment to Welfare Reform Bill which would have stopped it being applied when there was no alternative accommodation.
@Simplicitly Rob, The key vote on the bedroom tax was on the 1st of February 2012.

@Simplicitly The text of the motion is here: http://t.co/nV7jRAwlWN
@Simplicitly The reason my vote on 12 Feb 2014 was with the majority is because the majority voted to repeal the bedroom tax.
@StarChildAlpaca @alecaberystwyth @WelshLibDems Alec tells me he replied in the early hours of this morning Bryan!
@Simplicitly @CarersTrust I have consistently refused to support the Government’s policy on this specific matter.

@Vipont55 and leaving the EU would be catastrophic for Welsh farmers. CAP payments are a lifeline for many.
@Vipont55 which is what Norway does - and they get no say over EU regulations, yet have to implement them all to maintain it.
@Vipont55 the only way to get better terms is to stay in Europe and work with others for reform.

@JohnVWilliams @nick_clegg if you're watching then you already know the answer to that.

We cannot underestimate how important financial support from the EU is for our farming communities in rural Wales. #whyIamIN #NickvsNigel
Sadly he didn't commit an

I asked the Secretary of State at this mornings Wales Office questions whether he would be support Nick or Nigel this evening. #NickvsNigel

Delighted that the Wales Bill has been published.  Today is a proud day to be a Welsh Liberal Democrat.
.@walesoffice: #WalesBill to enable @WelshGovernment to raise more of its own money #Budget2014
@Callum_Ed the employment allowance will let companies create new jobs for young people & our £800 tax cut will mean more in their pockets.

@suzzibuzz thanks Suzy!
@Goleudy thanks Kez!
@mariemcg66 thanks Marie!
Very sad to hear that Tony Benn has died. A great man & a superb orator.
@Paul_in_Aber sometimes they make the politburo look transparent. They need better oversight, definitely.
@mariemcg66 thanks Marie!
Celyn from Cardigan, Dewi and Jaeger are excellent ambassadors for our county.  Congratulations on their efforts!
Excellent afternoon visit to the Big Bang UK fair in Birmingham to celebrate the achievements of Ceredigion students.
@acceredigion thank you!
@StarChildAlpaca thanks Bryan!
@daijones19 thanks Dai!
@matusound thank you!
@RogatTwit thanks Roger!
@RMarggrafTurley @Dylan_Lewis I could not agree more. Ceredigion needs and deserves better.
@libkarl my position is conditional on a better law coming in to replace it, because the Hunting Act is a very narrow piece of legislation.
@5naini I'm making urgent representations to Hywel Dda to make clear that these plans are utterly unacceptable.
@Dylan_Lewis as per usual. Yet more salami slice cuts.
Any further reduction of services in Bronglais is unacceptable. Please sign my peitition opposing a downgrade: http://t.co/LejoBT3WXW
I will be seeking clarification and reassurance from Hywel Dda Health Board particularly in regard to Bronglais.
I am very worried by the Royal College of Physicians Report into cardiac care which has called for a specialist "hub" in Carmarthen.
@wellyboots1 that's down to the English curriculum - your best bet would be to get in touch with your local MP and lobby him about this.
@RhianLlewelyn @WelshLibDems all Welsh Lib Dem MPs voted against the rise in Tuition Fees Rhian.
Young people are disproportionately impacted by increases in public transport fares. @WelshLibDems would introduce a #FairerFares scheme.
Great to meet with the those behind 4CG Cymru who've won a National award for the fantastic work they do in Cardigan. http://t.co/uiNIXfshOT
Fantastic lunch with @FUWpress in the House of Lords today. http://t.co/ztjx3bYz9H
I've written to @AlunDaviesAM to ask him to support Ceredigion's farmers, fishermen & businesses as they recover from the recent storms.
@YsgolGAberporth it was lovely to be able to visit! Thank you for having me!
The sun is out and Aberporth looks fantastic. It's nice to get a break from the rain! http://t.co/yvgfALYuKW
@james_gethin a cuppa would be nice some day soon - just a flying visit to Aberporth School today I'm afraid.
Busy surgery in Aberystwyth this morning & now I'm headed down to visit Aberporth School and visit a few constituents about casework.
I know the nurses Kirsty & I spoke with in Tregaron on Saturday were supportive of the Bill, I hope all AMs present today can support it.
My colleague @Kirsty_Williams PMB has a bill before the Senedd which calls for more nurses in Wales.
I was pleased to visit the fantastic Coed y Bont, run by Pontrhydfendigaid Community

@heavenlyskin okay. I'll check we recieved it - could you also resend it to http://t.co/ZZcaw30yeO@parliament.uk? Sorry again!
@heavenlyskin I'm sorry to hear that! That's far too long to wait. Which email address did you send it to?
Fantastic evening in yesterday @ytalbot with @CeredigionLD @mark4ceredigion @Kirsty_Williams @ElunedParrottAM @RogerWilliamsMP
Now headed back to Aber to visit the Gas Gallery, pick up my wife and then I'm back down to Tregaron for the Lib Dem St David's Day Dinner!
Fantastic day knocking on doors in Tregaron with a superb team and my party leader @Kirsty_Williams #winninghere http://t.co/cs04ZE70eU
Great day so far of door knocking. We've knocked on every door in Tregaron.
Taking a short break in Cafe Hafan in Tregaron with @Kirsty_Williams @CllrEvans @alecaberystwyth & @AberUniLibDems http://t.co/3X8rVGRmrR
And then tonight is much anticipated our St David's Day Dinner in @ytalbot hotel, Tregaron. http://t.co/QUoxioFQdp
Then I'm up to Tregaron for some door knocking with @Kirsty_Williams @CllrEvans @alecaberystwyth and a contingent from @AberUniLibDems
Busy day in the constituency today, I'm headed for a coffee morning with @WelshMarkCole in Cardigan.
This extra money raises the total investment in broadband in Wales by Westminster to £69 million since 2010.
I'm really pleased that the Westminster Government has announced an extra £12 million to help speed up the roll-out of broadband in Wales.
@welshnotbritish indeed. It definitely seems to be the same person (or persons) doing it.
@CymruYfory I was very glad to host the debate. Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help :)
Hosted excellent meeting in the HoC today talking about reserved powers with @CymruYfory . Hope the cross party consensus on this will hold.
@JonathanPlaid @mikeparkerwales sadly this wasn't actually a vote to abolish the bedroom tax - that was on February the 12th.
Had a good working lunch with Elystan Morgan today - good conversation about the threat to Bronglais and how we will work together.
Have met with constituent's in Parliament today as part of the @bully_banks lobby http://t.co/jGJFKXhMa2
@KeepMePostedUK @PrincipalityBS very pleased indeed. Da iawn Principality!

@ytalbot @thetimes I'm looking forward to it too! It promises to be a fantastic evening!
.@ytalbot congratulations on making @TheTimes top 50 B&Bs inUK. Another fantastic #Ceredigion business getting the recognition they deserve!
@danslitfrippery nonetheless it's my job to represent everyone even if you didn't vote for me please do tweet me if I can ever be of help :)
@danslitfrippery it does say you're in Aberystwyth on your twitter profile Daniel? That's a fairly good indicator.
@danslitfrippery last time that was the Tories (plus the number of MPs didn't work with Labour) but it might not be next time.
@danslitfrippery that would all, of course depend on who offered the best deal. 2/3
@danslitfrippery because in the event of another hung parliament we might well need to work with them. 1/2
@danslitfrippery I try to make a point of following people who live in Ceredigion to help me keep in touch with my constituents :)
On Saturday, I'll be hosting a St David's Day Dinner at @ytalbot get your tickets here: http://t.co/6kMJrhW9j3 http://t.co/3zZSJjAO1L
@heavenlyskin I usually try to respond  within 48 hours, although since I receive hundreds of emails a day this isn't always possible.
@thomasscarrott happy to support it! It's a very worthwhile campaign that would deliver a huge economic boost to Ceredigion.

@spasm1965 thanks Rob! Always nice to hear!
@eddsirr but extra English spending should result in extra resources for Wales which the Welsh Assembly will determine how to spend. 2/2
@eddsirr no - not directly, because flood management is devolved. 1/2
If you're in Ceredigion today, please stay inside and stay safe. #aberystwyth #aberstorm

@tonywales396 @acceredigion they had better Tony, 11,042 signatures is a huge number of people.
This petition is a huge Illustration of the  anger at Hywel Dda's plans. They must take notice of it. #SaveOurServices
Today, I joined the Friends of Cardigan Hospital & Town Council presenting an 11k strong petition to Welsh Assembly. #SaveOurServices
I'm visiting Sainsbury's in Lampeter before my surgery to support their active kids initiative. http://t.co/r8SaJNeM0P
@thomasscarrott I know many parents will be in the same situation - Hywel Dda haven't been very clear on what this will mean for patients.
If you haven't signed my petition yet, please do & oppose this & any future downgrade of Bronglais http://t.co/lpXeyvgOdn #SaveOurServices
@LauraDickens90 no, just that the unit will be midwife, rather than consultant led. Salami slice approach to cuts as usual.
@electoralreform  I voted for the Lords changes to the bill. More work is required on the lobbying bill from the Government.

@Shan__Rees Hi Shan, I voted for the Lords changes to the bill. More work is required on the lobbying bill from the Government.
The idea that not enough babies born in Ceredigion justifies lack of a consultant led service in Bronglais is just wrong. #SaveOurServices
The midwifery service, more than any should not involve vast travelling distance for a consultant led service. #SaveOurServices
Appalling news that  the Hwyel Dda Board is downgrading the midwifery service at Bronglais. #SaveOurServices
@Paul_in_Aber I agree with your sentiments, but these are cuts in England. We need to clarify the Natural Resources
Wales dimension.
@Paul_in_Aber Hi Paul, sorry for the slow reply, I had to look into this one! 1/2
They've been on holiday, but they're back tomorrow so I wait eagerly.
Very disappointed by the Secretary of State's comments. The onus is now on the Assembly.
Just visited Llanddewi Brefi school and met with the local Councillor & the Governors it's a lovely, vibrant village school.
Lovely early morning drive to Llanddewi Brefi before catching the train to London. Ceredigion really does have some spectacular scenery.

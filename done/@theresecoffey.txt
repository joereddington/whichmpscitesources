@theresecoffey
@Bottbooks are you getting ready for #smallbusinessSaturday
@MichaelLCrick list goes on... Tulip Siddiq? Lara Norris...guardian did article on this
@MichaelLCrick Polly Billington? Lucy Powell? Jessica Assato? Julia Goldworthy?
@Feline_Gardener yup. Have to be properly briefed esp with experienced interviewer like MM
Popped into Colneis Rd Primary School to see progress of children on Magna Carta flags. Some creative ideas. Well done Mr Loxley & children
Car crash of an interview on @BBCSuffolk by Jane Basham now
@AdrianRawlinson or they can give it back to govt
@ianjfitch the NHS is treating more people than ever before. Nothing to fear but proposed cuts by Labour locally
@Xqusei no. I don't want Labour plan to cut funds for NHS in Suffolk or stop local GPs making decisions on healthcare
@ianjfitch it won't make progress beyond today.
No convention at all on by elections stopping 6 months out. Farage wrong on @BBCr4today
@ianjfitch you should ask Labour why they lobbied for nhs funding cuts to suffolk.  Check Andy Burnham letter to NHS Board in Dec 13
@ianjfitch & I'm proud that we brought in more rigorous CQC inspection of NHS as that's good for patients. Improvements still needed
@ianjfitch I am also proud local GPs  making decisions on health care decisions for Suffolk patients - which Efford bill wants to stop
@ianjfitch I'm in Suffolk today. I'm proud of our record on NHS for patients, more £ nationally, more £ locally & pressing for more
Welcome to Rev Seeley,  new Bishop of Ipswich and St Edmundsbury
@ianjfitch no I won't be
Thoroughly enjoyed @SCTories Annual Dinner held jointly with @ben4ipswich & Ipswich Conservatives. Tour de force speech from IDS.
Energy efficiency in rural homes increases by almost 3000% in six months https://t.co/t2kx94cHaq
@ClareReads cheers C
@StuartLong01 both
"Dawn drop" finally done. Now enjoying nice cup of tea in Morris ons.  It's very popular
@LapwingEd ask a sponsor? Suffolk Foundation?
@BrandonLewis thanks!
@DJack_Journo thank you very much
Pre birthday treat. Lunch at Joe Allen. Lion King at Lyceum. Happy Sunday!
Good to hear that @farlingayehigh has received £500 from @FootballFoundtn towards buying new goals for younger players
@KEdge23 @RobertWinfield2 @KellyTolhurst good reaction
@FraserNelson @JustinWelby I'm not CoE but as objective observer would be keen to understand criteria to meet "one of the greatest"
Back from Rochester. Great team spirit backing @KellyTolhurst
@cjball_london we've had a good day but I pity you to have so much hatred in your life. I'll leave you to it. Bye.
@Felixseasiders @NewmarketTownFC there is only so much excitement I can handle in one day!

@EllieeGavin I hope the debating society gets off the ground.
Pleasure to hear @claire4devizes , @ben4ipswich, Passenger Focus + @NewAngliaLEP Mark Pendlington at Suffolk Rail conference
@AlisonSwaddle congratulations Councillor
@JWoodcockMP would be happy to speak in Parliament. Been trying for some time to get NHS England moving on it
@JWoodcockMP @BBC_Cumbria ditto for Ipswich + rural Suffolk. Not denying issue but not unique. Parts of NW, NE & London largely over funded
@JWoodcockMP @BBC_Cumbria to clarify the unique situation? Most Suffolk patients get considerably less per head than Cumbria patients
Looking forward to seeing @claire4devizes at Suffolk Rail conference tomorrow.  I hope the train gets her here on time
@Nigel_Pickover congratulations NP
Very pleased to be guest speaker at Y11 leavers' presentation evening at @aldevalley School. Well done to students, parents & staff alike
Really interesting visit to @worldlandtrust in Halesworth; met @JohnABurton, Vivien & team http://t.co/xRIPK9r1Dh http://t.co/dm3Dk2FO7E
Nice to meet @FXA_Academy students in Parliament Week, including @MMeredithDMYP who will be in Parliament tomorrow http://t.co/XmI2PXlspw
@gabyhinsliff It looked gratuitously unpleasant in first two minutes
@JDO4 @aldevalley it was a very enjoyable  evening
@Welshracer hahaha

From @Spectator_CH ... A picture paints a thousand words http://t.co/1D1EIzX87E
@StuartLong01 I pray so
@lochossian @suffolkwildlife already done that thanks
Education main theme today - starting at @FXA_Academy, ending at @aldevalley, with new Sole Bay Health Centre & @worldlandtrust in between
Met Felixstowe Ferry fishermen to discuss issues on fishing ground disruption and closing of fisheries. Good session to end a busy day
Suffolk Coast Delivery Energy Board meeting made some good progress. Quite a few actions for me out of it!
Useful chat with Angela Gant CEO of http://t.co/W4gvZQEP5T updating me on STEM projects, who I first met through @suffolkchamber
Thanks to Provost Richard Lister for a good discussion about UCS Suffolk @UCS_NEWS . Bright future for Ipswich & all of Suffolk
@Teresapotts1 but just like your own time line shows, all of us have a bit of leisure time and fun. Enjoy your day
@Teresapotts1 whereabouts Teresa? You may want to email me? It so happens I met fishermen this week.
Thanks to the team @AngliaHub for a briefing on how they are supporting local businesses. http://t.co/Hp0b0Rpfxx http://t.co/DeRFavAVHe
@Teresapotts1 really? Why's that?
Busy fun day but why didn't anyone tell me Grey's Anatomy was back on? Downloads galore
@MMeredithDMYP you merited it
@toryboypierce think you will find Govt won all the votes today. Shambles was Labour collapsing debate and faux outrage
@StigAbell bizarre that Labour voted to collapse the debate. They knew they wouldn't win their motion
@chuzzlit @Amanda_Vickery loads. Which party?
@CBItweets company cash flow will have improved on like for like basis with CT cut
@CBItweets out of interest, how many CBI members have used Corp tax cuts to increase staff wages or offer childcare?
A special day particularly to remember the Great War, coinciding with 25th anniversary of Berlin Wall collapse hastening end of Cold War
@m76_linda very special
"@waitrose: new #Christmas TV ad. When you own something you care a little bit more. https://t.co/eJJBe7FtkM" 47 secs in...brilliant!
Still many people trying to see poppies at the Tower, the Big Eye is all red and Big Ben now displaying poppy animation #wewillrememberthem
Thanks to folk of all ages from Saxmundham & Kelsale for their joint Act of Remembrance. The Leiston RBL band was splendid too #lestweforget
Thanks to the many attending Felixstowe Act of Remembrance. Veterans & cadets were on parade. Privileged to join you #wewillrememberthem

@alandavies1 funny show tonight. Heading back to Saxmundham
Congratulations to Victoria Prentis, next Conservative MP for Banbury @NorthOxonTories
@NicPandolfi it's quite fun but I'm not aware of apathy along our coast
@Keithisatwit @victorshannock that's very kind
@NicPandolfi catch up Nic,  already RT'd it yesterday
@ErikaSpallMYP hi. Are you en route?
@DPJHodges though of course Labour gave up part of the EU rebate during their 13 years
@FraserNelson @AnneJolis but he has got the bill halved and delayed. A week ago the EC was insisting on 1.7bn on Dec 1st
@MichaelLCrick 5 months 2 weeks then but 7th May key day
The General Election is 6 months away.
@Policy_Exchange what about other regional trains eg Ipswich to Cambridge
@AAshby14 if I'm your MP email me please
@MrRBourne I don't think it's beyond their wits to have a recharging policy
@MrRBourne the 4G licence good example of extending coverage but if you hadn't noticed we don't have great coverage. EE best in my area
@liveotherwise email me more of your reasoning
@MrRBourne not exactly trigger happy. I remember discussing this with operators 3 years ago
@MrRBourne championing consumers
@Geates @EADT24 Jo will be great.
Congratulations to @Jochurchill4 next MP for Bury St Edmunds. It will be a great pleasure to work with her for Suffolk
Pleased to support @NewAngliaLEP cultural reception in Parliament
Hearing from Sir Alan Massey, CEO of the Maritime & Coastguard Agency, updating us on the smooth transition of the coastguard network.

Great to see group of students from @farlingayehigh in Parliament today, organised by Mr Fitch http://t.co/50nm6ANyba
Very pleased that Leiston Primary School is finally an academy, as part of the Avocet Multi Academy Trust. Well done to all involved
Get this... https://t.co/YruwIhGcjh ... very interesting to see how YOUR tax is spent. #whathaveyoudonetodaytomakeyoufeelproud
At long last @UCS_NEWS is going to offer a paramedic BSc. I asked them to look into this a few years ago. They said no. Glad it's now a yes.
@orfordness7 thanks I think!
@JoshuaRozenberg @JackofKent but the latter keep being referred up, eventually to President of Family Court is key question for me
@JoshuaRozenberg @JackofKent the different lawyers appears solely to be on the grounds that dad is protected person due to learning capacity
@JoshuaRozenberg @JackofKent if both parents want D back & are togther opposing adoption, why are they required to have different lawyers?
@JoshuaRozenberg @JackofKent read carefully. Help me understand why case is now on its 4th judge? No judge so far has returned D to parents
@wallaceme each of us can make sure we are
@danielrhamilton I don't know actually Dan, just heard AWS news
@Samfr thank heavens for Conservative Ministers upgrading ICT and & STEM, bringing back key skills and rigour to help secure stronger future
@wallaceme disagree. We are out to win on record of delivery of growth, jobs and stating to balance the books and offering future security
@lindarella Try Heveningham next year
@lindarella true. Where we you for fireworks?
Good for half term tourism trade to have such nice weather last week. Sad to see them disappear down A12. See you all again soon
@afroswede at least Mr Pye will know it is safe
@teresaholm1 If you are referring to press article, I think you will find no such thing has happened
Another natural AWS in a Conservative retirement seat... well done Banbury
@Independent not exactly. A civil servant proposed an idea which was promptly squashed
@ayestotheright in Miliband's logic, is Scotland currently over represented too?
@BBCSuffolk it's this Govt introducing coding for primary school children and has upgraded ICT gcse exam bringing back programming
Back out on campaign trail for @ben4ipswich . Great local MP with record of delivery and huge vision for Ipswich & Suffolk

@unitedresponse sorry in Bill Committee

Delighted to support Pigs, Poultry and Eggs reception in Parliament tonight with Georgina and Zoe from BPA http://t.co/Xp7hfwB6QE
@GuidoFawkes hey. I didn't know you ventured out of Westminster and ROI
@joecassels my pleasure but my vote was not connected to the 38 degree campaign
Good trip to Rochester today with @ChloeSmithMP
@Adrian_Hilton I think that's rather insulting to those that serve on it and decries role of lay members. A vote was had. End of.
@Adrian_Hilton what's secret about it? Full debate in Parliament. Lay members on the committee who express opinion on MPs' deliberations
@Adrian_Hilton this is a big change. Many MPs, understandably, consider General Election to be the regular recall
@Adrian_Hilton @ZacGoldsmith this is where I disagree with Zac as I think it is...
Been mega-busy but I voted for the @ZacGoldsmith amendment for Recall. Many good reasons pro/con. We lost but a form of recall is def coming
Pleasure to speak to @BBCSuffolk just now on coastal communities report from ONS http://t.co/uvwTFkhslz
@BradleyWalsh @Line_of_duty @Misskeeleyhawes #teamdenton roll on the Baftas
@andrewpolitics well they know who to blame I hope
Out celebrating the 40th Birthday of @NigelMillsMP with @sheryllmurray , @chhcalling and other happy souls
@drwollastonmp I was in same lobby as you Sarah but let's not deny that a form of recall has been voted for. Better than nowt
@drwollastonmp to be fair, what's changed is that a form of recall will now be in place between elections
@CarolineLucas @ZacGoldsmith but that is democracy
@mar_gar_ine haha. Hi Mark .hope all well
@NewsAnnabelle @Geates @NewAngliaLEP @ben4ipswich I recall someone else from the LEP wondering why we don't refer to new Massachusetts
@MarieClaudeCECA good stuff
Computer off? Tick. Telephone off hook/silent? Tick. Glass of wine?  Tick. TV switched to C4? Tick. Sit back and enjoy #Homeland
@MatthewLinley @easternangles agree
@emmafreud for 300 bucks? Blimey
@bornatthepaget I like your twitter handle. I hope all proud new parents are tweeting you lovely pictures
@anitathetweeter @TomMcTague letter of the year I think (or was it an email)
@tgb_uk24 good point
I may start campaign for turning back clock day to be #parentsday so kids realise the extra hour is a lie-in for their amazing mums & dads
Good to see @MarkPNewAnglia of @NewAngliaLEP giving evidence tomorrow. I'm sure he'll be asking for HS4 for East Anglia
@BTCare it's done now but took 4 people to sort it
@BTCare I'm trying to cancel it but as I have 2 accounts - one for phone and one for broadband, that was difficult apparently
Finally getting somewhere... though charge of £30 to disconnect broadband...
I've been dreading making this phone call, it seems with good reason. Now on to my 4th person @BTCare trying to cancel my phone & broadband.
Looking forward to campaigning for @ben4ipswich with @SCTories today. Join us at 10am at Benacre Rd & help us keep a great MP
Home at dusk. Perfect time to water the garden  (flower beds still going well)

Looking forward to campaigning this weekend in Rochester & Strood for @KellyTolhurst
Pleasure to join BHF for CPR training. Any school or community can get kit for free. Companies to pay. http://t.co/H48qSulbr4
@StuartMaggs whose failings? I am referring to NHS England
@lesleydolphin @WarHorseOnStage @Taff_Gillingham take some tissues Lesley but it is fabulous
NHS England also needs to uphold their legal duty of reducing inequality on access to services. No signs NHS doing that at all
Let's hope the NHS CEO also understands we need fairer funding formula across England, for primary & secondary health
@WalberswickBell sorry to hear you got caught again but I'm sure your customers will be back tomorrow
Very pleasant evening @GuidoFawkes 10th anniversary dinner. Much jollity mixed with anxiety on golden x - hairs.  Maude worthy winner

@andrewpolitics I'm not surprised. Old regime reduced training time to keep more ECAs on road but led to chronic shortage of paramedics
@andrewpolitics sickness rate has fallen (though still higher than average) but time spent training paramedics has increased
@andrewpolitics at one point, EEAST sickness rate was so high they spent £1M per month on sick pay & another £1M on private ambulance cover
@andrewpolitics what year was that Andrew?
@montie @timmontgomerie is this austerity or actually character building?
@ayestotheright @PhilipDaviesMP Labour decided not to move amendment that Philip would have supported so karma restored : )

@FraserNelson I think Barroso tried to rule out budget freeze too
@janemerrick23 so in manifesto, what does it say about wrongdoing?
@janemerrick23 There are plenty of MPs in same situation. Take a walk down Upper Committee corridors and see. I have 2 windows but in NSN
@janemerrick23 @ZacGoldsmith remember Zac also says it is Nick Clegg ' s Bill
@janemerrick23 Zac? frozen out? onw aht basis? btw have you read manifestos?
@PickardJE @MissusVee @amolrajan not necessarily true. OAPs tend to have fixed income and no (differential) earnings potential

@NickBolesMP anyone who has read your book "Which Way's Up" won't be surprised at your thoughts on EU migration
Our govt has put real increase £ into NHS. Labour said it was irresponsible. Welsh Labour cut NHS £. Labour wants to cut NHS £ in Suffolk.

@stephenkb and my parents were both teachers in the state system

@Roystoncanary no idea . Best to contact Sue Allen or Michael Ladd
@randolphreydon @vicarrich I'll follow up. Is it all of Reydon?
@Roystoncanary haha. Waste of an egg

@Roystoncanary yes Roy. Sad but there we go

@FionaODonnellMP as you know I was out in your area, though just for an evening
@FionaODonnellMP of course. There's no question of not passing it. Bigger Q is agreement on what gets devolved cf Smith commission
@DavidChandler00 we'll see
@UKBest4Scotland @FionaODonnellMP no need for it too. SP, WA & NIA  work on "coalition" basis. So can English laws in WM
@Andym6769 please clarify
@FionaODonnellMP @Margaret_Curran where UK is transferring powers to devolved areas needs UK agreement
@FionaODonnellMP @Margaret_Curran so what is wrong with that? Or the laws that only affect England and Wales being voted on by Eng/Welsh MPs
@Dr_Teacake @holysmoke I don't understand but thanks to DT for precis
I took my hols in Scotland & campaigned for the Union. I did it for my country, not my party. I hope Scots Lab MPs "get it" & back Eng devo

@holysmoke good man
@gabyhinsliff well does it have a TPO? We need to know
@holysmoke can you summarise #Synod14 for us?
@FionaODonnellMP  You can't vote on laws affecting your own constituents on devolved matters. So why vote in those areas for English people?

Tour over and good visit to Flagship Leiston Foyer. Now to Felixstowe for surgery, then onto Con Club for farewell to Club Secretary
@AllieRenison @drwollastonmp I think our first open primary was in Warrington
http://t.co/aJiOLkBCz1 Happy to support Sir Bobby auction
@drwollastonmp if you can point to an open primary held by our party that wasn't genuinely open, I would like to know
@drwollastonmp Conservatives have had open primaries selecting candidates for 2005 and 2010 GE. No other party has done that
@drwollastonmp low turnouts. E selection limits the selection pool and we have council elections every 4 years
@drwollastonmp tbh I think they were much harder work and costly for the candidates than the postal primaries we held for Totnes & Gosport
@drwollastonmp I have participated in two  open primaries. They were certainly open to all and I tried to drum up support.
@drwollastonmp true though you will know the financial cost for the Party to do that

@ianjfitch an obvious one is whole life tariff sentencing or prisoner votes. On both they wanted modification
@kingbagcarrier @ZacGoldsmith check Hansard.  I think you will find more Conservative MPs voted for it than LDs. Bye now
@kingbagcarrier @ZacGoldsmith astonishing you fall for LD propaganda then
@kingbagcarrier @ZacGoldsmith simply not true Stephen but I bet you're a LD activist brainwashed into this
@ZacGoldsmith sadly that is the case and you experience that more than most #reelectZacGoldsmith
It comes to something when a LD MP seemingly prefers to showcase their photo with David Cameron rather than Nick Clegg
Odd M Bruce talking of corrupt electoral system when British public voted for FPTP meanwhile LDs voted against equal sized constituencies
Flipside 2014 at Snape Maltings, Woodbridge Shuck Festival by Tide Mill but I'm heading to Bucklesham Plough Day
Very good reaction in Felixstowe this morning on increasing tax threshold to £12500 and to return sovereignty on human rights to the UK
Treated @FraserMcFarland to his first ever oyster. Loads on at the festival tomorrow http://t.co/gAMCAN1zzF
Eternal rest grant unto him O Lord. Let perpetual light shine upon him. May he rest in peace RIP Alan Henning
@paulwaugh it's a fave of many MPs
@Monty_Bont @SimpersoSuffolk well they're very tasty. Come visit us tomorrow or Sunday
#ff @SimpersoSuffolk - delicious oysters today. Woodbridge Shuck festival tomorrow
@photofletch @Geates good point
@juliagurney whereabouts?
@IsabelOakeshott @SkyAnushka it's what hoovers are for
@Geates they don't
@paulwaugh so what? (Or fave is ...so what you're really saying is ...)
@PlaceFarm @martincampbell2 I switched network deliberately. Lots more broadband than 2 years ago
@rebelrouser29 @Geates oh and Aldeburgh
@rebelrouser29 @Geates EE shows 3G in Leiston on its map
Excited some interest on mobile phone coverage. Fwiw I chose @EE because of their coverage and ambitious rollout plans
@jonneal_UK still got it inside.
Rather surprised but pleased I can get 4G in my constituency  (Martlesham Heath)
@DanHannanMEP as you said let's win election first and get DC as PM so we get the referendum secured
@DanHannanMEP I think you know one q holds me back but plenty of time >2015 to debate (broader based economy than Nor/CH + who sets rules)
Good to hear @DanHannanMEP at tonight's CPS annual lecture
@BethRigby @MarkReckless @tracey_crouch @LouiseMensch not nasty Beth, just pointing out rules
@MarkReckless @BethRigby @tracey_crouch only to conclude parliamentary functions, not to take on new casework - check IPSA scheme 8.5, 8.7
Very concerned that one local GP surgery is misleading its patients on funding. It doesn't help when already working on the issue
And how can man die better than facing fearful odds, for the ashes of his father's and the temples of his gods #NationalPoetryDay
Then out spoke Horatio, the Captain of the Gate, to every man upon this earth , death cometh soon or late
Thanks to Camelot for great celebration event of National Lottery
@IkenCanoe but thanks for making me aware of it and I will follow up with Sax Health to ask why they are scaremongering
@IkenCanoe I think the scaremongering is actually very unprofessional
@IkenCanoe I'm v concerned that they have done this. The Government isn't making such changes. only Sax Health GPs can decide to offer less
Well done @SuffolkPolice on making such a quick arrest in horrid rape case
Judging Tech Factor in Tech Central. 4 charities 1 winner. X factor 2013 star Hannah Barrett judging and will be performing too #cpc14
@DMcCaffreySKY QTWAIN
@gabyhinsliff answer will be the same otherwise you concede defeat before even started
@JGForsyth don't worry James. @DanHannanMEP is a man of his word
@GuidoFawkes ah
@GuidoFawkes thanks. Hadn't seen it yet
@LordAshcroft See you there
@georgeeaton non sequitur
@ShippersUnbound I like the personalised touch
@NewsAnnabelle @andrewpolitics never quiet on the coast. Fab @AldeburghFood feast at Snape Maltings
@jameschappers @JananGanesh meanwhile Lib Dems refused to back fellow govt minister and voted down boundary change despite getting AV ref
@jameschappers @JananGanesh that 2nd Reading had one of largest majorities in Parliament you may recall
@jameschappers you don't think Conservatives have?
@jameschappers @JananGanesh @ublibdems erm. ... on grounds that haven't left for another party?
@jameskirkup @election_data oi! There's only one constituency with the word Coastal in it and I'm Conservative top to bottom
@timpayton no we didn't actually. We said no top down but stated we would shift decision making bottom up to GP groups, which we did
@JohnOMillward31 quite
@DC_Cartwright @lisaocarroll that's what local hospitals need to start turning that around, not counsel of despair
@MichaelDuffell certainly GP leaders are concerned. Lab plan is hospital dream
GP leaders worried by Labour NHS plans; could lead to destruction of GP practices http://t.co/qPFKMg00i5
Labour proposing biggest ever reorganisation of NHS.  http://t.co/qPFKMg00i5
@lisaocarroll Ask the charities we are resourcing and the ministers involved
@lisaocarroll send to Duudridge or Swayne at FCO / DfID
@lisaocarroll https://t.co/LRwLi0Z0Zi
@lisaocarroll why is it easy to fix? There may be routes but not easy
Plenty on today, including "Show Me Leiston" at Victory Rd recreation ground and @AldeburghFood Festival starts
Yesterday, I voted to support airstrikes against ISIL (https://t.co/8oSUDkNpAI)
@BethRigby @patrickwintour not that UKIP will be in power
@BethRigby so UKIP is raising EU imposed tax
@wallaceme 2 of the towns mentioned aren't in Waveney constituency (they are in the council area)
Good news for budding workers for @edfesizewellc https://t.co/pxrqNQUUgW
Nice to be out in sunshine this morning at Woodbridge market and on the Thoroughfare. Good chance to stop and talk about issues
@annadoble me
@DavidAllenGreen Thanks. can a physical trader be stopped selling till illegal goods are dealt with? I guess manufacturers seek parity
@DavidAllenGreen if goods are illegal & someone is selling illegal stuff, why does stopping that lead to stopping selling of legal stuff?
h/t @politicshome NHS boss Simon Stevens reminds Burnham of Labour's 2006 stipulation there must be competition in provision of services
@faisalislam @grant_rob had to be Formby. I wonder which footballer?
@SydLloyd @elliethetorydog woof
@BeerFaerie @suffolkchamber mmmm
@BeerFaerie @suffolkchamber why wasn't I invited ? ; )
@LuckyAitkens African violet variety?
@gabyhinsliff I hope your dog doesn't read that!
@EastEnglandAmb thanks
@EastEnglandAmb what is the sickness rate now? and how does it compare to 1 yr / 2 yrs ago?
@SJacksonMP @IsabelHardman and even why he is only interested in an English health service, not the NHS
@emmafreud remove divert number
@MirrorCeleb @CarolineFlintMP looks like Prescott is mainly froth
@robindbrant ah yes. The guy who gave evidence in trial. Thanks
@robindbrant who was editor at the time?
@Clough95 that's mean
@Andrew__Kennedy no reason. Just passing time on a railway platform :)
@Clough95 no. Very well dressed
And no I'm not going to get a photo
Trying to work out if I'm sitting next to someone from Geordie Shore
@CrackerjackMarq @btbusinesscare mine has been fine. What's your postcode? You can email me
Great evening with Essex&Suffolk/Northumbrian Water. Thanks Ivan for describing League Cup drama
@Robbill123 fair point
@Bee_Wiles1 sadly just platitudes
@tnewtondunn not exactly top of mind for him then
NHS is treating more people than before. Not sure Labour should be running down hard working staff
I'm pleased to be joining Essex and Suffolk Water at their award ceremony. Lord Lieutenant presiding
@NewAngliaLEP @BizRoadshow where and when in Southwold?
@adamboultonSKY is he referring to NHS performance in Wales?
I assume none of the Welsh delegates are so happy about Labour run NHS
Glad to hear Ed commitment to carbon free nuclear. Why didn't he start any nuclear power stations when he was energy secretary?
@PXEducation @Samfr @Policy_Exchange that's a heck of a lot of schools for one person
@PXEducation @Samfr @Policy_Exchange so who is commissioning education on behalf of parents? And if you are getting rid of LA educ team who?
False anger from Labour Clacton candidate on ambulances who did nothing on it nor his fellow Labour councillor who was a director for years
@Samfr @Policy_Exchange not clear on how you keep statutory duty of LA regarding monitoring and standards if you completely spin out educn
@Geates @virginmedia ah
@tnewtondunn @steve_hawkes did he take pay cut at start of Parliament when Govt ministers did? Ministers also had pay cuts for last 2 years
Will Ed tackle the NHS problems in Wales run by a Labour govt which chose to cut NHS funding?
@JoeWatts_ but he won't address the NHS problems in Wales
@Geates @virginmedia EE took less than a day
Great. I seem to have wiped my contacts on both phone and on Outlook. Backup working I hope. Mmm
Encouraging news on EDF state aid review. Bodes well for Sizewell C
At POWERful women dinner discussing how to improve diversity in energy sector. Top insight for me:80% people in nuclear work in safety roles
@faisalislam but how much more stamp duty paid by buyer now than under Labour?
@JoemacfA Referendum is over. Farewell
Delighted to pick up my free @Adnams pint for helping in the Big Clean Up yesterday. Cheers!
Harriet Harman - but you are changing the basis on what MPs have been elected to do part way through the Parliament. Double dutch
@GiftedNutter @chrisshipitv yes in effect local rail provided by TfL and price setting (with I assume subsidy) on buses
@chrisshipitv yes, just remembered big power that is different is that he sets bus and tube prices. I assume councils could do that
@chrisshipitv I can't think of anything particularly though I could be wrong on the tube/metro. There are not many other places with metro
Let's remember it was Labour and Lib Dem who voted down equal-sized constituencies
Classic Labour under Miliband. Keep the quango and all the cost but just set policy centrally #marr
Mili already showing centralist tendencies but I bet he won't commit to scrapping Low Pay Commission #marr
@chrisshipitv odd. Isn't transport devolved at every upper council level?
Poor example by Mili using Labour's introduction of tuition fees in England and Wales as example of UK issue
Popped into Felixstowe & Walton Bowls Club for their open day (on tomorrow too). Thanks to the Reillys for tuition. http://t.co/fIMipM5wxy
Referendum engagement and turnout amazing as it will be at EU referendum, only guaranteed by Conservative majority #letbritaindecide
@IainDale @Donal_Blaney @StewartWood I'm not
@tomgreatrexmp @reporterboy @Labourpaul how many English and Welsh?
Night all. Feels good going to sleep with the Union intact
@politicalhackuk @greenbirmingham @lorddeben he chose to resist plans to merge centres. I'm not aware PA ever rejected Chief Con proposals
@lorddeben @politicalhackuk @greenbirmingham further incentives on reducing unemployment
@lorddeben @politicalhackuk @greenbirmingham Already keep increments bus rates by attracting new business. Put tax increases to popular vote
Congratulations @lorddeben by the way. Your new grandson looks delightful
@lorddeben I think that sums it up what PM said this morning and in our manifesto
@wallaceme @VictoriaPeckham yup. As @gareth_snell pointed out , they voted to retain and Stoke voted to drop
@politicalhackuk @greenbirmingham @lorddeben PCC certainly been a success in Suffolk
@politicalhackuk @greenbirmingham @lorddeben not a trick. Puts power in hands of the people. Higher council tax requires popular vote
@lorddeben that was in our manifesto but does not necessarily need separate English parliament
@gareth_snell interesting
@lorddeben what independence do you think they need?
@gerrylynch I agree
@VictoriaPeckham yes corrected my mistake. Risk of tweeting after late night
@gareth_snell meant to say Doncaster voted to keep a Mayor too ...lost train of thought
@gareth_snell my mistake
@MBRoberts4004 @lorddeben English weren't looking to leave union. SNP elected by landslide to Scots Parlt in 2011
@greenbirmingham @lorddeben Westminster already ceding powers via deregulation and local referenda on taxes, PCC and similar
@lorddeben I haven't had any call for a English Parliament from constituents, nor city regions
Oh yes , Doncaster voted against a Mayor too
2012 mayors were rejected in referendums in various cities. Only Bristol and Salford voted for. Mcr, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle etc against
@AlistairBurtMP great idea. I went in August
Come on Ed - it was a vote on whether people wanted to stay part of the UK
Very pleased that Scotland voted to stay in the UK. Any constituents with thoughts on next steps - please email me
@jamesethorpe feel free to email me any of your views
@Phillip_Blond and what about those who left cities deliberately eg mass exit from Liverpool in 80s when 15-20% moved away from Militant
@Phillip_Blond what if you don't live in a city or near one? Not all shires want unitary  councils
@Felixseasiders @OfficialHUFC you're welcome
@timpayton I disagree
@PickardJE that's a bit rude Jim..not what I expect of you
@PickardJE PM rightly refers to Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England ie the UK
@Geates Useful Q . Other assemblies don't have upper chamber but usually have coalitions so have to be sensible to get laws through.
PM rightly praises outcome and those involved in campaigns for both No and Yes. Next steps include settlement for all nations of the UK
@Geates will certainly prove interesting debate
@Geates why?
@balloutboi but fair to say that proposing policies/solutions for local and national issues is the essence of politics
@balloutboi I think you're a constituent so email me your views
http://t.co/6KizyIqShi ** with Highlands to declare, appropriate that West Lothian % resembles closest national results
UK OK #indyref
@PaulGoodmanCH @nickherbertmp I can honestly say the briefings by David M, Ruth D and Lorraine F were very encouraging. Glad Nick went up
Finished my GOTV for #indyref #nothanks
@PaulGoodmanCH English Tory MPs certainly were encouraged to help in Scottish referendum by going or phoning
@RealWitan good hard working yes of course. I want to see more women in Parliament too
@highfries @andrewpolitics No need to discriminate.we have some great women candidates and I hope one is successful
I'm hoping we may see another in Suffolk in BStEds
Good news that S Cambs will have a woman MP in 2015. http://t.co/X74aN4VpRd
@DPJHodges why? Labour got most English seats in 97, 01 and 05
@ONS how can we give feedback? You seem to have wiped out electoral parishes and made site 100 times slower
Disaster. @ONS has got rid of its brilliant election maps website with something "whizzier" but much worse. Please bring old site back
Focus should be on SNP silly claims on privatisation and their choices on NHS spending as it is a devolved matter
All need to be careful about the NHS £450 M cut claims. 200 M of that is extra NHS staff cost related to pensions
@bbclaurak how bad or chosen not to?
good night as #itfc win too. Two on the trot.
@JPFFMWright I suggest we await the result before discussing further. Hope Uni year 2 is good
@courtneylmower @jussiemow depends on whether Suffolk GPs decide to keep PMS contract or move to GMS contract (and not offer blood tests)
@IVETHEJIVE keep the faith. looking forward to next week
great stuff with last minute finish - a Liverpool speciality : ) #LFC
Blimey. Come on Stevie G #LFC
oh no #LFC
@jabberwockjohn @farlingayehigh Yes we are getting more. We were never at bottom but near it. I'm on record for fairer funding needed
Time now for football. Welcome back Champions League #lfc #YNWA
Done some of my calling for @UK_Together. A lady in Glasgow seemed amused a lady from Suffolk was calling her. She's voting no.
Thanks to Ms Hargadon at @farlingayehigh for showing me round the school today and a good chat
@McFarlandFraser thanks Fraser. Lookingforward to working with you
@RebeccaKeating thanks
@RebeccaKeating where is that Rebecca?
Looking forward to visiting Birchwood Primary School later as well as Saxmundham retail forum
@BB4Suffolk when are you going to update which postcodes/exchanges have been upgraded? No news for 2 months
@club_thorpe cctv? I'm only aware of that in larger towns
@club_thorpe where?
@Feline_Gardener with the phrase "fingers in the till", are you implying I have falsely claimed expenses ? If not, suggest you withdraw
@adamboultonSKY normally a breakfast cure for hangovers
#murnaghan good Q of Brian Cox. Yesterday he said he was an expat. Does he pay his main taxes in UK?
The World War I exhibition at Orford Museum is particularly good.well done to curator Jennifer, Chairman Michael and their team.
http://t.co/U7EPiH5b4a Caught end of this today. A really good vibe with lots of different boats. More events tomorrow
Well done to all involved in the Felixstowe Heritage Hub, particularly Mike Nimney.
Running late for Orford. Just had curious incident with an owl on the A12
Singing, music and step dancing outside SSRC #HeritageOpenDays http://t.co/2LYfJ1tjDQ
Events at Southwold Sailors' Reading Room celebrating 150 years and plenty on outside http://t.co/6HJp5hLBIK
@alanwhiteheadmp so finance companies own asset and leases out.At what cost/profit? How to guarantee car availability in rural UK?
Saxmundham, Southwold, Maritime Woodbridge, Orford WWI exhibition, Felixstowe Heritage Hub #SuperSuffolkSaturday
@gstokey yes he does say that
@gstokey "What if government simply regulated for cars to be sold and used just as they are at present but outlawed individual ownership?"
@radicalj yes RAF Felixstowe closed in 60s
I like Labour @alanwhiteheadmp but suggesting you should not own a car shows out of touch for most people of UK http://t.co/ZJHHecti3D
@radicalj their involvement in key work really helped us in the War
@janemerrick23 good song but always acceptable to knock and suggest they may not realise how loud it is - esp if they didn't warn you
#HeritageOpenDays http://t.co/81n6f7AUYL  Loads on in Felixstowe and the Suffolk Coast this weekend
Enjoyed #CastlesInTheSky ? Visit the actual Bawdsey transmitter block today 1230-430 as part of #HeritageOpenDays http://t.co/SP9WUTgyAF
@KerryMP he just gave credit to the Coalition Govt so well done. The Bill will get its Second Reading later today
@england what time is the game?
@KerryMP would be good for Gordon to congratulate @David_Cameron for reaching 0.7% aid spending. Gordon never managed to do so
@sarahhowardSAR @suffolkchamber @vincecable glad you enjoyed it
Good to see @claire4devizes cycling in to DfT bright and early this morning
Great to hear @BBCr4today focus on Sizewell B and nuclear power. Station director Jim Crawford on now. PS Dome/building IS iconic
Well done @netdunning and to all in #Halesworth on winning several gold medals from #AngliainBloom . Great team effort, great leadership
@ClareReads yup
@Harry_cartoons I wouldn't know how it's changed since then
@VoluntaryAnarch @IsabelHardman she is special but it's fake whalebones
@Harry_cartoons come and check it out
@MarilynChandle5 that's right which is why our coastguards around the country get more support and equipment. They're very happy in Suffolk
@MarilynChandle5 you may want to find some to ask, rather than rely on a 3rd party. They're volunteers, similar to RNLI but get Govt funding
Bus man's holiday at Scottish Parliament http://t.co/RckHO9rCot
Me and Merry atop Berwick Law. Going to have to improve selfie technique http://t.co/lRYYtxlpDK
@MarilynChandle5 as you look after yourself. I'm sure the NHS will help in that
@MarilynChandle5 I'm pleased then it was only the Conservatives who were committed to and have increased NHS spending. I hope you benefit
@MarilynChandle5 glad you have achieved so much in your life... I'm sure you're very proud
RIP Jim Dobbin. A true champion of prolife cause.
@FraserNelson I clocked up lots of air miles while working. Still have about 600,000 to use. LHR T4 nearly a second home
@FraserNelson final benefit isthat you can come to UK - drop in for meeting/visit - before moving on to next stop easily
@FraserNelson which means UK business / offices of overseas firms etc have enviable flight choice
@FraserNelson it means UK has v high frequency of planes to key cities around the world Fewer passengers = fewer flights (prob fewer cities)
@FraserNelson MCR and other airports have increased number of routes but if LHR loses transfers, we lose of key point to point connections
@FraserNelson every national airport tends to act as default hub but the importance of LHR is as international transfer hub
yet again TUC's Frances O'Grady being disingenuous. David Cameron CUT all ministerial salaries by 5 % and increased pension contributions.
@FraserNelson the hub concept is for international transfers, not domestic

@SuffolkTory AGM tonight. Great councillors and candidates ready to fight election on May 7th Fri Feb 27 18:48:49 GMT 2015
@isnomoney interesting Fri Feb 27 17:35:31 GMT 2015
I expect those who voted for Miliband in 2010 feel let down by him breaking his promise http://t.co/2S99f9NnBT Fri Feb 27 17:20:11 GMT 2015
Ed Miliband promised in 2010 to replace tuition fees with a graduate tax so he could win the leadership. Promise broken by Miliband today. Fri Feb 27 17:15:10 GMT 2015
@CroPage but assume you saw and heard everyone anwyay Fri Feb 27 12:25:21 GMT 2015

@akalionrule @montie can you let me know which MPs currently are on big co boards? I can name some peers Thu Feb 26 22:53:47 GMT 2015
@montie @timesredbox but he doesn't oppose all 2nd jobs, just directorships and consultancy. ok to be lecturer, lawyer, etc Thu Feb 26 22:48:00 GMT 2015
@Roystoncanary I have only just seen they're out. Sad. Thanks for that Thu Feb 26 22:11:58 GMT 2015
@IainDale that's not fair. Lucy is top journalist and check timeline of when BBC released it vs WPost Thu Feb 26 22:05:26 GMT 2015
great scoop by @lucymanning Thu Feb 26 22:03:08 GMT 2015
Great to be campaigning in CCHQ alongside @mimsdavies and @scullyp. I'm calling for @willquince #Team2015 Thu Feb 26 19:27:13 GMT 2015
Very interesting and insightful opening speech by Laura Sandys in the #epilepsydebate15 Thu Feb 26 15:31:17 GMT 2015
@CroPage wrong Caroline yet again but classic attempt by Lib Dems to smear.Sad really if that's what you're reduced to Thu Feb 26 12:53:14 GMT 2015
@CroPage and yet earlier you complained that my secretary emailed someone. Now getting bizarre. Thu Feb 26 10:26:10 GMT 2015
@CroPage classic LD faux outrage is the impression you are giving me but I accept that you are livid as I would not call you a liar Thu Feb 26 08:52:40 GMT 2015
@CroPage I am efficient Caroline. I don't want to have to send you two letters. Perhaps you are more carefree with taxpayers' money. Bye now Thu Feb 26 08:50:41 GMT 2015
@CroPage sadly this feels like faux outrage. You know I'm a Minister so I don't speak in backbench debates Thu Feb 26 08:49:45 GMT 2015
@CroPage I can't send you a link to the debate till after the debate has happened Thu Feb 26 08:47:01 GMT 2015
@CroPage and you will get that tomorrow Thu Feb 26 08:43:45 GMT 2015
@CroPage I don't know why you haven't had reply yet but on backbench debate business I usually wait until I can send you link to Hansard Thu Feb 26 08:42:47 GMT 2015
@CroPage though I expect you won't be complaining about Cable, Clegg, Davey or Laws not being in the debate Thu Feb 26 08:33:20 GMT 2015
@CroPage Bob is not a Minister so it's good he is attending backbench business debate. Like Cable or Clegg though I won't be at the debate Thu Feb 26 08:32:20 GMT 2015
@CroPage Hello Caroline, I will not be at that debate but as you know I will be working for the Coalition government Thu Feb 26 02:36:54 GMT 2015

@emmafreud I promise to watch on iplayer Wed Feb 25 20:32:18 GMT 2015

@BBCSuffolk great result Tue Feb 24 21:46:45 GMT 2015
Pretty shocking to accuse the Whips of scuppering Recall. It was a completely free vote and I voted with Zac #InsideTheCommons Tue Feb 24 21:44:35 GMT 2015
Patrick is a legend #InsideTheCommons Tue Feb 24 21:38:04 GMT 2015
@nicholascook contact your MP. He or she will arrange it Tue Feb 24 21:37:15 GMT 2015
@FoundationEast @EoECoop hope it goes well Tue Feb 24 07:27:19 GMT 2015
@BackNoMoreGames can you let me know of any doctors or other medical professionals that have prioritised profits over patient care? Tue Feb 24 06:47:23 GMT 2015
@BigM89 but thanks for your vote! Mon Feb 23 19:29:51 GMT 2015
@BigM89 where you now live Mon Feb 23 19:29:33 GMT 2015
@WillingtonSusan glad you did Mon Feb 23 10:44:13 GMT 2015
@Phillip_Blond @UndercoverMutha @Speaker_Bureau @SkyNews don't be silly Phillip. End of day 30 min adjournment debate. Mon Feb 23 10:43:38 GMT 2015
Hindu Council, MCB backing FB's amendment. Slight shame others seem to decry backing it on grounds of addressing values/respect for girls Mon Feb 23 10:29:59 GMT 2015
Slight whiff of racism from TUC comment about banning abortion on grounds of gender when it talks about risk of dividing communities. Mon Feb 23 10:28:10 GMT 2015
@VictoriaPeckham but in any event, I agree issue of girls being undervalued needs to be addressed. MCB etc supporting amendment Mon Feb 23 10:26:16 GMT 2015
@VictoriaPeckham In what way does it endanger health by having a baby girl, as opposed to a baby boy? Mon Feb 23 10:25:36 GMT 2015
@VictoriaPeckham not the only grounds, tho mental health of woman is majority of cases. I hope they're treated for mental health probs later Mon Feb 23 10:21:08 GMT 2015
@VictoriaPeckham if you think an expectant mother says "I want an abortion because I don't want a girl, I only want a boy" is that right? Mon Feb 23 10:19:05 GMT 2015
@VictoriaPeckham yes they can but on the basis for sole reason of being a girl or a boy, I don't think they should be allowed Mon Feb 23 10:17:58 GMT 2015
@yorkierosie @victoriapeckham I know that DoH gives guidance but http://t.co/Ag4CTsbaEY ; ex DPP Keir Starmer said nothing explicit in law Mon Feb 23 10:10:33 GMT 2015
@AldeburghR I hope so. Astonishingly TUC wants MPs to oppose the amendment Mon Feb 23 09:22:03 GMT 2015
@yorkierosie not explicitly. Former DPP Keir Sharmer confirmed that when he didn't bring charges against some doctors, relying on BMA notes Mon Feb 23 09:21:21 GMT 2015
I will probably also vote for Ann Coffey's amendment that gives a routemap on how to help enforce Fiona Bruce's amendment Mon Feb 23 08:56:32 GMT 2015
Today, I will be voting for Fiona Bruce's amendment to make it illegal to abort a foetus on the grounds of its gender. Mon Feb 23 08:55:34 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop  just being factual Tom. Goodnight. Sun Feb 22 21:27:02 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop NHS England funding is up Tom - again, you must be thinking of Labour in Wales who chose to cut their NHS budget. Sun Feb 22 21:19:11 GMT 2015
@JoeCulley yet again, pretty much wrong Joe. You are correct overall NHS spend Govt decision but CCG split an NHS one. Sun Feb 22 21:17:07 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop @JoeCulley When English NHS gets more £ (as it has), then block grant to Wales to use for its NHS also increases. Priorities Sun Feb 22 20:45:44 GMT 2015
.@TomBlenkinsop @JoeCulley no cuts to the NHS in England Tom. Of course, Labour is cutting the NHS in Wales. Sun Feb 22 19:43:08 GMT 2015
@JoeCulley @TomBlenkinsop not neutral at all. Already got rid of an entire Board, (including a Labour cllr) when they ignored rural patients Sun Feb 22 19:41:41 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop @JoeCulley as I said earlier, challenge CCG on its recommendations but don't mislead by saying "Cameron's cuts". CCG decision Sun Feb 22 19:40:18 GMT 2015
A bit surprised that most of focus on Suffolk so far in #countryfile is on a town swept away hundreds of years ago Sun Feb 22 19:13:55 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop you will have to ask Monitor on that. However, I can read what your own GP-led CCG says about MIUs in its policy paper. Sun Feb 22 19:11:17 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop http://t.co/u19vbFNgxm Sun Feb 22 19:09:55 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop but your own CCG commissioned review as said MIU used on average by 6 patients daily and so not best use of resource. Sun Feb 22 19:07:35 GMT 2015
@montie  amazingly @midwivesrcm wants MPs to vote against despite ex DPP Keir Starmer saying law does not prevent gender-specific abortion Sun Feb 22 17:27:55 GMT 2015
For now, enjoying the football. I expect @CllrPhilNorth won't be. #LFC Sun Feb 22 16:44:31 GMT 2015
For those of you who have never visited Suffolk, check out BBC Countryfile at 7pm tonight. You won't be disappointed Sun Feb 22 16:43:54 GMT 2015
@robert_g_oliver @Simon4Boro agrer Sun Feb 22 14:43:49 GMT 2015
As I thought Tom, CCG decision https://t.co/o2yB4CG8TQ Sun Feb 22 13:32:18 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop CCG commissions care for patients but sounds like TDA or Monitor job Sun Feb 22 13:09:52 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop by all means challenge your CCG but don't mislead people about who makes that decision nor that the NHS has been cut Sun Feb 22 12:11:59 GMT 2015
So we now have Labour MP @tomblenkinsop denying NHS funding risen and opposes local GPs making clinical decisions for patients Sun Feb 22 11:06:19 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop Lab criticised Govt for putting more into NHS and now you don't trust doctors to make best clinical decisions Sun Feb 22 11:03:59 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop that will be decision of local GPs and medical professionals running your CCF, not Govt Sun Feb 22 11:00:46 GMT 2015
@TomBlenkinsop shouldn't mislead your constituents. As you know NHS received £ billions more when Lab Shad Sec said irresponsible to do so Sun Feb 22 10:57:04 GMT 2015
@LibDemPress @dannyalexander very funny Sun Feb 22 09:32:47 GMT 2015
When did #marrshow paper review become uninterrupted party political broadcast? People booking reviewers should remember BBC is impartial Sun Feb 22 09:23:19 GMT 2015
Good day canvassing in Felixstowe and Martlesham. Nice to pick up plants at Katie's Walled Garden Sat Feb 21 16:18:36 GMT 2015

@BridgetBurke2 I did. Read the tweet. Fri Feb 20 18:54:08 GMT 2015
@Southwold_rnli yes you did but with new dog in tow. Hope you haven't been too busy? Fri Feb 20 15:53:34 GMT 2015
@gradgrind999 the quotation you give implies top 90 schools in the country, in top 90 for improvements and I welcome that Fri Feb 20 13:59:33 GMT 2015
@gradgrind999 not sure why Waveney is the benchmark Jeremy? Fri Feb 20 13:58:43 GMT 2015
@PlaceFarm why? Fri Feb 20 13:57:48 GMT 2015
@lazymum very odd thing to say but I will leave you to your own bubble Fri Feb 20 13:57:28 GMT 2015
@BridgetBurke2 why? Fri Feb 20 13:57:08 GMT 2015
@gradgrind999 Come on?  Rightly praised for improvements. Not in top 90 schools for actually results though. Sustained improvement needed Fri Feb 20 13:55:09 GMT 2015
@BuntyTrevanion @gradgrind999 they are and that's why rightly praised. Sustained improvement still needed Fri Feb 20 13:53:33 GMT 2015

@KarasAunty truth is you've got no answer to the question on how you'll run the economy without a currency. Answer please.
@KarasAunty @kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP so you want me to stop paying my staff? What a future for Scotland! Don't pay the workers!
@KarasAunty @kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP nationalism always ends up in the wrong place.
@KarasAunty @theSNP so your saying I shouldn't pay my staff?!?
@JensonBigCat agreed. But change your profile photo. I like James Stewart. #bettertogether
@JensonBigCat haha.
@JensonBigCat you poor soul
@KarasAunty @kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP oh dear, oh dear. So nationalism has fallen to this. I'm not even going to go there
@KarasAunty @kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP yes I know. Hope it doesn't hurt you too much.
@JensonBigCat do you really look like Nichols Cage?
@JensonBigCat belief in more economic regionalism, city regions and combined authorities. People want economic certainty not romanticism.
@LovingDalston @MichaelH14 @theSNP will need 2 find £6bn above austerity: how will u do that? Oil? Won't b a bonus it'll b a necessity
@JensonBigCat I agree I'm proud of my country I'm a social democrat that's why we should not create borders where they don't exist #indyref
@JensonBigCat and you've never heard of multinationals?
@KarasAunty @kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP now your just be rude
@JensonBigCat it's 2014 not 1922. Globalised economy now, wasn't then. Thought you'd know that with your interest in the FTSE
@kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP right, ok
@LovingDalston @MichaelH14 @theSNP so can I, it's called the UK. & it helps 2 b part of EU, something Scots won't be if they vote yes
@JensonBigCat now your being daft
@JensonBigCat size is important. I thought your interest in the FTSE would tell you that
@LovingDalston @MichaelH14 @theSNP and your point is
@meadwaj @ChukaUmunna @theSNP yeah & we r part of EU. A lot bigger I would of thought. If Scot gets independence they're not even a minnow
@kdudakia @ChukaUmunna @theSNP just how small do you want Scotland to be. We are better together. #indyref
@Jono_caulf85 @ChukaUmunna @theSNP I'll be voting to stay in the EU
@meadwaj @ChukaUmunna @theSNP exactly @theSNP want 2 make the UK smaller That's why EU is important & you've got that now & without the Euro
@AlexSalmond do the decent thing and answer the question on the currency and stop misleading your own people. #indyref
@Jono_caulf85 @ChukaUmunna @theSNP I'm pro reformed EU, we are better together
@Coulstock1 @MichaelH14 you are going to need to find £6bn above austerity. Oil revenue will be a necessity not a bonus
@444blackcat yeah, and can you afford to live there.
New economies like China will dominate 21stC & @theSNP want to make the UK smaller & Scotland even smaller Doesn't make sense #indyref
If @AlexSalmond can't answer currency question everything else falls by the wayside. @theSNP quest for independence built on sand. #indyref
If the Bank of England controls the £ independent Scotland can only use the £ in name only. Scotland will have no control over its economy.

@ericjoyce
@crawfordfulton @andywightman @CllrChasBooth So you're blaming the Scottish Government for Irvine's neglected public spaces?
@tomashirstecon @davidautor Oh, thank you. I will.
@tomashirstecon Thanks. It's certainly v interesting.
@tomashirstecon With that apparent scale of low/middle skill growth over just one year it must be quite easy to pinpoint cause?
@crawfordfulton @andywightman @CllrChasBooth If u talk of 'hollowing out' u need outcomes. Otherwise it's just wanking over process.
@crawfordfulton @andywightman @CllrChasBooth MPs spend most of their time on 'local issues which don't make it onto TV'.
@crawfordfulton @andywightman @CllrChasBooth The thing is, Crawford, I keep asking for specifics - in what ways small units were better?
@pcdjohnson @andywightman @lesleyriddoch Cool. In units of a few hundred. Cancer treatment. Thumbs.
@pcdjohnson @andywightman @LesleyRiddoch Go on. Tell me what they're voting for in units of 350 or 564 in 'contemporary' places....
@abisea @andywightman OK. So how is it in Cornwall?  *said sweetly*
@abisea @alistairwarwick @andywightman It's twitter. And read the string. What do you disagree with? Seriously…
@abisea @andywightman Bud, I just asked for substantiation of 'hollowed out' theory. None is forthcoming.
@digitalwestie @andywightman Ach, OK, I'll read it later…….damn.
@digitalwestie @andywightman Yeah. So, term, is that what you think constitutes a good read?
@digitalwestie @andywightman I've read his others. Maybe I missed the COSLA one…
@digitalwestie @andywightman No. Is that Cormac McCarthy?
@deasach @andywightman In the morning! I'll be there….
@deasach @andywightman How does that work?
@shirleysheyes @alistairwarwick @andywightman 'night, bud.
@thedreadedlurgy @andywightman You're right.
@shirleysheyes @alistairwarwick @andywightman How?
@thedreadedlurgy @andywightman Ha!
@shirleysheyes @alistairwarwick @andywightman Why not read the string instead of trolling?
Nothing then? Not a single thing you can think of was better in those unfollowed out days?
@alistairwarwick @andywightman Uh? Did you read the string? I'm waiting on the example of why un-hollowed out olden days were super. You?
@andywightman I'm off now. But you're 'hollowed out' stuff is patently bullshit. Do better.
@longhouses1 @andywightman @cllrchasbooth Who would you like to be accountable for you healthcare if you have cancer (25% chance)?
@andywightman If you want to say a thing was good, get yer empirical out.
@andywightman If you're going to wear the specs, you're going to have to think harder. The olden days were unbelievably shit.
@andywightman Don't be a daft wee boy. Man up.
@andywightman Hyper-empirical guy. Start with what people want and need. Education, health, water, power, etc. Then think from there.
@andywightman Name a single thing which was better in units of 4000 - before 'hollowed out'.
@andywightman No. And you know that.
@andywightman You can't just wear a wee pair of specs, bud. You have to think it through…
@andywightman Have you checked who represented in the olden days? Squires? Businessfolk? Churchmen? Famers? No plebs? Super.
@andywightman You're talking bollocks, right?
@andywightman So tell me about the quality of educational, sewage, health, any other service. Name one which was better in the olden days.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Note to your hyper-empirical researcher. 'Hollowed out' is pejorative.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Hey, Andy, just tell me a local service which was better in those 'not hollowed out' olden days.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Since you apply a pejorative to anything larger than 4000, what would you like to see decided at that scale?
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth You were talking about Scotland, I believe…..
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth You want villages to have their own 'sewage policy'? Jesus.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth But what's 'hollowing out'? They didn't have public services like education and health.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth What was the hospital policy in those brilliant days when the poor didn't have doctors?
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Just responding to your tweets about how great it was in the olden days. With tables.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Denny and Bonnybridge - diff sewage systems? Oh, and no public education. Good times.
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth Ah, uv checked now. So u think super idea of units of 4000 voters to have diff policies on those things?
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth You don't know, right?
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth What actual thing specifically?
@andywightman @cllrchasbooth What were those 4000-odd folk in the olden days voting on?
Hey, @joyjoymjoyce v nice to see you on Twitter! Get Tweeting….
@MrStevenMoore @Damian_Barr Nice! Hang on to to IPR for that, mind!
@MrStevenMoore @Damian_Barr It's time for a gay Christmas Carol.
@stephen_abbott Not sure u do. Rwandans well able to grasp UK politics without ur help. Being a website guy hardly makes u parly expert.
@stephen_abbott @ukparliament No motion of any sort could ever represent 'the whole of parliament'. That's not a motion's function.
@davebik @jndolipierre Thanks, and true. EDM's handy for raising pols and public awareness. BBC DG will certainly see.
@IrrancaDaviesMP @ChrisBryantMP @IsabelHardman what would you do?
@blanco_84 You may need a spade. Good luck! e
@blanco_84 Haha! No, it's IPSA and no-one but. That's what the public wanted. So you should write to IPSA…
@blanco_84 Yes. You have got the wrong body. Clue - Robin Cook has been dead for 9 years.
@blanco_84 Not with you….
So Luxembourg's a tax haven within EU. And where's its prime minister of 18 years? Er, running the EU, obv. http://t.co/aOal81yL0R

@blanco_84 5-6000 the number of jobs guaranteed by fracking the Falkirk area.
@blanco_84 Here's the unaccountable quango you're looking for http://t.co/DqDF326CDK
@blanco_84 Haha. OK? Is that it?
@blanco_84 By the way, you've got the wrong person and body. Hilarious, really.
@blanco_84 MP's pay not my job and I have no say. You, the public, demanded this.
@blanco_84 Really? You should ask him about that. Also ask about the MPs pay rise. He's your man by the sound of it.
@Blanco_84 My constituents are overwhelmingly in favour of fracking. Thousands of jobs dependant, too.
@Blanco_84 The public demanded MPs put all power over our pay into hands of an unaccountable quango. So we did. You don't like that now?
@gabyhinsliff @iainmartin1 Blimey, I hope not. But one of us has to go, I think...
@richardosman @phlaimeaux At 6'6" and 23 stones, he was a fast runner, showing everyone a clean pair of heels hurdling on Sports Superstars.
@gabyhinsliff @iainmartin1 Maybe it's simply time to sweep away all the political commentators and bring in a new bunch?
@Blanco_84 Surely it's scandalous that you want MPs to have a say in their own pay?
@blanco_84 Do you want MPs to decide their own pay? Or do you want them not to?
@British_Airways ? Thanks, Emma.
@tomwatsonmp Shouldn't @benemmerson1 simply chair the inquiry? Or does it need to be someone with a famous name or title already?

@BBCNewsnight Melanie Reid interview so good it's hard to think of what's on now.....
@Moranus812 @daily_politics @sunpoliticsmids @JackDromeyMP it's a profoundly important question. Certainly a lot higher than 15%.
@sunpoliticsmids @jackdromeymp @daily_politics Fair enough. How many voted in Unite leadership election? (ans - 15%)
@shottsjimmy @eljmayes Exactly. If pols want less smoking they need to say where they'll get the revenues from instead. But they don't.
@poet_peoples I completely agree, though. The public health officials fighting vaping are doing us a terrible dis-service.
@poet_peoples If vaping works out (which I hope it does) then it'll be taxed more heavily, but the 'moral dividend' will be lower than fags.
@poet_peoples Yeah, I was. But I introduced a new dimension, 'cos I can tell you're clever.
@poet_peoples @andybolton Why don't we tax dangerous sports heavily?
@MekQuarrie Fair enough, but if you fund health spending from smoking you need to say what you'll do as smoking continues to decline. No?
@poet_peoples @andybolton Yep. The NHS needs smokers.
If you fund something from 'tobacco company profits' does that mean you want to close it down?
@Daveparke78 Did you read the piece, bud? Fracking creates thousands of jobs. I'm for those jobs. You?

@chrisdeerin @janemerrick23 You know where to point your webcam....
@VeryBritishDude I whip myself these days. It works for me....
@LemonInZurich Yeah, also, there's a terrible shortage of extremist politicians selling snake-oil populist poison to the desperate.
@janemerrick23 @chrisdeerin Maybe. Or SAS stake-out? Or pervert with binoculars watching folk come and go?
It's time we had a lot more indignant hypocrites loudly voicing support for infantile, self-serving, escapist, political pseudo-philosphies.
@chrisdeerin @janemerrick23 Surely an opportunistic crapper wouldn't just happen to have toilet paper on them? Something more 'specialist'?
@ldobsonhughes @sfharris Someone high up's getting twitchy.
@jsoosty1 Back home, eating Indian (food) and reading your wise comments. All is fine in the world….
@barton71 Unite who want to close down fracking in UK, including thousands of of their own members' jobs? Yeah, possibly.
Hooray for fracking and jobs in Falkirk http://t.co/CcDDwJToRU
@drlizamorton @larbertred No, I quite specifically blame Unite and a greedy few who forgot about normal folk.
@drlizamorton @larbertred It's  tough, but it's not insulting. Unite's disregard for workers was insulting.
@drlizamorton @larbertred shed staff for good. Actually bad. Unite forgot to mention?
@drlizamorton @larbertred Ah, you don't know. When your husband voted himself out of a job, other employes in the supply chain  (1of2)
@mjrharris @pinterest I'm outclassed there. Was running through ancient philosophy degree and regimental mottoes….
@drlizamorton @larbertred You're aware that hundreds of local supply chain workers actually lost their jobs, right?
@drlizamorton @larbertred Nope. it's a tiny minority concern. Better off folk like yourself with too little to worry about.
@drlizamorton @larbertred Is that the extent of evidence of your 'factual errors', doc?
@mjrharris Nemo me impune troll.
@drlizamorton @larbertred Factual errors? Go on….

@johannabaxter Is it a BBC variation on "Who'd live in a house like this". Only much crueller?
@lisalovescheese  @scotgp Cool. You stick with PR & green nationalism (?) and I'll stick with thousands of local non-PR jobs.
@lisalovescheese @falkirkgreens @scotgp Thought maybe it was Scottish cheddar or something. Cheese jobs for Scot kids. #greencheesemanifesto
@lisalovescheese @FalkirkGreens @scotgp Yeah, we ARE creating jobs. That's why fracking's so great. So, ur in PR, then....
@FalkirkGreens I deal with your anti-science in the blogpost. It's not your job at threat, though, is it, I'm guessing?
@JamesCo77979225 Did you actually read the piece?
@p13grf @aDissentient thanks.
@HeatherKerr1 it's impossible to have an intelligent chat if ur premise is that fracking causes thalidomide risk to foetuses.
@digitalWestie it spells everything out in detail, with references.
@heatherkerr1 Don't be silly. And go read about Thalidomide.
@digitalwestie Go on…..
@HeatherKerr1 Wait a mo - replying by email. Check in 15 mins....

@HeatherKerr1 See my last tweet.
Fracking is good for Falkirk. Shame nimbys, Unite and SNP hate the thousands of jobs it brings. http://t.co/CcDDwJToRU
@falkirkdouglas @NenaOveja I am truly staggered at your ignorance of local job market. I'll blog especially for you.
@d4maths @Cavalorn No owls were harmed during the filming of 'Wicker Man'. Probably.
@CNgwije I hate holocaust denial. I won't enter into a discussion on it.
@falkirkdouglas @NenaOveja do you really live in Falkirk?
@CNgwije no-one's an angel, v true. The programme was a shocking travesty.
@falkirkdouglas @NenaOveja by securing the future of extant jobs, obv.
@falkirkdouglas @NenaOveja 'Protected and assured', not 'currently dependent'.
@falkirkdouglas @NenaOveja Thousands of jobs in my constituency have been protected and assured, in the end, by fracking.
Super Ed Sheeran interview on @BBCr4today Intellectual Property ref followed on nicely from G'peace patenting discussion.IP so interesting.
@nenaoveja Can't help finding your response pathetic. Grow up.
@nenaoveja OK. DM me, tell me when's good.
@chaz01br Amazing. I remember it almost became a byword for exotica of a type then got blown up. Must go sometime.
@nenaoveja See you tomorrow, then?
@nenaoveja I don't 'supposedly' represent you. I actually do. And the 5000 folk who benefit from fracking. So when and where?
@nenaoveja Uh? You want to chat about it tomorrow? Are are you all social media mouth and no trousers?
@jmchools @irvinewelsh Holy shit! £10200 for one event? Next time, I'm definitely doing the paperwork for that £90 Guardian piece…
@chaz01br Where's that amazing place you're at there, on the balcony?
Two English conservatives on #bbcnewsnight telling us all how the union works. Hmmm.
@HeatherKerr1 does that pretty much do it?
@HeatherKerr1 on the other, we have an international&moral obligation to help democratic state asking 4 help against murderous anarchists.
@HeatherKerr1 Fracking's great news. It's already assuring over 5000 Falkirk-area jobs now and into the future.
@heatherkerr1 Hmmm. I'll check in the morning. Fracking?

@johnashtone @maggielavan @midwivesrcm Might be a common theme….
Top-tip for @MidwivesRCM - if you're going on strike, put up a woman and not a middle-aged bloke as your spokesperson….
@LemonInZurich I don't believe there's any chance of a Labour defection to UKIP at all. Daft UKIP fantasies is all.
@rk70534 a desire for peaceful co-existence - not war, is essential.
@cameroon2076 You think it's complacent not to stop 'Africans'?
Whoa. A Briton has died in Macedonia, obviously not of Ebola. Let's stop all 'Africans' at our borders. No, wait, let's not.
@jackschofield @indiaknight Me too!
@jackschofield @indiaknight Yeah, but there's two of us at this kitchen table and we're both in awe....:-)
@jackschofield @indiaknight Me too! I scottified Perkins...!
@jackschofield @indiaknight And, moreover, you are THE Jack Schofield. On yon Twitter machine. How exciting…:-)
@jackschofield @indiaknight Yes: "Private McTavish, at this point a futile gesture is called for…."
@indiaknight Option B for me. Fancy salmon? Yum. Breakfast, dinner and tea.
@reivers2014 You got the 'zero' bit, yeah?
So, let's see….there's been zero ebola cases in UK. So we'd better 'screen' all 'Africans' arriving on trains and planes? Er, maybe not?
@owais00 Also with genuine respect, btw.
@owais00 I'm afraid you can. There's no point denying it. No-one wants permanent war. So there have to be obvious preconditions.
@owais00 Why? The lack of preconditions seems a recipe for permanent war, doesn't it?
I am sad for the Scottish and Southern @sse  Orang Utan https://t.co/MbAZmeLrpj Will there be follow-up ad with a happy ending?

“@DarrenCarnegie: Labour, Tory..Tory, labour-same hypocrisy #the45 #GlasgowsNeedy #HopeOverFear http://t.co/leAO46VOuD” 1of2” @neilmackay
@darrencarnegie I don't believe you. Would you like to explain your tweet I just RT'd?
@darrencarnegie Your professional publicist, LYM media called first. And ur obviously using foodbank to campaign for SNP/Yes.
My last was a tweet from the organiser of George Square foodbank, actually at the foodbank, campaigning for SNP/Yes against Labour.
“@DarrenCarnegie: Labour, Tory... Tory, labour - same hypocrisy #the45 #GlasgowsNeedy #Glasgow #HopeOverFear http://t.co/leAO46VOuD” 1of2
@eveirecarolina @iindyef1876 @jammach haha! Och, you are a one…:-)
@eveirecarolina @iindyef1876 @jammach "You've no spine" "You wouldn't know what hard work was if your life depended".Ur account been hacked?
@eveirecarolina @iindyef1876 @jammach I see you alternate abuse and tweets which make you look reasonable. Don't be silly.
@cpuffy @writerjwhitehou @mifalkirk1 @helixfalkirk The organisers were wholly political - are you unaware?
@cpuffy @writerjwhitehou @mifalkirk1 @helixfalkirk Not if it's another Yes/SNP stunt designed to politically exploit the less well-off.
@wee162 I agreed with that cut. But Yes wants lower corporation tax still, yes?
@simonepereirahi Why's that? Ah, you haven't  bothered to check, have you?
@jammach @barryhutchison Fair do's!
@thegreedygirl Erm, is that seriously the limit of your counter-argument?
Interesting piece on Polish gender quotas, but surely the result is specific to particular types of society? http://t.co/xnxEqMzMnG
@jammach It's a short piece, so you should have cracked it in an hour or so. With assistance.
@jammach Have you read the article you're criticising me for, dimwit?
@deborahjaneorr Haha!
For the dimwits hurling abuse who've clearly not read the article http://t.co/bjyOGJgyDn
@utlr86 @discodave581984 By reading the article?
@a2mac @neilmackay It's mutual…:-)
@neilmackay You can write what panicked lies you like. Unless u delete timeline, it's clear ur all about encouraging abuse. Goodnight bud.
@darrencarnegie of George Square foodbank had his paid publicist, Billy Kilpatrick of LYM media, contact me today. @richardwalker5
@darrencarnegie @neilmackay @newsundayherald @neilmckay @richardwalker5 No, back to your paid publicist, LYM media.
@neilmackay @newsundayherald @neilmckay @richardwalker5 U'll be a paid Grammar boy? In any case, I was referring to ur paper's ads.
@DarrenCarnegie @NeilMackay @newsundayherald @neilmckay @richardwalker5 I had your professional publicist on the 'phone earlier....
If you're looking for a private school in Glasgow area, you'll want @newsundayherald  Ask @neilmckay or @richardwalker5 for discounts.
“@richardwalker5 @NeilMackay shame , poor victim , your now on the beast list, you tweet , we respond ! enjoy your new found fame xx”
@alasdairmackie I guess when you edit a vanity publication you have to go with the mob @newsundayherald @richardwalker5 (Head boy)
@anniekray Top tip, bud. Search my name on Twitter and see the thousands of abuse tweets. You are The Mob.
Donald, does the idea excite you?
Hey, the @newsundayherald  try reading my piece and arguing rather than simply urging the baying mob onwards. @richardwalker5 U get a bonus?
@therailbridge Try not to threaten on Twitter. @newsundayherald didn't mean to drive you to violence.In all seriousness.
Just for balance, Yes mob http://t.co/i2VRhJgqfE and http://t.co/uKnpQvGwsB Try reading and thinking sometime.
@Harry_Bhoy @NeilMackay Of course I'll get mad abuse from Yes folk. I'll get no reasoning. That's the way it is with the mob.
@roonaay1 No, just the many Yes folk hurling abuse.
Hey, the Yes mob, you are pathos personified. Try thinking and putting together an argument sometime.
@NeilMackay Do you have an argument, or is it ALL about using the mob to sell your writing (see ad on Twitter)?
@NeilMackay I'm entirely responsible for my own arguments. Do my best to deal on Twitter, too. Can't see any arguments come back at me...
@NeilMackay Twitter's a super medium, Neil. I have no complaints (libel aside) re: angry Yes-men and women. U have, of course, stoked abuse.
@lisalisa_hello @WeAreNational Oh, yeah, and you're retweeting abuse. Congratulations.
@lisalisa_hello @WeAreNational You have an SNP govt.Uv never used the 3p in pound.U put free tuition fees for middle-class b4 the poor.
@Into_Th3_Wild @NeilMackay The moronic abuse is coming from one angle only, as helped along by @newsundayherald staff. No reasoning at all.
@TamMcdade Well I suppose you're trying to understand...I'm not an MSP.
@into_th3_wild @neilmackay That's democracy, i guess. Neil's been stoking abuse day and now he's trying to look sensible.
@lisalisa_hello @wearenational Reducing public policy to food banks and the mob is the opposite of social democracy.
@lisalisa_hello @wearenational No,that's taxation and public policy,not failing to use Scot tax powers &handing out food 2 'deserving poor'.
@tammcdade No, I'm not.
@redlandsbhoy @neilmackay Reducing politics to food banks and mob abuse is the classical right wing way….
@Laura_220107 @eveirecarolina @joek1974 yeah, another killer attack.
@NeilMackay You've been re-tweeting to generate continuous abuse for the whole day. No hint whatever of debate.
@laura_220107 It's true that if we didn't have staff, offices or travel to parliament it'd save a lot of money….
@johnrentoul Yeah, during 'Friends' circa 1998.
@davidnisbet87 You mean, 'lost'?

@janeygodley Night. We'll speak tomorrow, 'though perhaps not directly.
@misterhsk @ewan1876 @janeygodley Hey,Hardeep, you should feel bad about ur tenants and those folk at the BBC.But u didn't apologise, right?
@janeygodley @misterhsk Janey, you're obviously reading these tweets. I'd simply ask again not to spread or repeat libels as you are.
@janeygodley I'm being helpful. Pause and consider. Stop drinking. Ask a lawyer in the morning. Then apologise.
@janeygodley Yes.
@misterhsk Wherever did you learn 'isnae' at your public school, Hardeep?
@janeygodley Janey, you've knowingly libelled me twice so far. Could I ask you politely to desist?
@misterhsk But, hey, Hardeep, this IS your only gig. Goodnight, this time x
@misterhsk Er, and you'll accept a gig from anyone who'll hire you. Obv no-one who remembers your dodgy record on flats or at BBC.
@figheadair45 @mamapartick @misterhsk @janeygodley @neilmackay How about voting against bedroom tax while SNP stayed away?
@misterhsk @bigaggiemac @janeygodley Hardeep, just accept it, no-one thinks your funny and at the BBC they actually hate you.
@sgough89 @misterhsk I'll write about that in the morning. Watch @misterhsk he's utterly desperate.
@misterhsk If I have any folk asking me for advice on how to rent a sub-standard flat I'll send them your way.
@misterhsk I'm drawing attention to your staggering hypocrisy.Away & find another sub-standard flat to let. And another u-know-what.G'night.
@misterhsk So, bud, what are you going to say about my claims?
@misterhsk I've made claims about you all over my tweets, bluffer. And you've retweeted as you're so proud.
@misterhsk As you, slum landlord and you know what, are history in the entertainment industry.
@misterhsk You proud of your service to Glasgow with your slum flats? Or your BBC suspension for you-know-what..http://t.co/1GfgaVaSQo
@misterhsk Luckily, not on rent in your slums http://t.co/Zp0kX7hFIv
@misterhsk What's your's by the way? Obv not slum landlord still? Or TV guy? Or actually funny at all. So let us know…
@misterhsk You tell me, bud. You're the one who was suspended from the BBC..
@misterhsk So, anyway, how's the job going. You back at BBC after suspension for you-know-what?
@misterhsk Bit necky from slum-landlord boy, surely?
@neilmackay I guess you're desperate, bud. Goodnight.
@neilmackay Bud, you're supposed to be a news journalist, not a cheerleader. i'm mocking and deriding you.
@Kelvinbhoy It's a stunt. Less of the 'less of', unless you're a daft we boy.
@NeilMackay @missjuliewooly Yeah, let's not quietly help the poor, let's make a photo-op of them for the Sunday Herald to be proud of.
@Kelvinbhoy it's a sick-making stunt. But I guess you see everything in terms of yes/No so you won't see that.
@bingomouse75 @NeilMackay @missjuliewooly 'Hey, look at us, we're getting folk to put food in George Square to show how super we are".
@NeilMackay @bingomouse75 @missjuliewooly Why George Square? To show everyone how super the collectors are?
@christophmccann Will! e
@christophmccann I do, often. Get yourself out onto that estuary….!
@BBC6Music goes to midnight with the surprising 'Goodnight Sleeptight'. https://t.co/lQUIc8hOPQ
@JamesCo77979225 @JohannLamont It's real, alright.
@christophmccann Mad! Also, like your Dundee thing.Dundee is ace, but I like to keep it quiet so it doesn't get clogged up...
@stvharry Harry, Is it policy for @WeAreSTV policy 2 say 'England-only but with Scot votes' when covering conf releases on Health/Education?
@holyroodmandy @TatlerUK That's is most definitely the spirit. Neoprene's stretching beyond its natural elasticity. It may blow.  :-)
@holyroodmandy @TatlerUK Erm, yeah, OK Mandy. Let's call it 'messy eating'.... See you Friday.
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk I was sent this pic of Lib Dem dress code for last week's party in Lerwick. http://t.co/lhOqcX6tDT Will it do?
@melspence2 @hazelbagend Ah, the days…
Tax on tobacco will fund NHS - but just in England, right? Or will Westminster still fund+control NHS in Scotland? http://t.co/B6mFjNkSqd
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk Super. We have our giant rat ready for the picket. Then we'll see u inside for dinner in Great hall,  7.30 for 8?
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk M16 has made it clear ur hired entire Downton Abbey staff 7 days a week. So can we have a turret room next Fri?
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk So, er, Mandy, when we gonna get that invite to your pad for caviar and eggs and stuff? http://t.co/iwdplmYPSa
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk This is breakfast. ALL OF IT. With 6 eggs. Scambled on the faces of socialists. Say Scottish Tories…
@holyroodmandy @tatleruk They can get two of these before they pay mansion tax, so it mainly fine http://t.co/0xAyiJ7Idk
@JohannLamont tweet about being a 'crusader' misses one or two cultural subtleties.Hey @paulbsinclair who wrote it, it's self-parody, right?
“@JohannLamont: Let us be the crusade the Labour Party was put on earth to be.We are the change makers. Let us change the world. #Lab14” Uh?
2moro's papers say Labour will levy mansion tax to fund Health.Health in England-only with Scottish MPs votes? Or is 'Home Rule' a fiction?
@malcolmchishol1 @oldhoneyman @eva_wilt Yep. http://t.co/peHLckPoHj
@WingsScotland @MalcolmChishol1 @OldHoneyman @eva_wilt  Yeah. All that olde-worlde sitting around going 'blah'?
@malcolmchishol1 @oldhoneyman @eva_wilt Uv noticed how new pols usually linked to effective social media? Uv just shown the opp is true….
“@MalcolmChishol1: @OldHoneyman @ericjoyce @eva_wilt Lots of people asking on Saturday twitter so I retweeted the motion twice over then!”
@BrianHaroldRead Maybe. Do you think Love and forgiveness will fix ISIS?
@OldHoneyman @eva_wilt Yes, that's what I'm hoping. That's why I wrote the piece.
@jchabeeb @imckenzied @guardian I'm afraid the English have rejected putting vast new powers in the hands of their local councillors.
@oldhoneyman @eva_wilt Keep asking…..
@OldHoneyman @eva_wilt No,u don't understand because first u confused my objective and now u don't see that it's Labour's gift, not Tories.
@iMcKenzied @guardian No. That phenomenon is integral to any parliament (think fishing).For voters, Scottish devolution is different....
@OldHoneyman @eva_wilt You misunderstand my objective. I want the UK parliament to fix the #wlq before GE2015.
@iMcKenzied @guardian My argument isn't philosophical.It's about voters,Scots and English,demanding that Scot devolution is fair to England
My piece at @Guardian For Labour, it's fix the West Lothian Question before GE2015 or get busted  #WLQ #indy http://t.co/m9eX9BBRyR
@rjcmayne @MissLilySummers @HouseofTwitsLab Everything devolved to Scotland.
@MissLilySummers @HouseofTwitsLab Pointless. Overwhelming support for two-tier MPs. Anyway, v nice chatting. But now, to bed....
@MissLilySummers @HouseofTwitsLab Yep.See regional assemblies and local govt in big cities like Birmingham.More jobs for politicians?No way.
@MissLilySummers But be sure about one thing. If Labour tries to avoid #wlq in coming months, Scots and English alike will punish next year.
@misslilysummers @houseoftwitslab English folk won't accept another layer of govt, so it has to be two-tier MPs; or federalism.
@misslilysummers @houseoftwitslab You really don't need another layer when you have MPs there to do that job already, surely?
@MissLilySummers @HouseofTwitsLab Would you prefer an extra layer of government - that's the question.
@BlueEyedSoulMan @JamesKelly I can't win then, can I? ;-)
@BlueEyedSoulMan @JamesKelly No, ur still confusing % vote as a prop of registered voters with % vote as prop of turnout.Never mind..
@BlueEyedSoulMan @JamesKelly With 37%, u expressed Yes vote as prop of registered voters.On historical 60%+ turnout,30%+ would be 50% vote.
@BlueEyedSoulMan @JamesKelly Ironically, in the latter case you've confused % of electorate with % of turnout.
@dharmabum013 @WingsScotland But you were referring to something I'd written. Anyway, you want a one-party state?
@dharmabum013 @WingsScotland It's the only option for Labour in Scotland, surely?
@CraigMurrayUK You're about to get one....
@StratRH Thanks.
@PatersonHugh @WingsScotland No. I've laid out what each party's saying they'll do if they win....
@solobasssteve Thanks, Steve. V glad.
Scottish referendum - A lie won't fly http://t.co/naiUwWujUb
@PolProfSteve @LordAshcroft @ConHome Two thirds?
@WyeLea @yanic1965 Hmmm. Are they 14? Is that Zen or something?
@Davoutt our thinking's beginning to coalesce. I c the possibilities....
@davoutt An' see that local Yes office? It's locked up. Dustballs are blowing around the street. "Hen, whaur's the oaffice gone?"
@davoutt Ah,you're making the elementary mistake of thinking I'm talking about the actually hot one.I'm not,I'm talking about the other one.
@OShaugnessyB @YES_DandD Ah, wait you have a big Yes poster in your window, right? That's why you didn't see me, dimwit.
@OShaugnessyB @YES_DandD Where were you? I didn't see you either. Bluffer.
@Davoutt The one that was like the hot in unhot way in one in Scooby Doo - Daphne? - she's still with us. As she was then.
@WyeLea @yanic1965 Which does, if you think about it, but I know you won't, make you the dimmest guy on Twitter. Ever. No?
@WyeLea @yanic1965 Mind u,since you said it to me you must have thought it was only u who knew one of the most famous political quotes ever.
@WyeLea @yanic1965 So it's, like, just you and me? Is that your thesis?
@Davoutt Our Wullie's about 75 these days. That's true. However, a'body grows up an' a' that. An' thae young ains....
@Davoutt take 'em out. Like Pol Pot?
@TyroneTeri cuts both ways, TT.
@WyeLea @yanic1965 doesn't EVERYONE know that?
@Michex69 @EdwardHarkins Aw, that's a shame. Oh well. One party state, then?
@babyboos I have 'til May. There's time yet.
@roddy1314 @WingsScotland sun Lapsang Suchong: "respect ur enemy".
Re: my last. Peter Kellner, nor any Yougov sap, ever said that. I made it up. Just so everyone knows, like. Actually, my account was hacked.
Yougov's Peter Keller just said; "Yeah, our figures swung around like a Glaswegian drunk who just discovered crack. But,hey,that's Scotland"
@IamChirurgicus @Cardiff_Airport "Why, your hands, Mr McGarva.They are your fortune.U have the hands of a pianist"."Actually, er, how big?".
@silverstrivers @fnicolson erm, have I walked in on a domestic?
@silverstrivers @fnicolson Oooh. Cheeky...
@IamChirurgicus @Cardiff_Airport Hmmm, yeah, well, i think you're doing something clever there. With words.
@Exiled_Fifer No, SNP has bagged the Glasgow left.
@fnicolson I think it's a moral responsibility for several enormously able Labour MPs to get themselves to Holyrood.
@duckfundee Labour could win in 2016 against SNP w/o Salmond. But they need a serious leader with a seriously capable team behind.
@rubeusflint Actually, says me. And I've as much right to an opinion as you.
@iamchirurgicus @cardiff_airport I did a course once. That's all, Mr Catty.
'Scottish Labour' desperately needs to change the guard immediately, too.
@humanpluralist I don't think he'll be short of offers…;-)
@iamchirurgicus @cardiff_airport Do not drink from the red things. They're important safety equipment.
@chrisdeerin He might get back those natural Scottish conservatives for whom actually voting Tory is an assault on their sensibilities…
Taking Yes to 45%, and all the rest, makes Alex Salmond a front rank politician of any age.
@WingsScotland @MrCrowleyoto Government can't bind successor. No time to finish legislation b4 election - too contentious for 'wash-up'.
@MrCrowleyoto @WingsScotland There's a lifetime supply of Tunnock's teacakes in there too if you look closely enough..
@wingsscotland Timetable for draft legislation. I'm sure it'll be on time…I guess folk didn't read the small print.
Uh,oh; hours after 'No' vote win announced, devo+ legislation already delayed to beyond 2015 election…http://t.co/BRaKERhtXo
The English won't let Scots win with menaces…http://t.co/mOHx5SMyyN #indyref #wlq
@JakeGoodman1 Thanks!
@LouiseMensch Scots can't have ANY vote on Health if devo promise holds. Bet Cameron limits it to committee stages. Let's see.....
@LouiseMensch I think that was a typo. You meant 'for Labour' there, right?
I'm getting strong reports that everyone's selling Yougovs and Peter Kellners.
"Give us a lot more money or the union gets it". English MPs may feel the referendum was won with menaces - on them and their constituents.
Falkirk count v orderly and civil. Friendly chats with Yes folk. No folk think close but winning.
@CalJamieson 8 points or more for No. Or maybe less....
@skynews "Scots have been given a chance to rip apart the union". Like a telephone directory. In the olden days."That's England ripped oot".
North Lanarkshire counting officer just said on @SkyNews : "Did you just call me a count?" Actually, he didn't. Would have been interesting.
@steverichards14 Make that 2am.
@KevinGall67 Well, it's a cheerio from me, weird hateful guy.
Orkney counting officer says; "We're being cautious". Really? Apparently, he ruled out being Escobar's enforcer in 1st at yon university....
@KevinGall67 haha, then enjoy...;-)
@jamesdo24914230 7 or 8 points? More? Not especially close.
Guardian wrong here (scroll down slightly) - No exit polls because TV hyped close finish and know it won't be one. http://t.co/UMJGS1GF7T
@KevinGall67 BTW, your friend there. Does he know you're sending sexual stuff to strangers online? Will he be upset?
@KevinGall67 Is that your interest? Fair enough. I'm not your man, though.
@TheGtLeonardo @JohnKennedyJnr So your view on clubs which ban women? And your comments to date?
@thegtleonardo @johnkennedyjnr Absolutely not. Super game. Just clubs which ban women in 21st Century. You?
@thegtleonardo @johnkennedyjnr Why not check the list of new members?
Alice Gross gross case -  Killers released on licence must get permission to move - were UK  cops informed at time? http://t.co/WRKKLHQeGP
@MekQuarrie Aw. Sweet, really. Hope destroyed.
At Andrews R&A golf club proudly announces, in 2014, that women are now allowed. Just privileged ones, mind.
@johnestevens No. It's not true.
@wingsscotland They do. It's all over, bud. 'til next time…
@ddonnachie94 @melindiscott 'bye then.
@paulypiper Yep. That's my point.
@ddonnachie94 @melindiscott Is your 100% true, then?
@ddonnachie94 @melindiscott Look it up, dimwit.
@melindiscott Yeah. V true. I hate myself for the misplaced possessive apostrophe, though….
@ddonnachie94 @melindiscott Uh. a. you made the latter bit up. b. The question is whether it's true or not.
@paulypiper The main thing is the odds, it's that few are taking advantage of them. Ergo, no-one believes them.
@melindiscott @ddonnachie94 Yeah, I think that's more likely than 100% turnout - maybe the staff toilet door's stuck?
@colinfawkes Nah, 1-5 today tells its own story. Lack of exit polls r media's way of keeping story going for the day…
So, bookies odds now 1-5 versus 11-2.   Media still saying 'too close to call'…..
@untitledfalkirk Has no-one told you it's all over, bud?
@afcrdmark But they're totally everywhere I go. Hiding….
@AFCRDMark Damn, do you think it might just be paranoia?
@ericjoyce: Posting cops outside polling stations is preferable to having them, slightly insidiously, hiding inside close to ballot boxes.
Why the Scottish newspapers said 'No' http://t.co/eBkduC0bw4 #indyref
@botzarelli @StraightBat1 @WikiGuido Ur right Green parties across the world should use; "the quicker we use all the oil up,the better".
@StraightBat1 @WikiGuido Fair enough.
@mr13alls @wikiguido I'm pretty sure it's the Green Party which owns all the wind, though I'm not sure how they heat it before emission…
@disamagic @mulder1981 e.g GM. They're also weirdly right-wing very often. e.g. use taxes to reduce consumption by the poorest.
Hey, the Green Party, the pro-independence argument is wholly founded upon maxing production and use of fossil fuels. You know that, right?
@garimaccoll @kateflett meant 'showing'. We had jokes for 30 first.
@ukip2014 I was watching on my laptop. But i was referring to telly. Scot 30 mins late bcos of cheap a daft programme about jokes.
@boogarry haha! You do understand what i was referring to, right?
@boogarry Just now?
I do wonder how many British folk know #bbcnewsnight isn't shown in Scotland...
In Scotland, Instead of #bbcnewsnight discussion about Scotland, we have people with dogs telling jokes, against a white background.
@themoogs83 I put that on ages ago. Present odds won't affect my 300k return…
@dboy_2010 My point is, why aren't bets flooding onto Yes right now?
@briangoldie48 no by 7 or 8 points? Not close. Bad if No wins narrowly.
Bookies giving 1-4 on Yes. Polls say close to 50-50. No flood of bets on Yes. Folk don't believe polls, right?
@moylesno1fan Why?
@newsnetscotland @clarknat You should tell the BBC about that. They might want to put it on their website…
@clarknat @gerald_ashley @naebd I am. Ur in it. Gimp-suit clad tweeter who likes to experiment with farmyard animals.
Last night's mild stuff from old-fashioned Falkirk SNP lads (some a bit insidious, frankly) was first and only silliness I've experienced.
@dennynews @falkirk_herald Damn. Kirsty and Chris, and also scary Jill are all super. But Colin's not. He's a bad man…
@dennynews @falkirk_herald Cancel my sheep metaphor. It wasn't fair on journalists and, worse, was horribly mixed….
@dennynews @falkirk_herald Sure, but you have an editor, no?
@dennynews @falkirk_herald I mean, I appreciate your editor's on the way out and journo's being sacked like sheep. But, you know, ffs.
@dennynews @falkirk_herald Good stuff. So your paper was looking for a quote from me on why Falkirk folk swear so much. Day b4 referendum?
@falkirk_herald You seem to have filled one with chair of Yes campaign - you've never quoted Falkirk MP once on the issue.
@falkirk_herald Yesterday, u asked me for quote not about most important vote ever, but about why Falkirk folk swear so much. Jesus..2of2
@davidasnp @alistairjegray @wingsscotland Falkirk SNP - still full of the old, abusive ones. I see.
@davidasnp @alistairjegray @wingsscotland You're in the High Street now? Isn't it empty?
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 They were questions, bud, not proposals. When you've grown up, you might understand. Anyway, g'night.
@Peter_Kirkham @CharlieSnippy Hey, nutter right-wing ex-copper, are you following me....? Begone....
@WingsScotland @alistairjegray Actually, simply delete 'ultimately'.
@alistairjegray @WingsScotland Moreover, it's outcomes which count. You wouldn't know it from the obsession with process Scot debate..
@alistairjegray @WingsScotland Most of the costs and medical procedures are fixed before they get to Scotland. You must agree with that?
@alistairjegray @WingsScotland Pay levels and prof standards all ultimately decided in London. Drugs OK'd, in practice, by NICE in England.
@OneManWallopem hahaha!
@texas_ranger81 Hmmm, with a 12% rate of return? Why not try East Croydon - you'll get more for your money there and v good rail links.
@OneManWallopem No, Scottish fella was Egyptian and lives in Marbella but likes being a Sir and also hates the UK state....
@hjoneshojo Yeah, sarcasm to power.
@OneManWallopem THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE....
@eltel50 Ah, damn. Ok, you're in. I understand that Leeds-Halifax nexus is pretty hot these days….
@eltel50 Nah, you're out. I think I'd draw the line well south of you dodgy Leeds lot.
@hopisen Homage? Is that Catalonian for cheese?
@hjoneshojo Not me, buddy.
@hopisen And Catalonia. Them too.
@hopisen London and the SE would be a damn site richer than Calalonia.
@OneManWallopem No, folk just keep joining the army.
Maybe London and the South East should simply go independent and stop funding everyone else?
@OneManWallopem Nothing would change with Indy and everyone knows it. British Army will be just fine.
Let's get 2 really smart but obviously dotty old guys in a purple tent.With a frankly weird audience.In an abbey.Or something #bbcnewsnight
@johndickk_ @ukip2014 Yes, but we're debating whether the law is right or should be changed. That's the job of legislators.
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 That's circular, too.
@OneManWallopem Best policy.
@WingsScotland If NHS is truly, completely devolved as per 'No offer', the UK is finished. They'll definitely seek to renege.
@OneManWallopem Yeah, where you discover there's ANOTHER arsehole inside? One of the worst discoveries of mid-adulthood.
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 Look up what 'circular argument' means. Also, why this particular list?
@OneManWallopem All I hear is 'stop privatising the NHS'. Nothing about how amazing NHS care across UK is. Nothing about 'privatised' GPs.
@OneManWallopem Free at point of use,but more efficient in England. Bigger queues for elective in Scotland, but still v decent healthcare.
@WingsScotland Meaningful  - budgetary and professional - control over the NHS  in Scotland has never truly rested in Scotland.
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 So do my 12 year olds. They're super-smart. You can't answer the question, can you?If 16, why not 14 or 12? :-)
@UKIP2014 @johndickk_ It was for those minstrels. That's why they're history.
@jamiemcp Waste of money: misconceived as a way of buying prestige but the world doesn't care.
@OneManWallopem If ALL funding and decisions are devolved, then there's no NHS.
@wingsscotland Royal Colleges, unions, medical training, Nice - hardly any NHS is truly devolved at the moment.
@onemanwallopem Even if No wins, it's goodbye to NHS.
Just for fun, this, but I am right that Yes wants to break up British Army, NHS and the rest?
@johndickk_ @ukip2014 12 year old have kids, sadly.
@RLemkin Oh yes...!
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 Why 16 and not 14 or 12?
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 It's exactly the same, which is my point, How do you differentiate?
@KuKSoolian Haha! Good morning.
@johndickk_ @UKIP2014 "That know enough?"What kind of democratic test is that?
@KuKSoolian Can't help when reading tweets at altitude.
@RLemkin That's the choice.Renege and risk another referendum or legislate as promised and explode UK constitution (and get indy anyway).
@kuksoolian Get thae big, daft glasses aff yer heid. Daftie. An' cheerio.
@frownofcorns U r aware it was the SNP who brought the 1979 Labour govt down and ushered in Thatcher's?
@kuksoolian I think we both know, bud. Read the tweet.
@kuksoolian You didn't read my tweet properly, did you?
@johndickk_ @ukip2014 Hey, I'm still waiting for an answer to my question.If 16 year olds can vote, y not smart 12 year olds?As my kids say.
@kuksoolian 1997, 2001, 2005.
@kp2u Except Alex Salmond is First Minister and alive and well, whereas Thatcher left Downing St quarter of a century ago and is not.
@KuKSoolian Er, you missed 'for the last 20 or 30 years' out.
@johndickk_ @ukip2014 Why not a smart 12 year old, then?
@hjarta50 Me? I don't want the English?
@cammyk_67 Not bad, not bad…
Voter on C4 news - "I'm voting Yes because of Thatcher".
16yr old voter on why 'Yes': "In Scotland we've not a (UK) government we've voted for for 20 or 30 years". Er, u mean 4 years, son.
@randomvariable Thanks for this. I'll read in full. I guess I just don't see what's 'academic' about e.g. John Curtice's stuff.

@arranwhisky @roseleaarran @arranwhisky Depends how many folk you have sending abusive messages, I guess.
@lewmackenzie I really don't think ur reading my tweets at all. Ur not proposing a counter-argument, just shouting…
@lewmackenzie I don't think you've thought this through. You saying you shouldn't focus on the poor?
@euanmccolm That's a direct quote from Joyce McMillan, Ruth Wishart, et al?

#bbcnewsnight There had better be some drunk Tory farmers swearing outside the tent tomorrow in Galloway…
@emmalouisenicol hahaha!
Dr Stephen watson of 'Academics for Yes' giving authoritative economic commentary. He's a biologist. #bbcnewsnight
Quick, everyone, listen to Dundonians swearing on #bbcnewsnight
@elrick1 No. Unelected folk like you saw to that, bud. See you in obscurity shortly.
@prixpics @mrharrycole An independent Scotland run by a nationalist party? Sounds  faintly fascistic.
@elrick1 Mike, the drink's driven you mad. Let someone else take your Mum to vote, eh…and get some help. 'bye
@elrick1 Mike "I was slightly-importrant-behind-the-scenes once but then I drank too much and now I'm not" Elrick. All good fun,Barking boy.
@elrick1 Not actually, true, that, is it Mike? The drunk part. So, how's public affairs at Barking and Dagenham?
@sendmebackto @BBCNewsnight Same as ever.What about you?
@bbcnewsnight "We're going to attend to the loss of 40k of young people out of Scotland every year". Says London-dwelling Brian Cox.
@elrick1 Hey, Mike, be careful with that.With your personal record in Aberdeen, she might end up voting Yes.
@SeemaMalhotra1 @jennycolgan Well, they sort of might. But I see what she means...
Prime Minister, oddly, being asked a series of questions on @BBCNewsnight which media folk in Scotland have being asking for the last month.
@cairneypaul I would be honoured, indeed.
@CairneyPaul i was thinking of you as I wrote it! :-) So I'm only joking, obv!
@M4rtyman Nope. It should be free at the point of use, natch. But should we means test tuition fees? Nah, middle-class NUS says no.
@ChiaraAstrid Yes, in most cases they do.Learn about it.Listen to stream of @bbcradioulster from tomorrow at 0830.
@roseleaarran No, bud. When you send abusive messages, as you do, your standards are very low. Are all at @arranwhisky hateful as you?
"there's danger on the beaches of Thailand", says @BBCNews Hmmmm, cops are looking for a Brit......
@roseleaarran Your tweet to me was an insult.
@roseleaarran It's a joke.
"Hey,Professor of Politics,tell us what politics is really like"."Don't ask Me,bud.I've no idea.I've never been a politician & no-one cares"
@Alittl on very dodgy ground indeed saying 'what really are the odds?' on @BBCNews re: referendum. They're 1-4 and 11-2, bud.Why not report?
@roseleaarran And what do you know, whisky boy?
@melindiscott Jesus.But in other news,I really wish I knew where I could get to drive a racing car really fast,yet safely,around a track.
@roseleaarran Exactly.
@melindiscott It's light-hearted. It's a thing.
@leomiklasz @moh_kohn Yeah, the latter part is a worry. You're right.
@RealLabourVoice In last gen election, both SNP and Tories got in the 400,000s. So where does your comment leave SNP?
@leomiklasz @moh_kohn http://t.co/YQx9ctxgfS
@JohnnyCameo @moh_kohn @agentmancuso No, that latter bit requires a spot of means-testing.
Yes. This is true. THAT kind of universalism is good. THE OTHER kind is, you know, not so good....
@leomiklasz @moh_kohn Hahah!You cheeky man!Dissing Uncle Clem like that.His grandson is a LD peer & looks EXACTLY like him.Odd in corridors.
@ASairFecht If it's a Yes, we'll be on the same side. I'm sure of that, tbh. But I think it'll be a No. Until next time...
@moh_kohn Uh? Don't you think we should focus our welfare payments on, you know, poor people?
@ASairFecht I really think success of the SNP is based upon finally persuading middle folk SNP is on their side. Like?
@asairfecht Not to right of Tory govt, no. But I do think free fees/prescriptions is a very bad example of progressive measures.
@kinnell2 Perfectly coherent, honest Tory stuff. Folk free to choose if they agree or not. Free tuition/prescription is sleight of hand.
@leomiklasz @onemanwallopem I'm not saying liberals always wrong. Simply that you have to means test to spend on poorest.
@onemanwallopem @leomiklasz How do you target expenditure on the least well-off unless you test?
@onemanwallopem @leomiklasz Anyway, yer no nippin' ma buds.
@onemanwallopem @leomiklasz Best to read reply first?
@leomiklasz No, means testing is left-of-centre. It's how you tell who's poor and who to spend money on.
Note to 'Social Democrat' Yes voters. Giving things free to the better-off is a right-of-centre measure.
@verybritishdude Yeah. Unfairness isn't always bad.
@lennicholson Oddchecker  they're all there. I'm up for an accumulator.
@lennicholson Sure. But the comparison still stands.
@verybritishdude I will watch that in future…sounds like a top tip.
@zapcity911 @verybritishdude Yep,about that.Not really close at all. Much less, and most Scots (v's 'non-scots')will've voted Yes but lost.
@verybritishdude Maybe, but you'd think bookies would have counted that in?
@proleartthreat1 Blimey; sound easy to manipulate odds, then.
@james77277 Haha! If it's no there'll be another along in 5 years, so I might go for that accumulator….
@cammyk_67 And good luck with it….
@themoogs83 It wasn't me…
@proleartthreat1 No, I think the odds are prob about right. They're only odds, but commentators appear to be ignoring as it spoils story.
@cammyk_67 Sure, but the question still stands….
Wondering if footie commentators would say; 'too close to call' on match with odds of 1/4 vs 11/4?
@ashokahir @D_Blanchflower It's a kind of bureaumockracy, where the names of the parties make flag the pointlessness of the choice.
@d_blanchflower @ashokahir OK, so Swede Social Dems with 31% of vote will form govt with Moderates, Libs,  Centres. The acme of democracy?
@StrachanoG @YesWestLothian @brianmelliott Purdah doesn't apply by law to the ref. it's up to civil servants to decide on their own actions.
Why paying ransoms isn't always bad http://t.co/qRTGwdOUaK
@cjsnowdon I know. It's desperately sad.
@ukip2014 No. Most kidnappers have no idea. They're taking a chance and if they don't get money….
If you're asked for a ransom for a loved-one or employee - pay up http://t.co/qRTGwdOUaK
@D_Blanchflower @ashokahir Truly sweet you think there's an economic meta-narrative beneath the pointlessness which is Swedish politics.
@ashokahir @D_Blanchflower Wow! You mean the Social Democrats might beat the alliance of Moderates/Centre/Liberal/Democrat parties?Gripping.
Compelling and important Samantha Morton interview in @guardian http://t.co/jcD4xp3J2y
@Jgsteady @jhallwood Erm, that the SNP deliberately enabled both the Thatcher government and an increase in Tory representation in Scotland?
@mekquarrie @jhallwood Diverse? You mean, to only Tory constituencies?
@mekquarrie @jhallwood It was the active, historical choice; "Turkeys voting (Thatcher) for Xmas". As u must know, they were Tartan Tories.
@mekquarrie @jhallwood You're embarrassed by it, aren't you? Why not simply say shame and past now? You'd prefer to defend Tartan Tories?
@inverdiv @leomiklasz @jhallwood So you agree SNP intentionally helped Thatcher into govt because they hated Labour more?
@leomiklasz @jhallwood Go on, why would't they want to shout it from rooftops?
@MekQuarrie @jhallwood Ian, in Perth, Douglas Crawford's message was classical Tartan Tory. Poor Letham dwellers...
@Iain_33 @jhallwood The SNP made an active decision to help Thatcher into government. They correctly calculated they'd pick up Scot Tories.
@leomiklasz @jhallwood Surely Labour/PFI is an accepted part of historical political landscape?SNP a bit shy re: helping Thatcher into govt.
“@jhallwood: SNP 1979 election -Thatcher got elected- 22 Scottish Tory MPs damaged ALL UK. Not just Scotland. http://t.co/egfP7KYtqU” Uh oh.
@magsnews @houseoftwitslab @keeleymp @debbie_abrahams :-)
@MagsNews @HouseofTwitsLab @KeeleyMP @Debbie_abrahams Are the two blokes in front 'the vulnerable?
The Green Party (man on right) across the UK embraces nationalism. http://t.co/0KuIY3iHhI Er, have they thought that one through?
Guardian has Steenkamp as; 'woman who died after being shot by Pistorius'. Uh? 'Woman Pistorius killed' better. Maybe?
@RiversJon @Wnicholasgomes Yeah, them too.
@pollykeaton @BBCNewsnight Here we are. People of the UK through the medium of knitting....http://t.co/zf6f7S5pOP
@RiversJon @Wnicholasgomes What about the SNP Councillors?
International Paralympic Committee on @bbcnewsnight "the balls in his court' re: Pistorius and next paralympics. Hey, IPC, just shut up.
@pollykeaton @BBCNewsnight Learn from Ken and his 'British Apron'! I'll be sending you an examination paper on Scotland by special delivery.
Aw, c'mon. @bbcnewsnight has gone for pure comedy. Ken Loach and Ekow Eshun. But it's great, b'cos they're talking about Scotland…..
@mark4thorne How? Surely it'll have the opposite effect?
@maggiefairy @bbcnewsnight Now I'm scared. The more I think about it, the more I think my account's been hacked…..
@wee162 @irvinewelsh So it's still dangerous, then?
@maggiefairy @BBCNewsnight OK, yeah. Unless I've said something contentious. In which case my Twitter account's been hacked....
Hey, Allegra Stratton, wear THAT (nice) COAT in Glasgow to cover ref next week, why don't you? @BBCNewsnight
@mark4thorne Yeah, some. Also best Tories and Labour folk headed south but SNP stayed home? Also, people lie to themselves?
@colinfawkes Sounds like business could explode.
@wee162 Except then I remembered Pilton is pretty much gentrified too......
@wee162 I suggested an English journalist friend visit Pilton last night to find @irvinewelsh 's Edinburgh. Leith's gentrified now, right?
@bbcnewsnight has been compelling viewing for, oh, at least a week or so now. Jonathan Powell deserves so much more public recognition.
@colinfawkes Zacly. It really is time we set up a spacious, wooden yet sort-of-on-lcoal-trend pub in Larbert.Plenty of space around station.
@Southsidegrrrl Why, thank you, ma'am. e
@mark4thorne I'm not sure about that. It's pretty sullying for proper, decent folk.
@colinfawkes Hahaha! You saw him too?
Barnardo's Scot bod says (self-aggrandising, pointlessly); 'we must learn lessons from Rotherham'.Yeah.Don't mouth 'the line' unthinkingly.
@wee162 I love that you said 'fair enough'. That's really my point. :-)
Witherspoon bloke is Neil out of The Young Ones. Amaaaazzzing.
@A2Mac @ASairFecht Ah, I see. I thought the 'us nasty nats' maybe gave a hint of your political grouping?
@wee162 Er, yeah, ok. Have you checked all the others?
@mark4thorne I imagine MoD jobs would be lost with a Yes. Odd that a single old soldier would want to break up the British Army….
@a2mac @asairfecht You're certainly the establishment now.
@moylesno1fan Yep. I know you would….
Oh, yeah, and parenthesis? What, about, it?
In Glasgow.If this referendum is a test of political engagement and civic responsibility, then whatever they vote, Scots will pass the exam.
@NIDOSNetwork Thanks. GB was magnificent. #turnupsavelives is pretty patronising and offensive to MPs who met constituents on a Friday.
Just watching @RichardEGrant 's pixelated penis is a super Sky Atlantic prog from Tokyo's 'lost in translation' hotel.He should try Glasgow.
Hey, @bbcnews (tv) where's Donald Sinden's 'Sir'? Ur subscript says he was knighted but the headline just says 'Don'. Pah.
Very sorry to hear of the death of Ian Paisley. Mark Durkan just made very fine tribute in HoC.
Gordon Brown quotes African man - "I cannot love my children as you do, because when I lose them it will destroy me".
Gordon Brown just made a literally brilliant speech on international development at HoC. I hope media takes a look.
Hard for Scots interested in int development to argue for separation in light of UK's world leadership. Gordon Brown is brilliant 2day.
@iain_33 Yeah, some Tories against but many did turn out earlier to ensure it got it's reading (needed 100 MPs).
Gordon Brown moving and powerful on Rwanda, speaking at Ho'c on Michael fellow Scot Moore's International Development Bill.
William Pooley and #bbcnewsnight flagging central Ebola point. Millions of people in the developing world die needlessly.
"Syria has been fighting terrorism for 30 years - except, you know, for that other stuff, admittedly" - Syrian spokeswoman. #bbcnewsnight
@frazsimo Damn. Do you think he's got at my Mum already? I'll find out Saturday and let you know.
Tangential to Scot referendum, this, I admit. But Henry Kissinger vs Shimon Peres - no weapons - who's your winner? #bbcnewsnight
@frazsimo 50% increase today alone. Who could deny it?
@frazsimo That's THREE votes (incl my own and poss my mother's). It's all looking very good indeed…
@gaffersagent Phew, timing's out. I got fed up having to wear neoprene all the time. Chaffed liked billy-o in the Summertime.
@gaffersagent When, exactly?
@gaffersagent I outran Alf Tupper, Tough of the Track, once. Then again, he was 68 by then. And a cartoon.
@gaffersagent Yeah, I met a bolivian pelota vasca player once. He said he was famous. In his shed.
@gaffersagent He needs bigger shorts, too.
@gaffersagent Wrong culture for buying success. Rooney needs to move to midfield, though.
@gaffersagent Just got official word from IPSA."MPs may not claim pornography on expenses as there is plenty available free".
@gaffersagent Too early to say. Certainly popular with Arsenal players.
@gaffersagent I'm still shocked to hear that there's nudie stuff in the cloud and on the interweb.
@gaffersagent I've checked the rules already. No I haven't.
@gaffersagent Yeah, and unless you've got someone willing to swear an affidavit to the contrary, I'm in the clear.
Charming John Hale interview on @c4news there.
@gaffersagent OR ANY OTHER PUBLICATION OF THAT SORT, OBVIOUSLY…
@PhantomPower14 @scottishlabour I'm pretty sure their members are in favour of the union.
@gaffersagent Being able to masturbate with both hands isn't technically cross-training.
@PhantomPower14 @scottishlabour Probably never used it, then. Is she a member?
@gaffersagent Vice-president. I, uh, understand someone's expressed interest in president already…
Velvet Underground guy interviewed telly has 'drone orchestra'. Wonder if he bombs Waziristan with it?
@phantompower14 @scottishlabour USDAW's a good union, though.
@forcesbiznet @allandssmith 'Some'. You reckon. I think; 'nearly all trials which don't involve rich white folk'….
@gaffersagent I think nationalism is a bit silly, but it's up to folk.
@phantompower14 @scottishlabour @scottishlabour It IS uncertain. The argument is about whether it's worth risk or not.
@bilbocroft Nah, I don't understand a word of it either. :-)
@forcesbiznet @allandssmith Around 16k people murdered each year in South Africar. Wonder if Pistorius trial typical re: resources/time?
@bilbocroft Of course you can. if you've found a new supplier since Silk Road got busted. Just keep the curtains shut.
@gaffersagent I don't want a relationship with a Moroccan guy, mind. Not even for his internal organs…
@forcesbiznet @allandssmith People might think she'd waiting for legal reaction of first judgement before making judgement on lower charge…
@gaffersagent I thought £9.60 was a bit steep, tbh. But it came with a transparent plastic cover so fair deal.
@gaffersagent Thanks for offer, but I'm planning to spend tonight on a wooden kitchen chair staring at a framed picture of Anne Kirkbride.
@gaffersagent Totally.  That Jon bloke was a nutter and a fantasist. He's a fictional UKIP MEP now.
@gaffersagent Yep, I agree.
Re: Pistorius, it S
seems perverse to hold back part of decision for next sitting. Decisions should come up front, followed by reasoning….
@bilbocroft Yeah, they forgot to mention the drug addicts. Do you think an independent Scotland would nationalise their land.
@beccarebec I do shifts….
@phantompower14 @scottishlabour Uh. Asking? Recommending? U really mean 'terrorising'?
@bilbocroft how would independence affect that?
@scottishlabour ffffffgg
@nickeardley @gwfitzpatrick so, g'night Nick. See nothing much going on for u at BBC. Back to Scotsman, maybe?
@mwoodpen 'Men (and also women) are abed but while they slumber the land under them waits.' And good taste. That's also good.
@nickeardley @janekbradley @indiaknight So Jane's a mate of yours? And that the Scotsman's a bit shit - 4 u a simple career stepping stone?
Very much liking @mwoodpen  and her v tastefully-chosen RTs....
@janekbradley @indiaknight @nickeardley So, Jane, anything you gotta say about JP and Scotsman being screwed by Ashley, do crack on. Arse.
@janekbradley @indiaknight @nickeardley I see journos being culled. Ashley's still in place. Journos and Editor to scared to report...
@janekbradley @indiaknight @nickeardley of 'coming' circulation increases? Does Scotsman ever mention Ashley Highfield's failure to deliver?
@janekbradley @indiaknight @nickeardley Why not report on Johnson Press (and Scotsman) yearly 10% circulation decline and CEO's claims...
@janekbradley @indiaknight @nickeardley "They have..."? Is that how it is at the Scotsman (28k readership, new editor every 10 mins...
@chazmacq You're fine on that. I will kill no children. I've sent you a DM.
@chazmacq 18th? Totes. We can talk about 0.7% of UK budget..:-)
@chazmacq Toooooo true.READ NO PAPERS!
@chazmacq How fantastic are you? We can't meet this Friday.....Seriously, what day's good for you? Friday's usually good for me...:-)
@ScarfLady5 @falkirkcouncil @DeborahJaneOrr And you're both Yes? Equally misguided....
@ScarfLady5 @falkirkcouncil @DeborahJaneOrr Do you know how mines work? Do you drive a car? Wear clothes? Have a telephone?
@chazmacq You're pretty determined though. Fancy a human chat?
@chazmacq Yeah? Well, OK. Fair enough. I am happy to blame my staff for that.....
@chazmacq Point 1. Your local MP is here to serve you. 2. Really. 3. Ignore the lobbyists and go directly to your MP.
@chazmacq It's just that my office is quite efficient and when people write to me they get a reply.
@chazmacq Didn't you receive a reply to your letter?
@chazmacq I don't belong to any party. FFS, do you read the papers or just send out letter written for you by PRs?
@ScarfLady5 @falkirkcouncil I think the science is clear. But, more, you and @DeborahJaneOrr messaged me last night right after each other.
@chazmacq And the notion that I'm killing children by meeting constituents is monstrous. But then, ur a banker, so u'll know all about that.
@chazmacq Yeah, but you're not very aware. You're basing your public utterances to me on a letter from a junior PR.
@chazmacq working on the issue you refer to.Why not meet me and chat rather than haranguing me (using someone else's cheap words) in public?
@chazmacq Last Friday, I attended and voted against the bedroom tax. I cancelled constituents in Falkirk. I spend everyday, literally...1of2
@chazmacq Is anyone threatening the 0.7 figure which Labour put in place and the Tories have honourably followed through on?
@chazmacq To quote you; "essentially, yes". Actually, ur guilty of moral blackmail, led by someone lazy at an NGO who sent you the words.No?
@chazmacq While your telling me how parliament works, could you let me know when I can see constituents without killing children?
@chazmacq For fun, though, I'm pretty sure I did something about banking when I did my MBA years ago. I'll see what I can remember....
@chazmacq Ah, yes. So, enough said then. Everyone knows about banks. Enough to tell you how many people you might be killing on a Friday.
@ScarfLady5 @falkirkcouncil Lissa, what do you think of our mining legacy in Falkirk?
@chazmacq Really? Is that how it works? Super. So, what is it you do for a living and can I give you a lecture on the process of it?
@chazmacq So if I don't up I'll basically be killing people? That's a downer....
@sherlockandpals No.
What exactly IS John Major's objective? It feels like a preparation for an 'I told you so' English nationalism'.
I have lurking worries about Santander as a high street bank still run by a family. Familial succession is no way to run a bank.#botin
How the @Independent works. 1. Take Mail Online story http://t.co/uIPsjR4Udg 2. Get new quotes. 3. Hey presto, 2moro's headline....
@daveb59 If you don't vote then don't complain, buddy.
@DaveB59 You sound like a UKIP voter. I guess that's why they have a Scottish MEP now.
@jruddy99 And here it is. Vicky Featherstone as 'white settler'...http://t.co/DGOZi4VhG6
#bbcnewsnight Featherstone spoke 4 majority of Scot artistic community. Vote Yes because 1."Change is good (sic)". 2.Er, a fresh start....
@DeborahJaneOrr I have 9 days. That should be enough.Have you got Giorgio M's number? No animals will be killed. No neoprene will be worn.
@DeborahJaneOrr Yeah, but I'm not looking for Lols here. I'M TRYING TO SAVE THE UNION THROUGH SONG.
The No camp should have Al Green accompany the various leaders. That might just do the trick.  http://t.co/qboe41oBe7
@foolisholly Ha! Fair enough and good luck…
@foolisholly U see there appear to be some self-defining English folk who will vote for Indy then move back to England. Bit cheeky….
@foolisholly Sure. But Scottish is a matter of self-definition. So if you want to be independent then why not describe yourself a Scot now?
Picture of the week, and of that child's life…http://t.co/duQfsb8n1M
@wsctb Right now a lot of Scots are on their third pint at the beerfest.They're not listening.Shortly b4 vote, the hangover will kick in….
@mrcynical Generally, campaigners say it's close to get supporters out. When they do opposite, it's usually for canvasser's morale…
@himagainmammy A Yes vote would preclude the poss of UK general election.
Final thought 4 unite. If Scots vote Yes, the English won't allow Scots to choose who negotiates for England.No more UK elections.
@chaz01br OK. So what's your point? You commented on my observation that AD and BT were contradicting each other.
@dab24156 @foolisholly @bingomouse75 I think you're confused about Yes' vision of Scottishness.
@WingsScotland Ah. I see. If those points are what Yes boils down to, expressed in that way, then you're going to lose.
@Chaz01br So Alistair's wrong then? My point is that it's either close or it isn't.
@dab24156 @foolisholly @bingomouse75 If 'welcome Englishmen' are the deciding variable, I'll quote your reasonableness…
@wingsscotland No. Because Tory plan is to wash hands and pretend is isn't independence. It's incoherent.
Confused about No campaign. Darling, correctly, says it's v close. 'BT' says poll figures wholly contradict their findings.
@wingsscotland No, you're wrong. Most English Tories are on your side.
'That' devo+ plan flags fundamental disagreement between Labour + Tories/LD. Devolution of all tax is basically independence.
@GuidoFawkes @iainmartin1 Both sides of what?
@foolisholly @bingomouse75 Then why don't you describe yourself as Scottish?
@brainpicker Jelly?
@mekquarrie Yeah, tbh, I'd go for the footie…
I have speech at HoC in support of UK-based international mining industry coming up at around 7.45pm
@nmc_yellow I think you know, buddy.
@nmc_yellow Grrr.
@himagainmammy There are many more problems than that. e.g. Legislation for short parliament…..
@mwarne Did you read my piece at all?
@mwarne No, least bad option. Mark my words if there's a Yes vote.
@mwarne An election for what, exactly?
@himagainmammy Scot MPs at W'minster would have nothing to do with negs.
@HimAgainMammy The negotiations would be between Scotgov and UK gov. I don't think Scots MPs of any colour could have a thing to do with it.
No UK election if Scots vote Yes http://t.co/Xt66oh2Ucz and http://t.co/BRL0rwyyMl
@melindiscott @PCollinsTimes I'll take both; handy for travelling to those trickier countries....

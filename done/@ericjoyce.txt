@ifanmj Without England, everyone else gets less. If Welsh are aggrieved about that, why not try independence? Anyway, g'night, bud. Fri Apr 24 23:44:48 BST 2015
@ifanmj It looks like Scotland, unlike Wales, wants to put its money where its mouth is. No? Fri Apr 24 23:42:24 BST 2015
@ifanmj Exactly. Plaid want more. It's a begging game. It's all that separates. Fri Apr 24 23:38:15 BST 2015
@ifanmj yeah, I imagine all the others want less for Wales….:-) Fri Apr 24 23:32:27 BST 2015
@ifanmj No they wouldn't. It's election time, bud. They think begging for extra might yield an extra seat. There's nothing beyond that. Fri Apr 24 23:30:20 BST 2015
@ifanmj Everyone knows what Plaid's policy is. That's where we started. Turn the Welsh into aggrieved beggars. Blame UK but ask for more. Fri Apr 24 23:21:33 BST 2015

@Jsoosty Oops, he it is   http://t.co/jDRXLRsnKW I'd hate for you miss it as it'll be the talk of Carron. Probably. Sat Apr 04 13:19:29 BST 2015
@Jsoosty Right hen, ye'd better check oot ma Valedictory (as they say in Carron). It mentions Carron (from 3.48). It's a gripping read. Sat Apr 04 13:18:33 BST 2015
@melindiscott @ASairFecht @jockflypuppy @WingsScotland @thegreenplace Yep. Journos already trying to nail who passed note to minister. Sat Apr 04 13:13:33 BST 2015
@Jsoosty This is all very healthy and super for your multicultural household. Sat Apr 04 13:12:04 BST 2015
@ASairFecht @jockflypuppy @WingsScotland @thegreenplace Ah! gotcha. Funny old thing, the meeja. Sat Apr 04 13:06:10 BST 2015
@ASairFecht @jockflypuppy @WingsScotland @thegreenplace I'll regret this, but 'MSM'? Sat Apr 04 13:03:56 BST 2015
@Jsoosty Is he actually from Carron? Sat Apr 04 13:02:28 BST 2015

@Jsoosty @newsmary Yes. And apparently a 'root' in Australian is not a root beer.. Sat Apr 04 12:49:49 BST 2015
@wingsscotland :-) I'll tell you what. Scot office v small. Should be easy to tell who gave note to minister in abuse of purdah. Sat Apr 04 12:42:01 BST 2015
@asairfecht @wingsscotland @thegreenplace There's a formal report written by a civil servant. That's a story, regardless of accuracy. Sat Apr 04 12:40:03 BST 2015
@thegreenplace @george_wallis @wingsscotland @asairfecht @chairmanboab Apparently it's Scotland Office h/t @kennyfarq Sat Apr 04 12:37:57 BST 2015

@wingsscotland @thegreenplace @asairfecht The Scotland office civil servant is. It's a bad gig, 'cos it'll be obv who it is. Sat Apr 04 12:33:30 BST 2015

@george_wallis @wingsscotland @asairfecht @chairmanboab No, the note's real so it's a fair story. Sat Apr 04 12:19:13 BST 2015
@wingsscotland @asairfecht said it,but the story's based on what the note says. Obviously a terrible breach of civil service 'purdah' rules. Sat Apr 04 12:15:42 BST 2015

@warrenfinn @labourcat I've never said that, bud. Can you show me where I have? No, because you've made it up. Mon Mar 30 22:17:47 BST 2015
@warrenfinn @labourcat Of course there was. But you agree GPs should take away flying licenses, yes? Mon Mar 30 20:56:43 BST 2015
@warrenfinn @labourcat I know people will avoid going to GP as consequence. But that's the way it is. Mon Mar 30 20:51:38 BST 2015
@warrenfinn @labourcat Let me be clear. A guy says to GP; "I'm deeply depressed and an airline pilot"? GP signs him off with CAA. Mon Mar 30 20:50:55 BST 2015

@JuliaHB1 @chrisdeerin exactly my thought. Sun Mar 29 22:56:45 BST 2015
@WarrenFinn Actually. It's all horrible and we should think about both the murders and folk who suffer from depression. Ur is fair comment. Sat Mar 28 22:03:21 GMT 2015
@WarrenFinn I'm sure that's true. But you think it's wrong for media to flag depression, mental illness and suggest a link? Sat Mar 28 21:46:57 GMT 2015
@warrenfinn Depression's in the mix. Most depressed folk don't kill, obv. But that doesn't make depression irrelevant. Sat Mar 28 21:02:45 GMT 2015

@onlytoff Yep. I'm totally up for that. So why do you say you live in Stirling? Mon Feb 16 21:29:35 GMT 2015
@welshtoy No. They're rubbish. With their moving glasses and hand-holding and going 'woo'. Mon Feb 16 21:29:03 GMT 2015
@onlytoff Bud, it's a waste of everyone's time preaching to the converted. Life's too short. Mon Feb 16 21:28:05 GMT 2015
@onlytoff Then why not read the links in my post? And, as always, anti-frackers never give a toss about the jobs at risk. Mon Feb 16 21:22:57 GMT 2015
@welshtoy Symbolism. Mon Feb 16 21:22:03 GMT 2015
@onlytoff Why does your self-described location say Stirling? Mon Feb 16 21:21:26 GMT 2015

@harrydownes69 Why not ask Falkirk Food Bank, which you clearly know little about, how many use it, rather than making snide comments to me Sat Feb 14 23:10:13 GMT 2015
@harrydownes69 I know this because my office works with it, as opposed to doing nothing as you seem to think. Sat Feb 14 22:57:55 GMT 2015

@harrydownes69 So you're just repeating it without thought? 25000 in my constituency? Sat Feb 14 18:08:25 GMT 2015
@HarryDownes69 btw, there are around 130000 folk in Falkirk constituency. U reckon over 25000 fed by foodbanks? Sat Feb 14 16:59:32 GMT 2015

@emmersonslaw Kaboom! Tue Feb 03 12:58:26 GMT 2015
“@MailOnline: Scientists discover organism that hasn't evolved for over 2 billion years http://t.co/6NapWycp37” Enter nominated joke here… Tue Feb 03 12:40:19 GMT 2015
@paulwaugh It'd be perfectly consistent with Chancellor's position on tax havens. It's Stuart Rose who's off-beam. Tue Feb 03 11:26:14 GMT 2015
Gallantry and killing. http://t.co/O4JPBFl6ec Tue Feb 03 11:19:16 GMT 2015
@davidshipleysca and, btw, I'm an independent MP. If a tax-exile rich bloke feels menaced, God help him in business. Tue Feb 03 10:57:18 GMT 2015
@davidshipleysca Nope, just the way the market works. Ask a few institutional shareholders for their view. Tue Feb 03 10:56:15 GMT 2015
@davidshipleysca The point of Monaco is that it's a tax-avoidance state. And he can comment if he likes. He'll hurt his shareholders, tho. Tue Feb 03 10:37:41 GMT 2015

@davidshipleysca Tax exile getting involved in UK election while running company for UK shareholders? Not super. Tue Feb 03 09:41:21 GMT 2015
@timfarron @huffpostukpol Right, you've asked for it. I'm going to blog! Tue Feb 03 09:36:38 GMT 2015
@timfarron @huffpostukpol You want the Iraq war to dominate the election in 2015? Have you nothing to offer now? Tue Feb 03 09:31:30 GMT 2015
@davidshipleysca Of course they are, that's the point. It's a two way dialogue, right? Or should we listen in reverence? Tue Feb 03 09:17:06 GMT 2015
Tory Lord Rose says unfair to criticise businessfolk making party-political statements at election time'. Odd kind of democracy he wants. Tue Feb 03 09:09:30 GMT 2015
@lawyerzeus Hmmm. That may suggest there are too many graduates for the economy. Mon Feb 02 20:15:04 GMT 2015
@roballan4 Daily Record has a paywall; the definition of hopeless optimism, really. So can't see crap piece. Mon Feb 02 19:54:41 GMT 2015
@cuthbertneil Maybe. It isn't a brand per se as far as employers are concerned, though. Many middle-class folk know this. Mon Feb 02 19:52:29 GMT 2015
Why many people earn LESS because they attend university http://t.co/o5CJBQY6BK Mon Feb 02 19:33:04 GMT 2015

@johnrentoul Thanks. And, suppose it does? Blimey! Mon Feb 02 08:58:38 GMT 2015

@alkanomega Well, there's only 3 points in it at the moment…. Sun Feb 01 22:37:54 GMT 2015
@jsoosty with added sectarianism. Sun Feb 01 22:28:34 GMT 2015
Celtic beat Rangers 2-0. Big story in Scotland. Meanwhile, 30 years since any other team won Scottish premiership. #excitingscottishfootball Sun Feb 01 22:21:59 GMT 2015
@stephenkb Thanks, Stephen. Sun Feb 01 22:06:14 GMT 2015
If the Greeks can renegotiate with EU re: vast debt extending from tax-evasion, maybe UK can renegotiate a few things too? Sun Feb 01 20:59:14 GMT 2015

@BenThomWood I’m surprised you’re surprised that a politician should pass comment/judgement on an opponent. Holding him to account.
@BenThomWood I can’t think of anything more constructive than trying to prevent EdM and EdB from getting anywhere near government. ;-)

@paulwaugh I have visions of Centrica paying the Mail to write attack articles. Barclays blackmailing Labour MPs to brief against EdM. Mad
@paulwaugh consider what he’s actually saying & ask “who?” &it becomes ludicrous. Which banks? Which energy companies? What are they doing?
@frances_cutler it will be.
@frances_cutler I’m strongly against hs2 and voted against it. But I don’t lose sleep over the ‘campaign for hs2’ lot.
@frances_cutler no evidence it was and no real reason to believe it was. In my view pretty unlikely.
@frances_cutler I’ve no idea, but there is no evidence it was a party campaign. In fact it attacked conservatives along the route
@montie that’s an unclear article. Was it voted most ‘valuable’ or most ‘significant’. The two are not necessarily the same.
@frances_cutler nice attempt at misdirection from McDonnell but I’m not interested. If u think this is remotely equivalent then shame on you
@frances_cutler that was a terrible campaign (not run by Conservative Party), but still doesn’t even come close to this. Not by a mile.
@justbeinganicon @graham_st very true
is that your only comment @GloriaDePiero ? You don’t condemn what he said?
EdM:“I’ll tell you what Together means friends.Together means a predistributed onenation zero-zero economy with no predators,only producers”
@graham_st @justbeinganicon :-)
@RebeccaLSwift I agree. Made all the worse for his pseudo intellectual analysis. Literally condoning non-consensual sex. Literally.
First McDonnell http://t.co/kWj31MONzd then Livingstone http://t.co/NETEuk8iog - once they lose Party discipline their nastiness breaks thru
Is EdM honestly launching his umpteenth comeback by declaring himself the Zero-Zero Politician? Does he have any competent advisors at all?
Labour the nasty party - laughing at jokes about murdering female MPs and killing the royal family. Get a grip EdM: http://t.co/kWj31MONzd
@RebeccaLSwift it’s unbelievable. He tries to cover it by mocking 1970s judges...then basically says exactly the same thing they did.

@jamesoflynn perhaps not! But then we’re all just people. Take care.
@jamesoflynn up to a point. But I suspect a bit of mocking the other side (from all politicians) is expected and built into expectations.
@jamesoflynn yes there’s some of that going on. Conservatives want Cons-UKIP waverers to make a choice between EdM & DC. Lab just desperate!
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge (which he doesn’t make difficult! Lol). Because it makes it harder to people to see him as a potential PM.
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge that’s true. But when memes are grounded in truth they do stick. It helps the Conservatives for EdM to be mocked.
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge so in a sense it shores up the views of those who already agree with you.
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge that’s true but only up to a point. I think they don’t like it against their own side, but do against the other side
@AndyCavster @kv654321 @NaraHodge ah, because EdM & EdB would never play the man...or his school. EDM wants to be PM. Scrutiny
@NaraHodge ;-)
@kv654321 @NaraHodge we don’t fear him. We mock him. More worrying for him, so do his own MPs.
@JFKKPOD thanks. Apologies for being a bit sharp.
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge Lord knows he tries to dish it to ‘Tory toffs’ when he can. Granted, like most things he does, not very successfully
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge this man wants to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I think he should be able to cope with a bit of stick.
@kv654321 @NaraHodge lol. Yes, that’s all we can say about EdM. In all other respects he is a towering political figure. ;-)

@JFKKPOD I’m afraid we can’t work miracles. I’ll have a look, but we can only work as fast as the Govt dept we’re chasing
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge it will be interesting to see. We’re in fairly uncharted waters.
@jamesoflynn @NaraHodge I’m sure you’re right. I’m sure the reason EdM is polling below even Nick Clegg is because of the nasty bigger boys

@AllieRenison its the YouGov GE poll for the Sun.
Labour’s approach to EVEL is effectively “we don’t like the way English voters might vote on English laws so we’ll block them from doing so”
To be fair, as some have noted its a small subsection of a national poll so high MOE. Still worrying to Labour though.
@CllrBobCopland well we don’t know that, so without knowing the outcome of renegotiation talks its a hypothetical I can’t answer.
Latest YouGov poll has Labour behind the Conservatives in Scotland. When is the last time that happened?

@Iain_33 not ordered. Asked.
@zimbot I don’t follow you?
@zimbot well, many of us (in all parties) disagree with you. http://t.co/DYhKhfqijY
@CllrBobCopland have to disagree with you there.
@zimbot It can be done & was discussed in chamber today, but we won’t resolve this today on Twitter. (Hence we need cross sorry talks!) ;-)
@zimbot Resolving this doesn’t require regionalisation - a policy specifically rejected by the electorate when they were asked.
@zimbot well, that’s the point of cross party talks. To discuss exactly that. Labour not even prepared to discuss it.
@woolyhat2000 @jameskirkup deputy speaker announced as a Brown rise to speak that she would allow him to speak then impose a time limit.
@zimbot if that is your only concern, why has your party refused to join cross party talks on how to implement it?
@geoffjellis @pauluppalmp in what way?
@zimbot then why describe equalising the situation as ‘dividing things up’? Ppl of Atherstone have less voter power than Scottish voters
Good point made by Sir George Young. We don’t currently have two classes of MP. We have two classes of constituents & voters.
@zimbot New Labour already did that. They opened this can of worm but failed to resolve the key details.
@zimbot you don’t seem to understand that we are taking about equalising things between Scottish and English MPs. Not dividing anything.
@zimbot Clear examples of the West Lothian Question. Major pieces of legislation not affecting Scotland but pushed through with scot votes
@tomasth89 I reformed the HoL. That’s probably enough for now. ;-)
@LouiseMensch @Budhistrider I agree Louise. The answer to the West Lothian Q isn’t dismembering England.
@drdavidmonty @jameskirkup I’m afraid you’re wrong. He had no time limit. Spoke for around 25 mins or so.
In the Scottish devolution debate. Two tier MPs? Gordon Brown has unlimited speaking time, other backbenchers limited to 6 minutes.
@zimbot ...even though neither policy even applied in Scotland. Without the Scottish MPs voting for them, they would not have passed.
@zimbot for example when Labour brought in tuition fees & foundation hospitals in England, they relied on Scottish MPs’ votes, even though..
@zimbot it’s about more than grant levels. It’s about policies & accountability. We currently have 2-tier MPs. Unfair to English voters.
@Re1axinmood I agree. At the moment we have one rule for Scottish MPs and another for the rest.
@zimbot why is that a required price? Scottish MPs can vote on education in my constituency - not affecting theirs! I can’t vote on theirs
@zimbot well, point of cross party talks is to agree the details. But right now we have 2 tier MPs in way that isn’t fair to English voters

So EdM literally 'forgot' to mention the deficit in his speech? After all its a minor detail. He's probably a bit bored of thinking about it
Lol > RT @MrHarryCole: "it's like everything dan hodges has ever written coming true" overheard in press room re Ed speech.
@BenThomWood @James_BG all 'unabated' fossil fuels, but that cannot be wished into happening. Start with coal & stop obsessing about shale
@JFKKPOD we're an active, busy office. Staff often out visiting constituents. Best to email details: dan.byles.mp@parliament.uk
@Re1axinmood it will be a long way there by then anyway, yes. Also, first labour set up the Low Pay Commission to set the rate independently
EdM pledges higher min wage. Not next year or year after. Or year after that, year after that, or year after that. But the year after that
@JohnRConstable @feralbritain there's an argument for that. Also for an English Grand Committee (which doesn't create yet more politicians)
@JohnRConstable @feralbritain why would being unionist stop someone supporting a politically coherent England? A stable union requires it
@JohnRConstable @feralbritain that doesn't make sense??

Lol > RT @Samfr: I like that 25% of people said "don't know" when asked if Ed Miliband is decisive.  http://t.co/8NvEFPFr0p
@mickeyhynes perfect!! Enjoy. :-)
@Mundo311 we'll see. But no backsliding from DC that I've seen.
@mickeyhynes I agree - we won't agree on this! Enjoy your lunch. Hope you have some Yorkshires? :-)
@mickeyhynes @beth_duffus @faisalislam how would that differ from current situation between UK Govt and Scotland?
@Mundo311 timetable wasn't part of the 'vow', but it's here: http://t.co/S1jFpP5iVp
@mickeyhynes our system was never really 'designed'. Evolves. Flaw left over from 1997 devolution - this is will help fix that flaw.
@mickeyhynes no more than the UK government currently "can't govern" Scotland.
@beth_duffus and most of them don't seem to object
@mickeyhynes @AyeRightNaw @faisalislam not the point. Decided by UK Parliament, and under Parliament's jurisdiction.
@R_McCormack people didn't keep quiet about this. It may not have been #1 issue, but the WLQ has definitely been discussed since 1997/8
@AyeRightNaw @faisalislam I've specifically said regional agenda is wrong. The answer to this isn't dismembering England. It's empowering it
@R_McCormack very few people ever raise PR. more raise Englishness and lack of attention paid to the English over last 10+ years
@Mundo311 heavens, I hope not! Disagree about DC back pedalling. Sticking to timetable.
@R_McCormack I disagree.
@AyeRightNaw @faisalislam @mickeyhynes understand fully. They can vote on English education. I can't vote on Scottish. Two tier MPs already
@R_McCormack EVEL is basic democracy. It's not party political.
@mickeyhynes they can vote on my constituency but I can't vote on theirs. That's not facetious. It's a two tier system.
@AyeRightNaw @faisalislam @mickeyhynes if you can't see the difference then you're not looking with open eyes.
@Mundo311 what makes you say that? What has been ditched?
@R_McCormack don't try to conflate too many issues together. You're not going to solve everything with one big-bang change. EVEL is simple.
@mickeyhynes @faisalislam ours has two tier members. Now. Glasgow MPs can vote on education in my constituency, I can't vote on it in theirs
@R_McCormack but there no need to completely dismantle the current constitution. There is a simpler solution - grand committee.
@R_McCormack I don't see the need (or the clamour) for more politicians. English/Welsh 'grand committee' would solve the issue neatly.
@feralbritain Why should the answer to this be dismembering England into regions? Overwhelmingly rejected already: 
http://t.co/OKDy2TJmMP
So EdM plans to "free-up councils from planning regulations" & build 200,000 houses a year. Greenbelt under threat.

...so lets hope it flies! ;-)

@MBRoberts4004 exactly. And why does England have to be dismembered to answer the WLQ? Why not empowered at the nation level?
And so it starts. For Labour & EdM, in response to Scotland vote, they want England to be dismembered into 'regions'
http://t.co/A2i4rv7fIA
Salmond quits as SNP leader. Didn't see that coming. I thought he'd stay to lead negotiations over devomax.
Now watch Labour try to use the #indyref to resurrect their failed regionalisation agenda - http://t.co/IkXCgixS64 - rather than address WLQ
EdM & Labour still don't get it. Brown promised earth to Scotland, now they're pouring cold water on talk of a fairer settlement for England
One lesson from the Indyref - EdM has poor cut through even with Labour voters. It took Gordon Brown of all people to unite Labour base
@janemcqueen I don't think it will go well for Labour if they try to shortchange English voters
That means we now need a fair deal for England, and a (long overdue) resolution to the West Lothian Question.
Delighted and relieved that cool heads prevailed in Scotland. The UK remains intact. Now we need a balanced constitutional settlement

@Djohn1977 nor did the referenda for elected city mayors catch the imagination. There just isn't the support.
@Djohn1977 the experience of devolving policing to Police & Crime Commissioners hasn't set local politics alight either!
@Djohn1977 not sure there's any evidence for that. I get lots of letters about English parliament. None about regional powers.
@Djohn1977 but there's very little support for another regional tier of govt: http://t.co/gpgjR4XjmL
Very well attended inaugural meeting of the All Party Smart Cities Group today. A fascinating subject. This will be an interesting APPG.
@ShoothillRod interesting. Yes, this looks useful.

http://t.co/iBjHXvkEw4
@actuary21c @civicathiest ;-)
@Outoftweet123 @frances_cutler I think it's the wrong policy, but I don't believe there's any conspiracy. Just poor decision making.
@civicathiest @actuary21c or Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion!
@civicathiest @actuary21c all that would happen is, millions of ppl would be criminalised and the religion would go underground
@civicathiest @actuary21c how would a ban work? Arrest people outside the mosques? Confiscate the mosques and demolish them?
@civicathiest @actuary21c I broadly agree with this. You can't legislate to change what ppl believe is directed by god. Simply not practical
@actuary21c not at all. You said wouldn't affect CofE, that's all.
@actuary21c gay clergy in CofE? If you want this for all religions I come back to my initial point - you were only attacking Islam.
@actuary21c why only Islam? Why wouldn't this forced equality law not apply to all religions?
@Outoftweet123 @frances_cutler @Conservatives Then he should have voted against it, like I did. I don't support it, but no vested conspiracy
@actuary21c I think we are just on completely different pages here about what the state can and can't do. We won't convince each other.
@actuary21c religion doesn't belong to the state to reform. The alternative is tyranny. You can't legislate for religious belief.
@actuary21c i said some (many?) prob would. But many wouldn't. There aren't just 2 groups and 2 options. This is a kaleidoscope.
@actuary21c mmm...lets not get too involved in this again! But some brief responses...
@smotyndu indeed!
@Outoftweet123 @frances_cutler what a load of rubbish he wrote. I voted against hs2. He could have too. He also stood as a conservative.
@caddymation lol. True.
@frances_cutler I genuinely doubt anyone else will. We have the strongest European policy (with the referendum edge) of the main parties.
@caddymation no, I think he was pretty much on the way out and it was a last gasp bit of rebellion.
@tomasth89 perhaps that's why later defectees didn't rush to emulate him!
Interesting thought - is #Carswell setting precedent by resigning & fighting a by-election, that will be hard for future defectors to avoid?
Very disappointed that D Carswell has defected & resigned. Wrong decision.
@caddymation technically Bob Spink was the first ukip MP. http://t.co/MFYZlJCK8P
@MrHarryCole apparently he will. Some to kudos to him for that.
@glasterlaw1 aha - I missed that. Thanks.
@MrHarryCole so - given his desire for voter choice in these matters (ie recall), will he resign and fight a by-election?
@glasterlaw1 not if he has resigned the whip. No rules say there has to be a by election unfortunately.
@IainMcGill they had Bob Spink. http://t.co/MFYZlJCK8P
@MrHarryCole ironically, based on their MEP record, any future UKIP MP likely to be first to be recalled!
@PickardJE no - Bob Spink was. Briefly.
Douglas Carswell defects to ukip > RT @MrHarryCole: Carswell defects

@OwenJones84 you're an established fringe figure. ;-)
@actuary21c @YYYPRRS1 @Viscous_Shear good night all.
@actuary21c @YYYPRRS1 @Viscous_Shear no one is going about daily business as usual. We just don't all share your view of the solution.
@danielbyles @actuary21c @Viscous_Shear anyway, it's late and I have an early start. We won't resolve this tonight!
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear I understand that POV, but right now the real issue is that actual laws were broken but nothing was done about it
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear understood.
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear those exemptions were put in by fair minded people to balance equality with freedom of association. Not simple.
@actuary21c I disagree. I could say your arguments about religion could have been used by Stalin but that would be just as cheap.
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear no, you said: "we give Islam (& Catholicism) freedom to break the law at the moment" about 28 mins ago
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear exactly - law does not cover this. So they are not 'breaking' the law as you previously stated.
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c for some that is true. And if they break the law of the land they should be punished the same as anyone else.
@actuary21c @Freedworld I am an atheist and I am not standing for re-election next year. I am a conservative so I believe in freedom.
@RealWitan @actuary21c @viscous_shear possibly, but I don't believe they are correct. Just as I can't sue the PM for only promoting women!
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear I know she can't. But it is not against the law as you suggested. Same with gay priests. Law doesn't cover it
@emmersonslaw thanks. Glad we can agree on this one.
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c I don't agree with them, but they are not against our laws and never were. You two misunderstand the law.
@actuary21c @Ath_Bob or go and form your own club with your own rules, as some churches did over women and gay priests.
@actuary21c @Ath_Bob for the same reasons we 'allowed' bans on women priests and bishops. It's a club. Don't joint it if you don't like it
@Ath_Bob @actuary21c no it isn't.
@actuary21c @Ath_Bob I don't like it. I don't like a lot of things done in the name of religion. But I'm obviously more libertarian than you
@danielbyles @actuary21c @Viscous_Shear ...and all women shortlists for political parties.
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear but things like that aren't covered by the law, so there is no 'exemption'. Just as you can have all male clubs
@actuary21c it's also a red herring. The problem in Rotherham is that actual laws were being broken and police, cllrs etc did nothing
@actuary21c and many do. But a change like that has no meaning unless it comes from within, and I don't believe in State trying to impose.
@actuary21c @Viscous_Shear how do we give them the freedom the break the law?
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c you've answered your own question. That shouldn't have happened and must be stamped out everywhere.
@actuary21c ...I'm saying target the criminals (with no special pleading for religion or culture), not the religion itself.
@actuary21c of course, that's a silly point. But you have admitted majority of UK Muslims don't break the law. Yet you're targeting them all
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c I agree - and that is exactly the point I am making. Punish people for breaking the law, not for being Muslim
@actuary21c ...what that doesn't mean is that you are free to break the law as a result of your beliefs. That's the difference.
@actuary21c it does happen here. Just on a smaller scale and the HIV risk is lower. But freedom of religion is a tenet of free a society
@actuary21c of course we must stop this. But you're tilting at the wrong windmill. Go after the criminals without fear or favour.
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c no religion should get special treatment. Secular law is extremely important.
@actuary21c I never went into politics thinking the State can control everything or wave a legislative magic wand to resolve problems, no.
@actuary21c ...and catholic preaching on condoms leads to thousands of avoidable deaths in Africa, but Govts don't try to impose change
@actuary21c but they did it themselves and it took a long time and a lot of handwringing. Govt didn't interfere.
@actuary21c are you for real? Parliament should try to pass a law changing a religion? No way that can or would happen. Not a dictatorship
@Viscous_Shear @actuary21c there is a New Testament verse that said none of the Old Testament laws should change too.
@actuary21c there are plenty of moderate Muslims pushing for reform. But the State can't impose reform like that.
@actuary21c and even the woolly old CoE gets in a twist over female priests and bishops. You're tilting at the wrong windmill.
@actuary21c and yes, your reforms would probably be welcomed by many Muslims, but the State can't impose religious reform.
@danielbyles and even the woolly old CoE gets in a twist over female priests and bishops. You're tilting at the wrong windmill.
@danielbyles and yes, your reforms would probably be welcomed by many Muslims, but the State can't impose religious reform.
@actuary21c ...of course that failed to happen in Rotherham. That is the entire point. Not banning an entire religion!
@actuary21c you continue to completely misunderstand what I said at the start of this exchange.
@actuary21c ...fire, or bring criminal charges if appropriate, those who turned a blind eye and failed to protect. Police, cllrs, social wks
@actuary21c ...Prosecute FGM cases. Prosecute sexual abuse, grooming, rape regardless of the religion of the perpetrators...
@actuary21c enforce the law and punish crime without pussyfooting around or making excuses because of someone's colour or religion...
@actuary21c you appear to want to target the majority, who have done nothing, rather than target the criminals who have actually done this.
@actuary21c what reform would you demand? Vast majority of UK Muslims practice religion peacefully. You're going after the wrong people.
@actuary21c no they're not. But they are no worse than most of the Old Testament
@actuary21c are the majority of British Muslims? Instead of targeting the actual problem you want to ban all Islam in UK. Bonkers.
@actuary21c doesn't mean most Muslim would advocate that today. Most Christians believe in a god who advocated slavery, genocide and rape.
@actuary21c and bears no resemblance to the religion practiced by the vast majority of British Muslims.
@actuary21c I believe there are some psychopathic lunatic fundamentalists who need to be stopped, yes. I disagree that is the 'common' view
@mattydug quite possibly. I would need to check the figures.
@FezzieMac for not agreeing that the answer is to ban Islam? Ok.
@actuary21c most Catholics don't abuse children but lots of catholic priests have. Should we ban Catholicism?
@actuary21c these people didn't do this to 'emulate Mohamed'. They did it because they are sick paedophiles who kept getting away with it.
@actuary21c do they? Do you know any Muslims? Have you met any personally? None of the Muslims I know do.
@danielbyles @actuary21c I have Muslim friends who have never committed any crimes. Banning their religion over this would be bonkers
@actuary21c some Muslim men did this and culture/religion was a factor. But effectively blaming all Muslims and banning Islam is nuts...
@actuary21c and all I did was point out that your tweets were starting to stray into the territory of being generally anti-Muslim.
@actuary21c because we both know the answer & it is not directly relevant. Supposedly betrothed at 6 & consummated at 9, although disputed
@actuary21c absolutely they are, and we should arm the Kurds in Iraq. But we haven't discussed that at all. We were discussing Rotherham.
@actuary21c beyond that I actually wasn't very critical. I said I understood the point you were trying to make.
@actuary21c I pointed out that you drifted from the issues in Rotherham, where religion clearly a factor, to a generic trashing of all Islam
@actuary21c you have a very simplistic position on a complex issue. I'm not really interested in trying to engage you in a twitter debate.
@actuary21c banning Islam isn't going to happen and isn't a credible suggestion. I don't have a neat answer for you in 140 characters.
@actuary21c ...clearly are not understanding my point, but I don't intend to discuss it all evening. I understand what you're trying to say
@actuary21c I used to live in Saudi Arabia. I have a very good understanding of this. I understand the link in Rotherham. You clearly...
@actuary21c and I know its not what you meant. But your tweets were starting to sound quite generically anti-Muslim. Hence my gentle tweet
@actuary21c I am not & I understand that point. But your tweets are crossing over into a general, wider attack on (sounds like all) Muslims.
@actuary21c I haven't said don't criticise Islam. But you are acting like this was done by the entire Muslim community. It wasn't.
@actuary21c you need to tone down the anti-Muslim rhetoric. These crimes were horrific, but they were carried out by people.
@greennuneaton entirely agree about energy efficiency - and proper demand side response. Simply not realistic to stop using gas quickly tho
@JAFF3 yes, you are right. I was speaking loosely. Currently a moratorium on fracking but not on mining lignite. Senseless.
@JAFF3 there's currently a moratorium.
*Facepalm* > RT @craigawoodhouse: Amazingly, this is how the Rotherham report is listed on the council website. http://t.co/XMvgZohEPO
@greennuneaton I do, as long as the sites appropriate. I support a balanced energy mix, with growing renewables and gas replacing old coal.
@JohnMannMP it is beyond parody!
@greennuneaton global coal use is rising, and yet activists waste their efforts fighting gas. It is not rational.
Germany does not allow fracking, and yet they could displace 6,000+ people for an opencast lignite mine. Absurd. http://t.co/Yglck8frPo

One resignation in #rotherham. No one fired. What about the council portfolio holders and officers responsible for safeguarding?
@emmersonslaw this took place between 1997 & 2013. Has nothing to do with cuts. Don't try to use this for political agenda.

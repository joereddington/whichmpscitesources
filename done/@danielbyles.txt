@connaismith @FraserNelson yes, that is the worry. Not trickle down. People paying taxes directly who, if they leave, they won’t any more. Mon Apr 27 16:33:23 BST 2015
@connaismith @FraserNelson those 115,000 non-doms pay as much tax as 10 million lower income taxpayers. Losing that would hurt. Mon Apr 27 14:35:37 BST 2015
@connaismith @FraserNelson no that’s not the argument. The argument is that the 115,000 non-doms pay £8.2bn in direct taxes. No trickle down Mon Apr 27 14:34:00 BST 2015
@connaismith @FraserNelson no such thing. ;-) Mon Apr 27 14:29:03 BST 2015
@connaismith @FraserNelson not deflecting. Noting there has been long standing consensus that the benefits outweigh the costs. Mon Apr 27 14:16:11 BST 2015

@strolltoitaly mmm...sounded like she was talking about borrowing to fund departmental spending. Sun Mar 29 12:02:34 BST 2015
@welshboy82 @CCHQPress but she appears to be talking about borrowing to fund departmental spending. Sun Mar 29 12:01:13 BST 2015
@CCHQPress “borrow to bring the deficit down”. Isn’t that an oxymoron? Sun Mar 29 11:25:37 BST 2015
@paulwaugh that’s incredibly unfair. Surely it is basic courtesy to Her Majesty, and a deep seated part of our tradition. Way more than PR! Sun Mar 29 10:04:34 BST 2015

@JCmacc1 I think expectations for EdM were so low he just had to turn up and not fall over So people pleasantly surprised when he didn’t! Fri Mar 27 11:04:45 GMT 2015
@JCmacc1 that in the run up to an election, one candidate outperforming another by 8% is significant. You’re perfectly free to disagree. Fri Mar 27 10:18:33 GMT 2015
@JCmacc1 of course it doesn’t. No one said it does. If you’re happy with the results then that’s lovely for you. We’re all happy. :-) Fri Mar 27 10:13:36 GMT 2015
BBC #radio4 headline also said PM won by a ‘margin’ of 54%! Get a grip BBC. Embarrassing. Fri Mar 27 10:05:52 GMT 2015
10am BBC #radio4 news headline still quoting a statistically insignificant (and meaningless) poll subset. Very poor journalism. Fri Mar 27 10:03:59 GMT 2015
@JCmacc1 yes, an 8% lead in election terms is “hands down”. And switching figure is statistically insignificant subset of 80. Meaningless. Fri Mar 27 09:53:04 GMT 2015
Why did @BBCr4today headline in 9am news a statistically insignificant poll subsample of 80. Don’t they understand polling? Very naughty BBC Fri Mar 27 09:17:15 GMT 2015
At least twice #BBCtoday have said “neither was clear winner” re DC & EdM Paxo interviews when the polls show DC won hands down. Naughty BBC Fri Mar 27 08:36:51 GMT 2015

@Sarahcdownes absolutely. Everyone I’ve spoken to says you chaired the event evenhandedly & professionally. Labour hysteria pretty pathetic Tue Mar 24 23:55:56 GMT 2015
First the Labour candidate threw teddy out the pram & stormed out of hustings. Then Labour cllrs launch barrage of abuse at @Sarahcdownes Tue Mar 24 23:50:55 GMT 2015
. @AdamJFarrell @Sarahcdownes @zimbot 1st Mike storms out in a tizzy. Now Labour councillors mount hysterical twitter barrage against Chair Tue Mar 24 23:50:23 GMT 2015
@danielbyles @zimbot @Sarahcdownes @AdamJFarrell sounds like all other candidates happy. Audience voted they were happy.Mike being precious! Tue Mar 24 23:44:27 GMT 2015
@zimbot @Sarahcdownes @AdamJFarrell I’ve chaired public meetings evenhandedly before, calling Labour cllrs (& Mike) to speak. It’s not hard Tue Mar 24 23:42:47 GMT 2015

@welshboy82 @CCHQPress @dannyjpalmer because we’ve already taken you out of income tax altogether. Wed Mar 18 15:11:55 GMT 2015
@danielbyles @dannyjpalmer if you earn a low income, you had a tax cut today. If you aspire to buy a home, you had help for that dream today Wed Mar 18 14:18:15 GMT 2015
@dannyjpalmer yes, but that isn’t a reason not to help those who are trying to. Do you aspire to save? Budgets aren’t either/or. Wed Mar 18 14:17:16 GMT 2015
@katyguest36912 ok. Wed Mar 18 14:16:18 GMT 2015
@dannyjpalmer absolute nonsense I’m afraid. You think only rich people want to save? You think rich people are ones who need help to save? Wed Mar 18 14:13:40 GMT 2015
@katyguest36912 lol. Yes, I’m sure that’s it. Wed Mar 18 14:12:40 GMT 2015
@katyguest36912 yes. And it’s interesting that the Leader of the Opposition’s response was clearly not deemed that interesting or important. Wed Mar 18 14:09:37 GMT 2015

@dannyjpalmer I think anyone of the front bench of any party will have been in politics so long, they’ll be a bit out of touch by definition Wed Mar 18 13:56:54 GMT 2015
@katyguest36912 if they thought the man speaking right now (EdM) would be PM in 2 months and had anything interesting to say, they’d stay Wed Mar 18 13:52:55 GMT 2015
@old_man_milford I agree with that. Wed Mar 18 13:51:16 GMT 2015
@bhavikdepala that was at least funny. Even Labour MPs laughed! Wed Mar 18 13:51:03 GMT 2015
@dannyjpalmer do you think EdM is a man of the people? Wed Mar 18 13:50:20 GMT 2015
Press gallery thinned out as soon as EdM stood up. At least half left. Pretty damning - they know he’ll say nothing of interest. #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:48:10 GMT 2015
@LifeOfSarahLou but that was funny. Even Labour MPs laughed. Let’s see if there’s any substance to his response. Still waiting Wed Mar 18 13:46:06 GMT 2015
@Oc_si I wouldn’t really have expected much more specifics. Lots in there that’s helpful - city devolution, driverless cars, IOT support. Wed Mar 18 13:45:01 GMT 2015

@waldjm I think that’s right. Still significantly more flexible than previous ISAs. Wed Mar 18 13:39:37 GMT 2015
Oh dear. If EdM is opening with “Trust Fund Chancellor” and “Bullingdon Boy PM” you know he’s got nothing meaningful to say. #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:37:34 GMT 2015
Now watch EdM make a speech that talks about everything except the budget we have just heard. #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:33:22 GMT 2015

@morrishs2 ...take your Twitter patrol elsewhere and find someone who values your (yes, ignorant) opinion on this more than I do. Goodbye. Sat Feb 28 20:01:29 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 ...but you’re so arrogant and patronising that you have personally decided they aren’t ‘devastated’. Perhaps you should take... Sat Feb 28 19:59:27 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 ok, enough. People cry on my shoulder. One is suicidal. Because they feel ‘devastated’ by what is happening to them, but... Sat Feb 28 19:57:35 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 again that’s a completely different point. You’re clearly patrolling twitter looking to have a specific argument. Sat Feb 28 19:48:57 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 of course that’s true for any project. But that’s a completely different point. Sat Feb 28 19:41:24 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 you should get a job with HS2 Ltd. They are just as callous. Sat Feb 28 19:38:41 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 as I said, support HS2 by all means. But don’t patrol twitter telling people you know nothing about that they aren’t devastated Sat Feb 28 19:33:40 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 seriously? You think having the farm your father and grandfather worked taken off you is not devastating, just because of compo Sat Feb 28 19:30:06 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 that’s pretty devastating. Sat Feb 28 19:28:29 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 or terminally ill yet trapped in home, having to give evidence of what death benefits widow will have to prove hardship? Sat Feb 28 19:27:57 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 if they did, do you think they might find that devastating? Sat Feb 28 19:23:34 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 do your family have HS2 running through a 3 generation family farm, destroying the house and woods where family ashes scattered? Sat Feb 28 19:22:46 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 support HS2 by all means, but show some empathy for those who live along the line - in some cases right through their homes Sat Feb 28 19:19:50 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 what you have seen from staffordshire and on Twitter? Seriously? I’m not going to parade my constituents’ misery for you. Sat Feb 28 19:17:30 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 you were more interested in scoring some sort of cheap point, even googling the borough for its population, than in the facts. Sat Feb 28 19:13:01 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 I’m afraid some people are having their lives devastated. Not everyone of course. But to say no one is does you no credit. Sat Feb 28 19:11:03 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 ...made physically ill because they need to move but estate agents won’t even market their home because they have written it off? Sat Feb 28 19:10:12 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 I’m afraid once again you are being ignorant. Have you sat in someone’s home as they sob in misery, someone being made... Sat Feb 28 19:08:49 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 no I’m not calling you names. I’m using that word in its correct sense. You made no effort to find out what u were commenting on Sat Feb 28 19:06:43 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 regardless of your view on principle of HS2, some ppl along route r having their lives devastated. You should be sensitive 2 that Sat Feb 28 18:41:27 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 ...it should also have been obvious that a ‘drop in’ event over a period of time can’t be judged by a snapshot. Sat Feb 28 18:39:23 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 but you jumped in to comment on something on which you were ignorant. It wasn’t about opposing HS2. It was about local impact Sat Feb 28 18:38:20 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 with respect, that is irrelevant to our event on Fri or my initial tweet. Hence my ‘police’ comment. Be cautious of jumping in Sat Feb 28 18:29:36 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 this village will have a 1km long 31 track railhead constructed on its doorstep and is hit by phases 1 & 2. Hard to overplay that Sat Feb 28 18:21:47 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 ok. But u don’t help yourself or HS2 by ‘policing’ twitter feeds of ppl who r just trying to manage the impact on their community Sat Feb 28 17:53:25 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 it was a drop in event for villagers specifically affected by a 31 track railhead. It wasn’t a constituency event. Sat Feb 28 14:00:38 GMT 2015
@morrishs2 oh dear. Do you even know what the event was? Why do you care? Sat Feb 28 13:59:03 GMT 2015

@norm1037 @SkyNews erm...no! Lol Fri Feb 20 14:43:03 GMT 2015
@williambeebooks @afneil @EdConwaySky someone recharging right now would have a 35% coal fired car. Coal & gas 64%: http://t.co/cvgMEmq13H Fri Feb 20 13:02:10 GMT 2015
@paulypilot @afneil @EdConwaySky true, but the Capacity Mechanism is helping some old coal to stay in system longer than previously expected Fri Feb 20 12:35:44 GMT 2015
@TrillionFund @EdConwaySky I agree re Grid. & I don’t want invstmnt in coal, but Cap Mech is leading to it. Hence my pref for gas in med trm Fri Feb 20 12:17:09 GMT 2015
@TrillionFund @EdConwaySky ...so “renewables” isn’t the answer to the “gas or coal?” question (other than in the much longer run). Fri Feb 20 10:07:13 GMT 2015
@TrillionFund @EdConwaySky even under the most optimistic decarbonisation scenarios we will be using fossils fuels for decades. So... Fri Feb 20 10:05:16 GMT 2015
@TrillionFund @EdConwaySky not exclusively. We are already investing in renewables. The coal/gas problem is subtly different. Fri Feb 20 09:52:53 GMT 2015
@danielbyles @earthygirl01 @BenThomWood to be honest I’m really not that interested - can we agree to disagree and leave it? Thu Feb 19 22:05:13 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood and we went on to have a conversation - but you veered off down an irrelevant tangent re EU referendum Thu Feb 19 22:03:02 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood which obviously wasn’t a direct quote. Was referring to this: http://t.co/iDATXORgwQ Thu Feb 19 22:01:47 GMT 2015
@BenThomWood try to. In this case I don’t think earthy is interested in a real discussion. Thu Feb 19 21:42:51 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood I didn’t misquote Flint. I quoted EdM. Flint didn’t even know about the policy until she heard the speech. Thu Feb 19 21:41:33 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood You and I are not going to agree. Perhaps we should leave it there. Thu Feb 19 21:24:13 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood nonsense. You are very quick to impugn my motives and look for offence, rather than discuss the issue. Thu Feb 19 21:23:07 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood not patronising. But you’re so obviously conflating 2 different things that I suspect you’re doing it on purpose Thu Feb 19 21:20:59 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood erm...I think u’re a little confused. If u can’t tell the diff between those two things then not sure I can help Thu Feb 19 19:12:11 GMT 2015
@earthygirl01 @BenThomWood so Labour’s flagship energy policy isn’t a policy at all? It’s a future negotiation? Interesting. Thu Feb 19 18:28:07 GMT 2015

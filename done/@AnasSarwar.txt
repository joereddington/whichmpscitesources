After last debate Yessers wanted Sturgeon to debate instead.On this performance it seems it's Nicola in a Salmond costume #bbcindyref #rammy
Does Salmond not realise that "3 Plan Bs" means no Plan B?? #bbcindyref
Salmond confirms that the "Vote No and our NHS will be privatised in 5-10 years" claim by @YesScotland was a lie #bbcindyref
Salmond asks for a mandate, but there are people voting yes - including half @YesScotland board - who don't want to keep pound. #bbcindyref
@Guy_Wersh @NicolaSturgeon @jimmurphymp @WingsScotland cheers, they loved it!
Tonight Salmond must start telling the the truth about currency, economy, pensions & jobs and stop telling lies about our NHS #bbcindyref

.@thiajock @matt_mann95 what's this got to do with India? Again I ask, why are you asking this of a Scotsman? Fri Apr 24 16:54:05 BST 2015
.@thiajock @matt_mann95 what's the UK General election got to do with India and Pakistan. Why are you asking that question of a Scotsman? Fri Apr 24 16:42:02 BST 2015

Biggest cheers when TV shows Cameron leaving Downing St forever will not be coming from SNP HQ, but Scottish Labour's http://t.co/mqz8j0IL4P Mon Feb 02 12:43:37 GMT 2015

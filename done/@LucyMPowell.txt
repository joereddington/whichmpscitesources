Labour will end unethical employment practices http://t.co/v0rCbPKCpC - great from @jon_trickett on tackling impact of migration on low pay
@pigreen @RachelReevesMP read the actual words and policy. It's very much part of our values.
@David_Llew @RachelReevesMP except we don't have same social security system across EU.
@David_Llew @RachelReevesMP not at all. It's about (a) contribution principle (b) tackling the downward pressures on low skilled pay
Labour will curb tax credits for EU migrants, says @RachelReevesMP http://t.co/8nDphHQRAQ

@Another_OfMany @TheStaggers @SeemaMalhotra1 @johnmcdonnellMP no not acceptable. As we've said.

Good discussion with the Manchester Uni Politics Society this evening. Lots of tough questions!

@LouisDegenhardt you can't have it both ways
@LouisDegenhardt eh?
@LouisDegenhardt I've no idea what you mean. Email me if you want to discuss further.
@LouisDegenhardt that's correct. I'm hardly going to give finer detail on a broad biog of my 20 odd year career!
@LouisDegenhardt I'm not responsible for guardian. But I've always been very clear.
@LouisDegenhardt they aren't my references!! Others who want to portray me in a certain way. I've always been very clear & proud of facts

@taylorkwinship @ThomHetheringto me too! It's part of a long journey. And we still have far to travel.

@taylorkwinship @ThomHetheringto we are definitely not cosying up! This is good but doesn't in anyway outweigh all the bad.

Excellent piece from @Leicesterliz on coding after school club. Rising ambition while delivering wrap-around http://t.co/ZuL5YelXHs

@JohnRentoul @George_Osborne @FraserNelson point being, Osborne would have wanted different model.
@JohnRentoul @George_Osborne @FraserNelson 3 big differences here tho 1. GM not Mcr 2. Real powers esp over buses 3. Not another tier of gov
@k3nny18 agree there's been some awful incidents recently. Can you email me and I will get you a response?
@helenpidd @SirRichardLeese 3 differences here 1. Real power 2. GM wide 3. Not another layer of gov but 1 tier with local gov

@Markfergusonuk yes great idea! Lots to discuss!
@eredarP @Markfergusonuk other places ready to go with devolution ie Cornwall. Need to work through for other places & they need to decide
@njw3000 always supported electoral reform
@Markfergusonuk no one-size-fits-all solution. Power at a level people know & can relate to. Regional assemblies really not right for Mcr
@Markfergusonuk English regional assemblies not the answer. Cities, combined authorities, etc. real power for real places!

I've only seen last 10 mins of #indyref debate. The chairing is so biased! Is he Yes? #bettertogether
Managing to watch it on STV iplayer
The bit that's on @BBCNews now is showing Salmond being really shouty and interrupting.  Not good viewing.
@GwynneMP @BevaniteEllie I'm on Virgin!
@chrischarlton @BevaniteEllie thanks!
“@BevaniteEllie: How is everyone watching this?!! #indyref #bettertogether” was just going to ask twitter the same? Help!
@Coulstock1 @tom_watson @BBCNews agree @cathynewman
Exclusive: 'Why I quit over Gaza' - Baroness Warsi - #c4news http://t.co/qwntn4vldC
Watched Philomena last night. What a fantastic film. What a tragedy too.
“@RichardAngell: I agree with @LucyMPowell. Nasty tactics by a nasty Tory: http://t.co/pHb4Za4Ko4 (h/t @MirrorJames)” it's awful
@tombolarola I know. It's something I've previously raised with the gov. Can you email me?
@Dr_Ulrichsen yes sorry. It was a slip of tongue. Others have already pointed out.
@pareayh email me. I've made my views on what is happening in Gaza v clear. But I share concerns about potential impact on communities here
@pareayh @Linda4President @BBCWestminHour suggest you email me rather than sending me unwarranted tweets
@pareayh @Linda4President @BBCWestminHour I beg your pardon?
@pareayh @BBCNews I have been contacted by dozens of people with their concerns about this
@Linda4President @BBCWestminHour it's nature of interviews, we slip up. Apols!
@pareayh @BBCNews we need to make sure it doesn't become that, was my point, as many of my constituents worry
@Linda4President @BBCWestminHour sorry wrong word
@eddwilson @BBCWestminHour sorry wrong word
@PetersWooll @labourpress @BBCWestminHour yes!
I will be on @BBCWestminHour this evening at 10pm discussing the weekend news & politics

@JWils60 actually you're not represented by many women at all
@ClaireRuthWalke @AnnaYearley @MailOnline thanks Claire
@havina_giraffe agree. That's my main point.

@Furqan_Naeem it's been a fabulous summer weather wise! Prob not great for fasting though.
Happy Eid Mubarak to all who are celebrating today. Best wishes to you & your family.
Whatever yr views abt events in Gaza & Israel, & I totally condemn escalation of violence, it's unacceptable 2 target law-abiding Brits here
@webbie33p see my last tweet. Will look into
@mrcjcb @ManCityCouncil will look into. See last tweet.
Lots of ppl in touch abt targeting of Jewish-owned shop on King St during Sat's protest. If true, this is deplorable. Taken up w authorities
@ManFireStation @MechanicsManch yes do! Otherwise it doesn't get in my diary. Best not to rely on me on twitter!
Fantastic turnout at Party in the Park East Mcr in Philips Park. Good to see the @twitdispensary team there too!
Lovely dat celebrating 10th anniversary of @NEPHRA_GN What a tribute to the community http://t.co/3Lm9m4D9Sj

Me and Cllr June Hitchen checking out the new BMX track at Philips Park, East Mcr @Carmines62 http://t.co/90SqyNv0Dj
Before all that, I'll be on @LBC discussing @Ed_Miliband just after 10am
Busy day today: @NEPHRA_GN 10th birthday party in Moston; followed by Party in Park at Brookdale Park w @Carmines62
@mrchrisjohn @Ed_Miliband absolutely.
Excellent stuff from @Ed_Miliband on #marr He seems very much at ease, confident, powerful.
@OffertonLabour good point
#marr is on early (8am) today. Big interview with @Ed_Miliband shortly
@BillFairfoull yes let's do that!
@mtpennycook @OnnMel you're going to have a great intake also incl @Jo_Cox1 @JeffSmithetc & loads more!
@_grammar_ oh yes! I stand corrected
@BillFairfoull agree. Whose been warned off??
@Robbill123 @5050Parliament nope
Another excellent woman selected for Labour in a Labour held seat with a retiring male MP. We are trying to get numbers up @5050Parliament
@anna_seven my daughter wants more pictures of the giants!
@antmccaul @Ashdeve oh no. That's terrible.
@TeresasMisc sounds good. Will look
@TeresasMisc I know. Absolutely. These things get reduced to some false binary argument!
@petegerrard1 @PCollinsTimes @BBCNewsnight thanks Pete!
@TeresasMisc @PCollinsTimes sorry! It's too short a time to challenge everything. Would rather make my own points.
Didn't get time to pull @PCollinsTimes up abt image vs reality re Gove, who he supports, which contradicts his point on @BBCNewsnight
I will be on @BBCNewsnight later with @PCollinsTimes discussing @Ed_Miliband speech today
I want to build a future in which our kids have a better life than us. @Ed_Miliband will be the Prime Minister to do that
Labour 2020: Leadership and big ideas. Tories 2020: Photo ops and complacency. Our choice - @Ed_Miliband speech today http://t.co/2fK87DJYtW
@trialia ok. You can just send to me as email. Doesn't matter whether it's perfect for me. I will get on to it asap
@Jules_Clarke @trialia yes that's what I meant!
@Jules_Clarke @trialia yes of course.  Can you email me all the details?  Thanks
@twitdispensary it's brilliant!  I was shocked too.
Lots to discuss at tonight's Manchester Central Labour Party meeting. Maybe the glorious weather might put some off!
Keeping childcare high on the agenda http://t.co/QBX8FlZkAj spot on by @rosa_battle
@twitdispensary Fantastic to have come so far-real testament to hard work by the group. Look forward to working together over coming months.

“@richdurber: "We need even more women entering politics" @LucyMPowell writes in @MENnewsdesk http://t.co/G5PYvXQrfq” my latest column
@CllrRalphBerry @GloriaDePieroMP @lizperry_ @dave4wibsey @bsclplive love it!
Nicky Morgan herself answers my questions on summer holiday childcare. She had nothing to say. Clearly trooping out line "as a working mum"
We've got first education questions without Gove and Liz Truss this afternoon. Watch from 2.30pm.
@VirtualResistan @Rugbymumno9 @RachelReevesMP we don't timetable business in parliament (gov do) but likely September
@StuartLong01 @RachelReevesMP it'll be after recess now
@Iain_33 @RachelReevesMP our last motion was based on Lib Dem policy agreed at their conference. Still voted against
Excellent news @RachelReevesMP will be calling another vote in Parliament on Bedroom Tax to give Lib Dems ANOTHER chance to vote against
@DavidMills73 @JonAshworth @AnnaYearley @fletchersimon @EmilieOldknow agree
Who never get a mention (other than unfair criticism). Well done @AnnaYearley @fletchersimon Torsten Bell & @EmilieOldknow et al 2/2
Who never get a mention (other than unfair criticism). Well done @AnnaYearley @fletchersimon Torsten Bell & @EmilieOldknow et al
Labour's #NPF2014 has produced really good policy in a grown up way. As well as politicians credit goes to back room staff 1/2
@tom_watson @LabourList what?! I didn't get notification ;) Tea Cup I presume. Check out Central Library.
@tom_watson @LabourList you love it really
Despite the rain (stopped now), great crowds & atmosphere at Moss Side Caribbean Carnival
“@moss_side: Big up the Caribbean Carnival, today and tomorrow in Platt Fields Park http://t.co/qsreLpcv61 http://t.co/bsViFEMaDb” I'm going
@Carmines62 @GarryBridges @Olliemanco @rosa_battle looks great. I'll come!
@ste942000 @ManCityCouncil @SparkleWeekend can you email me? Twitter not best way to elicit a response!
“@cathynewman: School's out, now what to do with the kids? My @TeleWonderWomen blog here http://t.co/YfHljvQtQu” such a big issue
Good Children's Commission on Poverty session yesterday with  @childrensociety read about it here  #throughyoungeyes http://t.co/sYeE5pUm5L
@manccountryblue oh sorry.  My email should be working.  Phone me instead 0161 232 0872
Good for @duncanhames for being the first MP to take a baby through voting lobby! Excellent development for Parliament. @joswinson
@IsabelHardman we'd all rather we didn't have to have them but it's the only tool that works!
@Telegraph @IsabelHardman also, depressingly, after today there's now NO childcare minister
@Telegraph @IsabelHardman a good piece. But Lab does better than "slightly" with 36% MPs & nearly half Shadow Cabinet women
. Congratulations to @tes Primary School of the Year @stmarysmossside in my constituency.Great achievement.  http://t.co/bJQgQ9i8Pp
@stmarysmossside Congratulations to everyone for the award. Brilliant!
Either Nick Gibb is also childcare or the PM hasn't appointed a minister for childcare in his "reshuffle for women"!

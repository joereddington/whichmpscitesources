@andrewpercy
Just arriving at Day Close, Keadby, to speak with residents being offered well-being checks for the over 75s.
I've got around 1,000 flood update letters going out to residents today in Goole.
Great evening with Lord Chancellor tonight. Nice boost to campaign funds too. Had to set extra tables up!
Lord Chancellor, Chris Grayling, here with us in Elsham for campaign fundraiser. Sold out the event.
@nataliepye_ pleased to have had you. Sorry I only saw u for a short while. Tend to be out and about!
Honour this afternoon to be able to spend some time with one of our Burma veterans. Mr Shepard laid a wreath on Sunday. Popped for a chat.
Poor Lab canvassers. Some of our biggest helpers doing as we ask and telling them they're undecided. Helps us monitor Lab activity. Lol
Labour upsetting the good folk of Broughton today with telephone calls. Some very unhappy people!

2/2 until any decision on the sale is made. Local MPs offered to work with Tata and potential buyers to support the site in any way we can.
1/2 Good meeting just now with Tata and the potential new buyers. Local MPs & Council leader attended. Positive discussion. Long way to go
Great news that the unemployment figure for Goole is further down to 498 in October. Down from 527 in September!
Today's canvass return 66 for me and just five Labour voters identified. Ouch!
Couple of the team out canvassing in Winterton today. Some of the results sound v positive.

Presently on the train back home to attend Remembrance Day events in the constituency.
Woke up to some lovely emails from residents in villages along our various rivers regarding my update on flood defence issues I sent last wk
@eleanorbox the wrong side you mean!
@Goolie1Derek it wasn't quite like that. The procedural issues were unclear. I opposed the transfer of any powers all the same
@Goolie1Derek no not really!
What is locker 248, where is it and why do I have a key to it all of a sudden!
Turning to other matters, the key I found in the office to locker 248 continues to intrigue. I located locker 248. It don't fit it!
Well that was a bloody confusing vote. Procedural acrobatics to say the least! Confused me anyway!
Positive meetings with @VodafoneUK and @EE today. They both agreed to look at signal spots raised by residents. http://t.co/cQrIFiZfSs

@paulholgate67 thanks much. I'm meeting EE tomorrow as it happens so will raise
@RooKnight far too kind in fact
@paulholgate67 which network please
@SheriffLonestar that's a proper not spot. We have two in the patch. It's the partial not spots that affect more peeps.
@SheriffLonestar yer. The Jags did what they always do, make it hard for themselves. Enjoyed it all the same. Plus the steelers got nailed!
Thank you jets for dealing with the Steelers tonight. Hahahahha
A number of residents have raised concerns in various spots including Winterton and the Isle. Will be pushing for avtion!

Parliament a little earlier than normal means I'm able to meet a couple of mobile phone operators tomorrow to raise local signal issues!!!!!
Enjoyed Wembley. Now watching more NFL on the tele. Wembley is no Paul Brown Stadium though! http://t.co/IetZVAcpMi
@SheriffLonestar have to say first half of first quarter I thought it could go either way.
@DarraenClarkeCR  a pleasure. You must be proud of him.
@SheriffLonestar I was a little later than I thought due to MP duties. It was good fun tho. Bit one sided but better than Cinci game
@robgawthorp @Jimmy_Myers @tabryars @miguel1982 Most certainly am! http://t.co/6ZIaWdM132
@andycomfort such a shame our local Labour Party don't agree with you. Residents not impressed!
Am very proud of local cadets today for their work helping make our local services. http://t.co/my6EbS5C1X
Already had first complaint from a resident about certain people trying to politicise wreath laying locally. Not the day for that though
Indebted to local Councillors for laying wreaths for me across the constituency at services I couldn't get to, Inc Brigg, Winterton, Crowle
@flcro you absolute idiot. It's a focus for many of those families. As they are throughout the whole of our United Kingdom.
@DanielOlivePol very cruel indeed.
'We Will Remember Them' Goole Cenotaph looking stunning. http://t.co/3pKsAIuMF1
So proud also that so many people from our area turned out to support the parade and watch service. I swear the crowds increase each year.
Was very emotional watching him lay it. Such strength of character. He'd written me to say how he didn't want the Burma conflict forgetting
Lovely Remembrance Sunday service at Goole today. Got choked up watching the Burma Star veteran lay the wreath we helped him to get.
Lovely Remembrance Concert in Brigg earlier. http://t.co/0r24jftmjj
Just arrived at the Brigg Centenary WW1 Remembrance Concert I am helping to MC this evening.
Wow. @HullUniTories doing us proud today. Lunch and then back at it. Leave me some to do! On my way.

Fantastic response from residents in Rawcliffe today re our fundraising for a cabinet for a Public Access Defibrillator in the village.
@eve_sbean I shall check it out. Cheers.

@tehreedy yes I would drop DD a line.
@tehreedy BT have a new technology they are rolling out. We're hoping to get some in N Lincs but would be next year.
@eve_sbean I will check it out. Not sure what Vote Bob is. Had a few messages. Assumed a spoof. Will
@tehreedy hmm. Thought I'd spelled it wrong but it is Quickline. That's a shame. They are expanding network. 8k is about 6 miles so way far
@tehreedy there will be little pick up if that far away I guess. There will be a broadband extension programme post 2015 which may help
@tehreedy Nowhere near as much as with North Lincs. The ERYC team have kept information more closely guarded. It's frustrated us a little.
@jbbcma3 @jdubs88 strictly of course there are no limits here. A limit kicks in for the final few months.
Canvasser reports, not only Labour convert in that community this evening. The hard work and regular contact is appreciated it seems.!
Great to hear from  canvasser tonight they encountered a committed socialist in 70s. Voting for me next year cos of local work. First time!
In total schools in the constituency received ¬£2.2m of pupil premium funding last year and ¬£2.8m this year to support disadvantaged pupils.

@tintodog true!
@neil_laws Wow. That was awesome!
@neil_laws and football too judging by this game so far
@MichDonohue I will enjoy beating this candidate! And so apparently will a lot of people from Goole who have contacted me, incl Lab members!
@neil_laws yer it was under an inch or two on pre show
All irrelevant of course but find polls interesting. I'm a geek
They use the local elec results and we didn't stand in Goole North last time so add that in last month's predic of Lab win wud  be Tory win
Although looking at methodology, last month's prediction of narrow Lab victory was flawed as their method predicts no Tory vote in Goole N
Wonder if my labour opponent will tweet out the latest electoral calculus prediction which predicts Tory hold in Brigg and Goole...
@neil_laws where did all the snow go?
@neil_laws @nfl Watching ur boys now.
Canvassing compared to before last elec, we're doing much better than even then. Lab vote soft lots converting to us because of local work.
15,000 residents will also be receiving a survey in the post from me this week. Canvassing this week has been great. People like the contact
Still getting lots of positive responses following my recent letters to residents who've told us concerned about immigration. 1000s sent out

In Winterton for the meeting with Winterton Rangers.
@DianaJohnsonMP What an awful idea!
@DianaJohnsonMP many people have simply chosen not to take up the flood protection grants. I've written to local flood victims to encourage
@DianaJohnsonMP The payments are made quote quickly as the Councils manage the repair grants, it's a lack of applications which is the issue
@DerekSmith76 yes 6p in every pound is on private providers , it was 5p under Labour.
I should however thank Lab for giving me more coverage in the local paper to remind people of those cuts under then
As I keep saying, Labour determined to play the NHS for cheap politics. All to hide fact locally NHS services were slashed on their watch
Tuesday Head of the NHS confirmed at Cttee  European Commission confirms TTIP won't impact on NHS. Thursday Lab locally scaremonger it will
@DianaJohnsonMP instead concentrate on the tens of millions spent on defence repairs and improvements such as five million at Reedness in my
@DianaJohnsonMP in terns of flood repair and renewal, it's ridiculous to attack Govt if residents have chosen not to apply!
@DianaJohnsonMP So what have you done to encourage applications to the fund? Many residents chose not to apply.
@RalphSavage @andrewpercy @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP in fairness tho, sadly, what we see is funding spikes after a flood disaster
@RalphSavage @andrewpercy @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP of course had lab spent what they were told to spend over a decade ago...
@RalphSavage @andrewpercy over this spending period it's ¬£3 billion. Far higher than under Lab
@guyshrubsole I also strongly suspect the Chancellor doesn't know what's going to be in his statement yet.
@DianaJohnsonMP But Labour support current spending plans.
@RalphSavage @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP My communities are very thankful of this. Best to concentrate on solutions not silly party politic
@RalphSavage @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP I'm just pointing out how we've had millions in extra funding since the surge.
@guyshrubsole @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP I'm not missing a single opportunity to raise it but it would be incredible to achieve that.
@guyshrubsole @LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP That's a natter for the Chancellor. The Autumn Statement is one possible option, but not only one
@DianaJohnsonMP A better response would be to constructively work on the Humber Strategy we are all backing. I raised that today, u didn't.
@DianaJohnsonMP That's tens of millions in my constituency alone announced this year.
@DianaJohnsonMP Snaith awarded millions recently, Hull too and then of course the ¬£13 million for Lincs Lakes.
@DianaJohnsonMP Sorry Diana as you know full well flood defence funding is rising and our area is benefiting significantly.
@DianaJohnsonMP @LabourDefra ¬£5.1 million for Reedness alone. Nearly ¬£2 million for Burringham
@DianaJohnsonMP @LabourDefra Simply untrue. We've had more flood defence money locally since the floods and you know it.
@LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP @David_Cameron Time Labour condemned their local Cllrs in North Lincs for voting against extra money for floods
@LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP @David_Cameron Snaith river banks being strenghten, Burringham the same. Millions on repairs too
@LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP @David_Cameron our local LEP has bee granted millions for projects locally.
@LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP @David_Cameron really unfair to use tragedy of floods for politics. Right now the EA raising banks at Reedness
@LabourDefra @DianaJohnsonMP @David_Cameron we've had millions in flood defence works since the flooding locally. And you know it.
@PHammondMP @foreignoffice what or who are the V4
@martin_mpd well we've had millions for defences such as Reedness and Snaith and Burringham so it certainly works.
I was once again able to raise the need for specific funding to be allocated to Humber catchment flood defences in the chamber earlier.
Labour condemned Govt for cutting solar subsidies 4 turning fields into solar farms earlier. Tell that to the Belton residents fighting one
Winterton Imagination Library Year Anniversary http://t.co/ltUcO8mNt3
@JennyChapman at least the first government ever to agree the principle. So a start. We shall see. You'd never be recalled tho
@Spetmologer giving 5per cent of the public the right to start to recall their MP is not window dressing. Ur Tory hate is pretty pathetic.
@JennyChapman you did the right thing then. Report is too late to get the details correct.
@Spetmologer check ur facts mate. I voted for proper recall by the public. Most of us who did were Tories.
Have just spoken in this important debate on domestic violence.
@JennyChapman improved it that should have said.
@JennyChapman fallacious, the vote killed it dead. You could have supported and then I proved the detail at later stages. Now it's dead
Oh the irony, Labour cllrs asking me to support recall whilst local Labour MPs vote against.

Just voted for real recall to allow the public to recall their MP. Sadly we lost the vote.
@DN14OWL next year flood re kicks in which shud help. Let me know if u struggle with that line.
@DN14OWL can u email. There is a special brokerage service
@DanburyPark if we getting a majority of course. We are the only party who can deliver that referendum.
@TKershawST I'll have u know I barely made that decade
@TKershawST besides I was barely born then!
@TKershawST ouch.
Not taxpayer funded I should add!
Very positive response to the several thousand letter we sent out last week on various issues. Wait until next week's 10k going out!
@TKershawST I didn't know that. Are u in it?
I'm always accidentally bumping into people as I run to the gym. Except I don't run or visit a gym!
Looking over this past weeks canvass returns. Nice to see yet more Labour voters saying they'll back me because of local work and action.
@karmachamedeon maybe it's a guide dog in training. Was a lovely dog. Doesn't bother me either.
@karmachamedeon nope. Doesn't seem to be.

@jbbcma3 @andrewbarrett I had a ticket!
So despite having a ticket, I missed the best NFL game at Wembley! MP duties got in the way! Grrrr
Went shopping and ended up having a really long chat with a Goolie about how fantastic the Imagination Library we set up locally is. Nice.
Talking to a resident. Went to pull a card out my pocket, instead pulled out a pair of latex gloves! From @YASCFR job honest!
@TerenceSmith14 ur very welcome. Lab need a lot of help locally to maintain second and not to drop to third so well done.
@robgawthorp don't even go there. Had a ticket but MP duties got in the way!!! Not happy.
@DeputyBrownTX what an excellent response. They're absolute hypocrites.
@DeputyBrownTX good lord no. Like most Brigg folk, they get ignored. Save the NHS from Labour is all we need.
Lunch in the White Hart after a busy morning in Brigg. Back out again. Strong support here today.
Just popped to Goole office and now on @YASCFR duty. #nhs #yas
Supper Club I attended tonight was great. Speaker was a local paramedic sharing the work they do and also some cpr training
@DanburyPark I agree.
Outrageous EU demands for an extra ¬£1.7bn from hardworking UK taxpayers. Pleased the PM has taken a strong stance & refused to pay.

Great morning at Winterton Infants School celebrating 1 year since we launched the Imagination Library in North Lincs http://t.co/Kw8K9g1txc
Had a bit of time free in the end so just spent an hour or so door knocking in Brigg. Lots of friendly people about.
Two people stopped me today to say we shouldn't pay the EU a penny more. Could not agree more!
Bless the Winterton resident who waited patiently outside the event I was at earlier to raise an issue. had seen id be there from newsletter
Just a few letters going out today! http://t.co/bAc33ZX6Nn
Already in one year since we started there has been a 12% improvement in the levels reached at 5. So proud we created this locally.
Spent much of this morning playing with play-do at the Imagination Library one year anniversary in Winterton.

NHS 5 yr plan essentially proposes moving services out of hospitals. Something often opposed by the public when proposed.
@nickyt739 what we now want is long term support
@nickyt739 thanks. Well a lot is already happening, strengthening banks at Burringham and Snaith. Raising then at Reedness etc
Try again. NHS five year plan raises really int points on how we tackle demographic shift.

I told him resources must be thin on the ground if they're having to resort to watching me in the Commons! Odd for him to make the link!
Went for an Indian tonight in London and the lad who served me said he'd watched a speech of mine in his A level politics class! Odd!
@Bill_Cheetham @jackycrawford @andrea_davison If election was tomorrow. We'd win by about 6 to 7k here. Our polling shows that.
@Bill_Cheetham It was certainly an element, but Ian was still very well liked.
@Bill_Cheetham @jackycrawford @andrea_davison Truth is labour could struggle to come second. I reckon they will but ukip close. Poll it! ;)
@Bill_Cheetham @jackycrawford @andrea_davison Never mind electoral calculus Bill, told me I'd lose last time. Poll the seat ;) interesting!

Too many puff pieces and sugary crap written about Trudeau. Give us some policy substance please! Obama was all image, how's that worked?

@lizzy630_liz @Petersbrooking @guest_graham Liz, we know all about labour's bully boy tactics locally. Just block them, not worth it.
@Petersbrooking @guest_graham @lizzy630_liz Aren't they a nasty lot Liz.
@Petersbrooking @guest_graham @lizzy630_liz Such a shame my Lab opponent allows this nasty personalised actions by her team.
@Petersbrooking @guest_graham @lizzy630_liz It's certainly quotable. This guy is a bit of a hater. Personally very rude. Nasty Labour.
@lizzy630_liz @guest_graham This is Labour's local campaign team speaking. Disgusting.
How disgusting of them to talk down the local economy and all the local people getting new jobs. Proves what we hear on the doors about Lab
It is quite disgusting that faced with falling unemployment, members of local Lab campaign team response is 'it's all lies'.
Further proof of labour's highly nasty and personalised campaigning locally.
Disgusted that key member of my opponents campaign team has in the past 24 hours made personal attacks and accused us of lies on unemp figs.
@PaulJosephPrice @EstherMcVeyMP oh that made me chuckle. The people support a referendum. You don't so you dismiss the majority as futile.

We talked in particular about the need to get commitment on jobs from potential buyers.
Caught a word /w the Chancellor at the Downing St breakfast this morning re Scunthorpe Steel Works situation. Has assured me he is involved.
@paulverrico Paul, that's kind of you to tweet me. It was least we could do. I'm just so sorry it wasn't a cure we were helping with.
@guest_graham @LeeGoodwinYork Indeed we shall see and not long to go. Best of luck all the same. Good evening to you.
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham Labour should poll the seat and get the data. They'd get a shock!
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham We are canvassing at the moment excluding known Tories and we struggle to find Lab second anywhere.
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham I hate to keep harping to actual elections, but Lab nearly lost in their safest ward in Goole and nailed in Bri
@guest_graham @LeeGoodwinYork hahah. The only people on the ground are the local Tories. Nobody ever hears from Lab. #deludedleftie
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham Keep up the 'good' work though. Ur welcome here anytime.
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham Most of the activity has been in the most Labour areas I didn't win last time and even then I'm told bad for u
@guest_graham @Bill_Cheetham yes, it's just wonderful for you. I mean that's why at every election since 2010 locally Lab do worse!
@LeeGoodwinYork @guest_graham he hasn't a clue about our seat. Just ignor
@LeeGoodwinYork @guest_graham Erm, I'd spent four years at it and hundreds of thousands of leaflets. We had a good profile. She's none.
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham Bill ignore him. Local Lab MPS, her own campaign team and the constit surveying all say they can't win.
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham he's a good wind up merchant. Best ignored Bill.
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham Look at the Euro results! Look at Brigg by election. I only need to look at my own canvass sheets
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham It's pure fantasy, every time B and G goes to the polls Lab get nailed locally and Lab activists know it.
@guest_graham @LeeGoodwinYork Plus we've actually surveyed the seat. It ain't pretty for Labour!
@guest_graham @LeeGoodwinYork They've canvassed the most Lab areas and even there, members of her campaign team tell me it's not good.
@guest_graham @LeeGoodwinYork ignore him. Truth is nobody's heard of her and the election results have Labour in a very poor third place
@tommygilchrist on't train back so may miss it.
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham @LordAshcroft Labour have never been good at doing sums Bill.
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham @LordAshcroft And besides, as lab activists locally keep telling me, they aren't getting a good response!
@Bill_Cheetham @guest_graham @LordAshcroft 5 per cent doesn't! The swing has to be higher than that to win here. Lol.
@SoleCrowleSoul let's see what happens in Dec
Good news, my assistant @martinvickersmp has appeared at Donny station. Getting the same train as me to London. Someone to carry my bags.
A photo from earlier with the Minister @claire4devizes http://t.co/2hRDjnJw0m
@SoleCrowleSoul You must have got something out of it we didn't.
@SoleCrowleSoul @claire4devizes Did you read the document?
@hornbeamfairy @kbrown201230 Just look at the Brigg by election in July. Our best result ever there, Labour's worst EVER
@hornbeamfairy @kbrown201230 Possible they could finish third here behind UKIP as in May in the Euros. Their vote is disintegrating.
@hornbeamfairy @kbrown201230 total collapse of the lab vote in Goole is happening here.
@hornbeamfairy @kbrown201230 I'm afraid evidence from both the Euros and our surveying is the opposite. The rise in ukip helps us locally.
Burringham residents should be receiving my letter today re calls for a bypass. V pleased that the Council has agreed to a feasability study
@SoleCrowleSoul @claire4devizes evidence for that please
Just dropped @claire4devizes at Barnetby Station where she is now riding a @TPExpressTrains service through to Doncaster.
Really good visit by rail minister @claire4devizes to the constituency & local area. Lobbied her re our direct services to Manchester.
Team North Lincs will be split today @martinvickersmp and I lobbying over our rail services and @NicDakinMP doing battle on steel works.

@CFRAshby @EMASNHSTrust thanks much. Enjoyed it and I did manage to find it back from Leicester to Goole.
@HullsEnterprise no, I've come via Leicester and Sheffield! A long journey.
@leeroyruddell that should be a legal requirement!
@pseudograph yes boss. Spot on! Chicken keba.
@AlwaysBlueLou correct!!
You know what a late arrival home to Goole means?
Now on the train back to Goole. Home for tonight as have Minister visits tomorrow. Then back down to London for votes on Friday
@robin1951rd tickets on the actual ambulances?? Seriously?
@robin1951rd not sure I understood that.
Just arrived in Leicester where I'm speaking to fellow NHS volunteers at the @EMASNHSTrust First Responder conference.
@treeboy_steve yes we do. The defib is being provided by the GPs
Goole Ambulance Shift http://t.co/qjWKzStB8x
@goose0406 can u send me an email to brigg.goole@gmail.com with details please. Best not to post ur personal details on twitte
There has been a 34% decrease in youth unemployment in the Brigg & Goole and the Isle of Axholme constituency in the past year.
@goose0406 can u send me your address in the constituency via email.
I failed to get in at PMQs on Tata Steel sale. Pleased @NicDakinMP did and secured a meeting for us all with the PM.
Nervous re Scunthorpe Steel situation though and have raised with the PM.
Unemployment across Brigg & Goole and the Isle of Axholme down 415 in the year to September.
Great news that unemployment has fallen even further in Goole, from 551 in August to 527 last month. In fact, it's down by 100 since April!
@CynthiaRimswell 'capable'. Oh dear! Too much pressure!
@BCCare I'd love to but I'm on my way to speak to NHS volunteers at that point so please accept my Apols.
@CynthiaRimswell @RadioHumberside this needs raising in Parliament!
@JamesMills1984 I'm not bright enough to understand.
@Welshracer why thank you.
My spelling is awful today. Now in Health Committee. Back in debate on UK devolution after this.

@mattyw451 very kind of u
About to go on @BBCNews live to discuss English votes for English laws.
@PompeyGoat @Dom_T4 just look at the form of the person who moved the motion!
@Pauli_Ticks @GlynDaviesMP Well it was moved by somebody who has form on some quite hateful things!
I boycotted the vote, the anti-Israeli lobby know all about boycotts
So less than half of the House of Commons voted on Palestinian statehood. #notinmyname
Reassured that vote will not change Govt policy at all which is far more sensible in only supporting statehood when it supports peace.
I don't like abstaining in votes but it is best not to credence to backbench business when it has been taken over by a front bench
Peace will only come by a negotiated settlement, not unilateral actions by Israel hating Labour MPs
With Labour whipping for a backbench vote and Govt abstaining, it will not represent the views of the Commons one bit.
This vote on Palestinian statehood is something I will not vote on. Speeches in support have been filled with hate, not hope.
Happy Thanksgiving fellow Canadians.
@mrwayneg can u email me please.
Clampdown on Illegal Foreign Drivers http://t.co/npmh3YVXHS
Hundreds of residents received our letter on the subject yesterday morning.
Some lovely emails coming in from Skippingdale thanking myself and the Councillors for the decision last week regarding coal storage locally
Well that sucked @Bengals!
@robjpLFC no worries, what I'm paid for after all.
@robjpLFC but then again, holiday companies are reflecting the prices of airlines, hotels overseas etc etc so not exactly easy.
@robjpLFC perhaps a better way to try to address this is schools staggering holidays or holiday companies being pressured.
@robjpLFC indeed, but without some sort of sanction, we could,have a very unmanageable system. The schools gets the money not taxman tho
@robjpLFC I think a balance is needed and schools just need to work with parents to manage it. Too many today are far too strict on it tho
@robjpLFC indeed, but the start of term is a very important time and I wouldn't support extended holidays over that period.
@robjpLFC you couldn't say have half your class missing in two weeks running up to summer hols. Makes the school unworkable and damages all
@robjpLFC but then, I think a parent taking a child out during exam year for example, would be unwise.
@robjpLFC but at end of the day, my view is parents have rights and should not be unreasonably frustrated.
@robjpLFC a balance needed, as a teacher it can be very difficult if lots of kids missing at different times. Esp if for long periods.
@robjpLFC schools just need to be reasonable and Heads do have powers to allow under exception rules.
@robjpLFC I think it's hard to define as there are some times when it is particularly difficult and damaging to a child to take them out.
@robjpLFC when I was a teacher. We had some taken out for weeks. Clearly wrong. Now, we have reasonable request refused. Also worng
@robjpLFC I've always said its a parents right so long as reasonable, not too long and not at inappropriate time, EG exam etc etc
@JohnMannMP What's 'The Observer' John?
@EdwardSargeant1 Aye, it were good!
Thanks to CF for help today. And the dog too in the photo! Great weather too. http://t.co/qve09uZvUz
@LeonSeanFrench I literally died after reading that!!
Great day I meant not deal.
Great deal over all. So proud our jobs fair today got people jobs! Well done to my office staff, jobcentre plus and Goole College for effort
Good evening at our fundraiser in Epworth. Was able to rally the troops and warn of Labour's increasingly personalised campaign locally.
Good meeting at Westfield Banks..  Council officer explained how what I assumed would be a solution,road classification, cud make it worse!
@waggy000 how do you know. You didn't ask me. Let's not be silly about it eh!
@VictoriaMumby you asked me how to clarify it and what was correct to say! Dear me. Anyway, I'm with residents so please leave us to it.
Just had so many people stop and chat in Goole today. I think the sun has put us all in good mood.
@VictoriaMumby  doesn't change the fact several of you have had to, two had to apologise for their smears and lies. We haven't cos we don't!
@waggy000 did u ask? Did anyone ask then? No? Perhaps you should have bothered to!
@VictoriaMumby nope u had to clarify and accept what you was incorrect. Why lie in the first place? More lab bullying locally.
@waggy000 my concern is it promotes bigotry and ignorance. I make the same comments about Tory MPs with the same views as UKIP.
@waggy000 because it's a managed condition! It's hardly Ebola!
One of the employers at the careers event today has just told me they have already recruited more than one person. The event is till 3pm.
We're open from 11-3 today with the opportunity to talk to local employers, training providers & voluntary organisations.
Great turn out already for the Help Into Work event that I'm hosting at Goole College today! @hcuk_goole http://t.co/vipXAnajXn

@martin_mpd lol. It's haggis tonite. Back on the kebabs next week!
So, apparently I was the only First Responder who screamed out when we got our flu jabs tonight @YASCFR ! Re-qual done also tonight. #nhs
@yorkierosie no its one long reel of me doing things, with photos of me doing things. #labourfail
Potato even!
I'm cooking Haggis for tea tonight. In celebration of #bettertogether. Except with pumpkin and sweet potatoe!
Labour used college for a cheap photo opp today. I'll be using it tomorrow to actually do good for local people through our careers event.
I hope he got to hear about the nearly ¬£1m investment recently given to the college by the Conservative led government. 2/2
Delighted that the Shadow Education Secretary visited Goole College today as I was informed some weeks ago. 1/2
Just finished filming Hot Topic for @EstuaryTV & now on route for first responder training and flu jab.
@TheBeatlesLady I was told by a local Lab activist that they find I'm well liked on the doors so were planning months of character assas!
@cwsp119 thanks I think. Lol
@RobJefferson Absolutely, hence my literature locally is always positive. Cheers.
Anyway, in more positive news our doorstep and telephone canvassing continues to bring in some cracking returns. Even Lab voters backing me
They can attack me all they want, it only drives me to go on and campaign harder. I won't have my staff bullied by them tho.
Worst of all though is the attempt to bully one of my staff members recently, simply because she works for me. Labour should be ashamed.
As local residents know, Labour always campaign negatively locally. Thanks to local residents who see through this nasty campaigning.
So far, and the election hasn't even started yet, 2 Lab Cllrs had to apologise, 2 remove tweets and a Winterton Lab remove tweets.
Shame  Labour locally are continuing to w/nasty campaign of character assassination. They keep having to apologise to us for their smears.
Open to anyone interested in speaking to local employers, volunteer organisations or training providers. Also mock interviews available.
Don't forget I'm hosting a Help Into Work event with Jobcentre Plus tomorrow between 11-3 at Goole College. http://t.co/LzPPzUCyG6

@kasslee24lfc no worries. Pleased to help.
We've been delivering letters to residents today asking for support for the scheme. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if interested.
Teamed up with GPs in Rawcliffe to provide a 24h Public Access Defib there. They are supplying defib & we're raising money for the cabinet.
Meeting at Goole Hospital with MIU staff & Trust lasted longer than planned. Not sure outcomes are necessarily clear as yet so more to do!
@barryjack can't with with road works I'm afraid. Council does works people complain, council doesn't do works, people complain.
Afternoon was busy in a Brigg office getting stuff sorted for the campaign. This evening had a campaign planning meeting. Good day!
Just attended petition hearing with residents from Parklands to support their call for a safe crossing point.
@robgawthorp it's possible, your boys have been impressive so far I think.

First meeting was in Epworth. Now in Scunny to open the Mental Health Collaborative event.
@robgawthorp yer, don't we know it. Was an awful game and the Pats ain't exactly been inspiring so far this season
These two are not connected I'm sure. But I booked on @YASCFR duty and now wide awake!
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby Just today I was alerted by someone else working for another organization of this bullying from Lab locally.
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby I understand the culture of bullying may extend beyond ourselves. Expect to see more on that in coming months
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby when challenged they try and turn it back on us but it's their Cllrs who keep having to apologise, not us
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby the local Lab party have pattern of threats, insults, bullying. I've still got the deleted tweet from one
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby a 16 year old student observer with us was offered out for fight by a labour member present. Disgusting.
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby indeed Vicky herself had to remove incorrect tweets about me recently. It's a bullying pattern
@Bill_Cheetham @VictoriaMumby @PaulMccartan1 pattern of behaviour Bill. Hence two Lab Councillors had to apologise to me for lies.
@tonybig cheers. Yes on CFR duty this evening.
@tonybig @BriggFC it's brigg.goole@gmail.com
@lunguk will look at it.
Turns out my Spence ancestors were some of the earliest inhabitants of Goole, living in Ouse Street. Dock labourers so close to work place!
Also had a great deal going through archives as part of my research into family tree. Took an afternoon off to do it.

@CoreyJoe_ I think your BPLS experience would be enhanced by coming campaigning for me. Next Saturday?
Sorry to have missed Brigg Civic Service. Two main reasons. Still in bed from last night and no car due to MOT fail!
@tehreedy that may have gotten me in bother!
@uncleporkie along with health care workers, often overlooked when we praise NHS staff.
Oh and great with patients too. Dealt with them with humour and professionalism which patients all appreciated.
Truly say @YorksAmbulance have some amazing staff working for them. Thanks to Gail and Andy my crew mates last night. Lovely people.
Slept a bit after last night's shift w/Amb Service. Best comment was at 4am this morn in patient's home, 'Is this all part of MP service'.

Good to get action on foreign registered vehicles avoiding the law! I first raised this in Parl back in 2012!
Sunday Express reporting on new government measures to deal with foreign vehicles in the UK dodging law. Nice of them to credit me with it.
Still at it. Shift ended at 6am but got a late call. Now off to York Hospital again!
Third hospital of the night. This time Scunny.
Back at it after a short break stop. http://t.co/IfBsnyrgVy

We are now at Goole Hospital Minor Injuries after transporting a lovely old boy here from the town. A right character.
@gavbroadhead @robgawthorp not sure they give that out do they?
With one of our Goole Ambulance crews. Forgot to say that. First call was Selby, now back to Goole on blue lights.
Off to the next call now on the blue lights! Bone shakers these ambulances!
@KevinMorton1966 they're on a dNR. Do not resuscitate.
Could be tricky this evening with Scunny hospital declaring major incident due to that burst water main near hosp.

My first job helping was to empty a full sick bowl! Lovely!
Currently at York Hospital where I am with one of @YorksAmbulance crews. Have joined them for a shift.
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 We've acted when Labour refused to. We'll have none of their hypocrisy!
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 there was a massive rise in the use of these loan companies under Labour who did nothing to regulate them.
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 Besides Bill it is the Tory Govt that is bringing in the tough new laws on this sector after Labour did nowt.
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 Bill, don't knock them, their campaigning style locally is a major reason we will trounce them here in May n
@vinnymarshall can do. 36k doors to knock on tho so can't promise. Lol
@vinnymarshall we were out canvassing in Brigg this week.
Mis-count! 10 hardy soles made it today!
@andrewpercy
A hardy group of us have turned out In the rain for a spot of campaigning on the Isle. Only 8 of us this morn but more than I expected.
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 genuinely, they could struggle to get second place here.
This week's Goole Courier got in quick on our GP 7 day pledge. Made the front page! Part of the solution only tho! http://t.co/UpMQiLCFmU
@Bill_Cheetham @PaulMccartan1 They're getting such a bad response on the doors locally, they will resort to anything #Morley #fiddle
@roblaptoprob @lcfleming eventually most will in next few months. Some will get a different solution from next year.
@roblaptoprob excellent news. The roll-out is gathering pace now.
@robgawthorp if they halved the amount spent in one night on a bonfire they could do that!
@robgawthorp if Goole TC had anything about them, they'd employ local street sweeper like Howden and so many others do.
Love Goole directness. A guy just stopped me with the words 'Andrew what was that **** head Ed Balls on about the other day'.
Ended up hosting a mini-surgery in The Crossings tea room! Great to see some old friends.
Pleased though to see the new bin that ERYC have installed near the station/pedestrian crossing following my site visit with them.

All this defection talk, wouldn't it be funny if defection did occur but from Labour.

@MrSibs UPENN? I watched them demolish Princeton at basketball once.
@MrSibs and I just got tickets to see my @bengals shortly!
@MrSibs where did u live. I watched the Giants and Princeton when worked in the US. Oh and seen the awesome Clemson a couple of times.
I've realised I could never actually defect to another party like Mark Reckless as I refuse to pay to attend party conferences!
@benrathe @nfl_uk I must have gotten there earlier last yearr! Sucked!
@MrSibs yer. Poor game in many respects but always a good spectacle!
In fairness they piped down when I challenged them @PoppyLegion
Enjoyed the game. Didn't enjoy drunk poppy sellers on my tub train @PoppyLegion
Doughnuts, philly cheese steak and some beer and the game ain't even started yet! Loving @nfl_uk at Wembley. As ever!
Really not good closing the tailgate more than two hours before the game @nfl_uk
@Yair_Rosenberg disgusting.

@JohnTravis @JasonMcCartney is that a rough riders t shirt John?
Still lots of emails coming in to my request for resident views on the Iraq vote. Constituents in brigg and Goole are the best. No doubt!
@SheriffLonestar it is perfick.

@SheriffLonestar shall so do! And the tailgate before!
Actually, I'm excited to be going to see the Dolphins v Raiders game!

Great effort by the team in Epworth and Belton today. Sorry I couldn't be there myself.
@chris_1066 very kind of you to say.
"@chris_1066: Pity @andrewpercy  won't join UKIP best MP Isle of Axholme ever had" Hmmm. Thanks I thinks?
@FBureaucrat hey, don't quote me. Listen to mark rekless on august 29th who said onlt Cameron can deliver that.
I've always got on well with @MarkReckless and respect his decision. However, I fear he's just made an EU referendum much less likely now.
@chris_1066 no thanks. #bettertogether
@mcrobie71 @RosieBarton @PnPCBC the legacy of Iraq is why we had a debate. You had the good sense to avoid that one.
@BurgosIdrian @RosieBarton @CPC_HQ I know Canadian politics very well but best I not venture into domestic issues.
@BurgosIdrian @RosieBarton oops yes i did but thanks much.
@ButlerAndrewJ @hcnewhouse @PaulDoughty1 @RobertMcIlveen @chrisdsteward @ChrisWRowell @ConservativesYO @JHHsquawks so sorry we had this vote

Been to the funeral of Cllr Angela Ibson this morning. I was her election agent for two elections. A genuinely lovely lady.
Spoke at Goole Crime Prevention Panel this evening. Now replying to the hundreds of emails from residents on Iraq. Gr8t response to my email
@RichW426 ok I get a lot of complaints about speeding traffic. A lot. So I'm pleased they are taking action. Don't speed and it won't get ya
@RichW426 is that required. I thought they simply had to advertise their locations?
@jonwillchambers one was about regime change, this is about supporting the elected govt of a country and it's people. Simple
An excellent response from a resident. 'To me the nature of being British is to help people in their darkest needs'.
Best reply yet was 'In Andrew we trust'. Please no! Trust the other 649 MPs please.
@StewartHosieMP good luck. Do you want me to sign up to vote for you ;)
Am pleased so many residents have responded so quickly.
A definite change of opinion compared to Syria. I've explained to residents my own view is we were right to oppose Syria, but Iraq different
Big response to my consultation e-newsletter on Iraq vote. Lots of support for action from residents who last you told me to oppose Syria
@RichW426 it is there regularly so I assume it has the necessary permissions.
Visit to Goole Neuro Rehab Unit http://t.co/gMT6xwAusH
Looks like it‚Äôs good news on the bridge issue at Rawcliffe Bridge. I wrote to residents on this last week and will keep them updated.
Mass letter drop going out to Gowdall today regarding good news on the Hensall flood defences, which help protect the village.
Coffee & slice of toast in Epworth. When I went to pay I found out another diner had picked up the bill as a thank you for work on the Isle!
Life could not be better, just had to judge a cake making competition at Epworth Pre-school.
Am booked on @YASCFR @CFR_Yorkshire duty at last! #nhs
@jim_marr @NicDakinMP @rdash_nhs give them all our best and thanks for their work.
Good meeting with our local NHS ccg this afternoon. Pushed them on palliative care for Goole and discussed Ambulance services
@rotherycc of course!
@SnipeyChick as a Yorkshireman I think the best policy is to just never try to spend my money!
English Votes Summit with the Prime Minister http://t.co/3WIuzOM5Ng
Chaired the Isle of Axholme Flood Advisory group this morn in Crowle.
@Robertjha11 thanks. Really enjoyed it too
Tbh though, I had to do a Google search to find out that apparently Labour are having a conference this week. assumed it had been cancelled
The same people who took 160 million out of local hospitals thanks to Nicholson! Not forgetting the party that closed wards at Goole Hosp
So, we are supposed to trust with the NHS a party that cut 50k beds, closed Goole's mental health beds and cut spending in Wales by 8%! Hmmm
Great visit to Goole Hospital Neuro Rehab Unit this afternoon to catch up on their work.
Young Representatives Visit Parliament http://t.co/UaqYBxf5yl

Pleasure to present Jacob & Grace of St Norbert's School w/ the Communications Charter Mark on behalf of North Lincs http://t.co/IEXa5PIUU1
At St Norbert's Primary School in Crowle for a Q&A with pupils.
@lizzy630_liz we shall see. Needs to be done along with devo max.
@PeterMannionMP it's like u were there. Lol
@Dan_Kirke @looknorthBBC they could wwell come third here if our sampling is anything to go by. Lol.
Finally home but now have to drive to Hull for @looknorthBBC. A long way to Chequers
Finally home but now got to head to Hull for Look North. It's a long way to chequers!
Colleagues attending today were all in agreement. The vow made to Scotland must be kept and #EnglishvotesforEnglishlaws must be delivered.
For people who don‚Äôt believe I was at Chequers, I really was. Well, I got as far as the front door anyway. http://t.co/5I9PqM3Ctd
Good meeting at Chequers and I managed to wash all the pots up in record time!
@jameshoggarth yes, just left.
Politics Goes Pink for Breast Cancer Awareness http://t.co/MzgdoasptH
Perhaps I shud clarify. I'm off to chequers to do the catering, not attend the meeting :)
@anlabyandy I'm going to do the lunch.
@ShaunJClarkson English votes can be done to same timeframe. If it's good enough for Scots, why shud we wait
@ShaunJClarkson English votes for English laws can be done to the same time scale. Itss a simple change.
@ShaunJClarkson that's Labour's line to con the English. The timetable for Scotland was agreed by all.
Had so many supportive emails following Sunday Politics on English votes issue, including from East Hull.
On my way to Chequers to meet with the Prime Minister and colleagues, and also if I'm honest, to look at the big house!
@mallinsonlheart @TheBHF Cool. Keep me posted and we'll done to all today.
@Bruce_Panda the irony. No I haven't.
@lizzy630_liz thanks so much Liz
@chris_1066 true.
@Karen60Karen @andrewpercy thanks much.
Now in Hull to do the regional Sunday Politics for Yorkshire and Lincs. Grabbing a Starbucks first!
Good luck to all the @TheBHF walkers. At the Humb Bridge today http://t.co/MI6R2BUdJM
Good luck to all the @TheBHF walkers. http://t.co/KfpoYmbGYc
With Mr Hearty for a selfie at the Humber Bridge @thebhf walk http://t.co/1TuC1lGDJ9
What was interesting was unprompted, three residents raised need for English votes on English laws.
Genuinely warm response on the doors of Snaith today. Picked up votes from someone who voted Lab last time and two who didn't vote
@UKBest4Scotland to coin a phrase #bettertogether
@UKBest4Scotland both can be delivered together.
@CallumNash @ChrisMasonBBC heaven forbid the people of England who voted for a majority Tory Govt should actually get that. How dare they!
@CallumNash @ChrisMasonBBC No polls show massive lead for Tories on economy and spending and strong support for action on debt
@Jaggeroonie well it's too early to judge if it's a lie or a solemn vow. I think it will be delivered
@Jaggeroonie English voters mistrust WM politicians as much!
@Jaggeroonie A fair point perhaps but it must be now or else England will be left out for ever.
Late now for next appointment on the Isle!
@ruralred @ChrisMasonBBC @BBCNews Yes, it's all one massive well executed conspiracy!
50 mins I had to sit with Gordon Brown blaring down my earpiece at BBC Hull!!
@Jaggeroonie utter rubbish. I support devo max and will vote for it.
About to go on BBC news channel #englishvotes
@lizzy630_liz @bbcfivelive Thanks Liz.
On @bbcfivelive in tens mins discussing English devolution.
@karlmccartney on at 11.35
About to go on Five Live!

Really enjoyed being on the panel for the @UniOfHull sixth form question & answer session this afternoon.

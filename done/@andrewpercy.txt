@andrewpercy
Teams, out canvassing Goole today reporting lots of Lab last time now undecided. Mon Apr 27 17:26:11 BST 2015
@Sturgeon2013 thanks for support. Mon Apr 27 17:21:18 BST 2015
That's nice, a couple have just emailed me to say they've received their postal ballots overseas and have cast them for myself Mon Apr 27 15:18:41 BST 2015
@LordScunny But don't worry even Lab members in Winterton aren't voting for him. We've never had better canvass returns from Winterton Mon Apr 27 12:32:16 BST 2015
@LordScunny it was somebody else as it happens. They will do the same again. Mon Apr 27 12:28:43 BST 2015
@TMobileCust123 that's true last time people noticed the same and it did them no favours Mon Apr 27 12:27:40 BST 2015
Very angry Winterton resident has also called to say disgusted Lab have flyposted trees on council land with their posters. More dirty tacs! Mon Apr 27 12:25:13 BST 2015
Suppose you gott feel sorry for Labour. Nobody knows who the candidate is, they will lose by a huge chunk, so just start dirty tricks again! Mon Apr 27 12:23:10 BST 2015
In other news an 82 year old lifelong Lab voter just told me she had returned postal vote for me as she's never been so well updated locally Mon Apr 27 12:17:51 BST 2015
Wonder when they'll start stealing them like last time. Best ask the Lab guy from Winterton who attacked them last time Mon Apr 27 12:16:35 BST 2015
And so begins Labour's poster rule breaking. Come and put sign next to mine on private land they don't have permission for. As last time Mon Apr 27 12:15:45 BST 2015
So apparently, one of my big poster boards now has me with a beard and moustache on it. I'd expected something from my forehead! Gotta run!, Sun Apr 26 14:54:09 BST 2015
@lizzy630_liz @HollyMumbyCroft I'm still chuckling about that offering. Weird. Sun Apr 26 14:53:05 BST 2015
I am prepared to share with Twitter tho that I do intent to eat a caramel egg McFlurry today also. Over and out for the day now. Sun Apr 26 14:43:24 BST 2015
Done all the campaign stuff I'm prepared to on Sunday now time for garden and family. Two things I prefer to keep out of politics! Sun Apr 26 14:37:34 BST 2015
@lizzy630_liz @HollyMumbyCroft I guess I should open up my family album as they don't appear to have gotten a photo of me for the list ;) :) Sun Apr 26 14:32:30 BST 2015
@HollyMumbyCroft er Yer #obvs Sun Apr 26 13:43:06 BST 2015
A leaflet delivered six months before an election is worth two or three delivered during a campaign in terms of impact Sun Apr 26 12:26:10 BST 2015
Similar to what I heard in Broughton yesterday. I've always said leaflets in election time are the least effective for getting noticed Sun Apr 26 12:25:33 BST 2015
Lol. They also apparently had a fair few people ask if anyone else is standing here. Sun Apr 26 12:24:41 BST 2015
Big thanks to Ron and David and their little team on south of the Isle who have spent three weeks solidly doorknocking there. Fab results in Sun Apr 26 12:20:04 BST 2015
@EmilyElwes Brigg.goole@gmail.com Sun Apr 26 12:04:35 BST 2015
@scawbyhall thanks much, I'm still 25 so no senior moments for me yet. Lol. Sun Apr 26 11:54:23 BST 2015
@EmilyElwes hi there. Drop me an email please. Can chat on there. 140 characters not enough. Lol n Sun Apr 26 11:53:56 BST 2015
@paulverrico Great job. Really proud of your work and so shud you guys. Sat Apr 25 22:47:44 BST 2015
Great Last Night of the Proms concert in Goole thanks to the Lions. Well done to East Riding Wind and Jazz bands too http://t.co/q5hQYEPBjT Sat Apr 25 21:56:14 BST 2015
@badgerbod @HollyMumbyCroft whatever it takes. Lol Sat Apr 25 17:54:31 BST 2015
@KevtheSlug no bffs in my leaflets. This is a job not a celebrity position. As such I focus on issues and residents, not indulging myself! Sat Apr 25 17:51:42 BST 2015
Now off to a Last night of the Proms event in Goole Sat Apr 25 17:49:14 BST 2015
Good day on doors. Focused on canvassing undecided voters we called on few weeks ago. Those that have firmed up seem to be firming our way Sat Apr 25 17:48:43 BST 2015
Just had first 'that photo doesn't do you justice' of the day whilst canvassing. Sat Apr 25 15:29:29 BST 2015
Appalled to think that a member of the local lab team came on twitter to accuse residents of telling lies about postal ballot complaints Sat Apr 25 14:32:09 BST 2015
@HollyMumbyCroft you are too dedicated. Sat Apr 25 14:20:04 BST 2015
@scawbyhall hi yes just drop us an email to brigg.goole@gmail.com Sat Apr 25 13:48:18 BST 2015
Change of mind, prawn Marie on my jacket potato. Must be one of five a day in their somewhere Sat Apr 25 13:46:39 BST 2015
Big thanks also to these guys for their help a few days this week @JamesRGurd http://t.co/X0iSUhmR7N Sat Apr 25 13:44:33 BST 2015
Broughton team stopping for lunch. We seem to have lost the candidates though. http://t.co/JATJx7tsKg Sat Apr 25 13:35:33 BST 2015
@chrisknottmk it will be the Imagination Library I set up in Goole. It will be a bit higher than 4k but you still have to pay. Cheers much. Sat Apr 25 13:11:48 BST 2015
My target letter to Lab waiverers quoting local Lab MPs comments about my local work seems to be working a treat with Lab voters Sat Apr 25 12:59:56 BST 2015
@andrewpercy my only concern is Lab have a history of not paying their debts. :) will you pay? Sat Apr 25 12:57:19 BST 2015
Guy in Appleby just said to me 'No competition here. We've sent postals in.' they're now packing for their holiday to Spain. #welljel or so Sat Apr 25 12:56:43 BST 2015
@chrisknottmk 200. Will be a nice boost to the Imagination Library. I'll even pay you it my majoryt falls below. 4k. It won't. Sat Apr 25 12:50:52 BST 2015
@chrisknottmk Happy to do a small charity wager on result. Admittedly we do have polling data you don't. U keep wasting time here mate :-) Sat Apr 25 12:47:01 BST 2015
@AdamAllnutt a point many of the 1500 plus Lab people who told us they voted Lab last time and now backing us say to us. Lab turn up 4 elec. Sat Apr 25 12:41:25 BST 2015
@AdamAllnutt You aren't local so perhaps you can be forgiven for not knowing we've been there five years, not just appeared for election Sat Apr 25 12:40:01 BST 2015
To say the residents of this community are happy we've got them into the next phase of broadband roll out would be an understatement! Sat Apr 25 12:38:43 BST 2015
@AdamAllnutt it's a parliamentary office silly Billy. I know Lab like to break the rules and lie locally but come on! Sat Apr 25 12:37:56 BST 2015
@AdamAllnutt so that's the official Labour line. Throw mud when residents report potential breach of law. We know u r struggling but wow Sat Apr 25 12:37:09 BST 2015
Yet again we seem to have many more people out on the ground than Labour. People out in four wards. One person asked if anyone else standing Sat Apr 25 12:36:21 BST 2015
@KevtheSlug well this is awkward. How do I say this, you may not be my bff and as such, u may not be in my leaflets The lamb far more likely Sat Apr 25 07:28:02 BST 2015
@HollyMumbyCroft what did you dream? Was it about leafletting? Sat Apr 25 00:16:52 BST 2015
@johnleggottslt Great event today. Really well done to all involved. Fri Apr 24 23:43:05 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke thank you so much for the support Fri Apr 24 23:24:31 BST 2015

I've rewarded myself with a McDs! Fri Apr 24 13:53:23 BST 2015
@robgawthorp just make sure you vote. But not unless it's for me :) Fri Apr 24 13:52:16 BST 2015
Ofsted first thing followed by student question time. Both challenging events. Fri Apr 24 13:47:54 BST 2015
@adams_nick97 @vote4des @NicDakinMP Apologies for that, ofsted inspection took up time first thing. Fri Apr 24 13:46:48 BST 2015
Well done to @JohnLeggottColland students on their question time debate today with students I got stuck with Ofsted inspection so was late Fri Apr 24 13:46:14 BST 2015
No reports from our patch so hope all is fair and square and that the issuing of guidance to candidates across the area will help. Fri Apr 24 13:40:39 BST 2015
Good of the Returning Officer to act quickly on reports of postal vote collection we received from Scunthorpe residents. Guidance issued Fri Apr 24 13:40:02 BST 2015
@wroenaldinho @nationalgriduk still waiting for more forms back. One of the residents is taking some out to get more people signed up. Fri Apr 24 12:48:12 BST 2015
@steflumley thanks muchus Fri Apr 24 12:47:18 BST 2015
@courtss_coome @lewismaaate er thanks. Fri Apr 24 12:31:50 BST 2015
@BigGazLaw @p1bet actually we have over 1500 Lab voters who told us they voted Lab in 2010 say voting for me now. Fri Apr 24 12:31:26 BST 2015
@p1bet too kind of you. Fri Apr 24 12:30:50 BST 2015
Worrying calls about Lab locally calling on postal voters and asking to take their postal ballots away! We have reported it. Fri Apr 24 12:29:24 BST 2015
@DeputyBrownTX but possibly not? Or is it? Thu Apr 23 23:18:50 BST 2015
@DeputyBrownTX u shud get on one of those political shows on the Tele. Thu Apr 23 23:15:33 BST 2015

@sjb_hull @hel1958 #winninghere Thu Apr 23 23:10:22 BST 2015
Some opinion poll or something shows somebody ahead of somebody else, but others don't. Now that does tell us a lot doesn't it Thu Apr 23 23:09:47 BST 2015
@lizzy630_liz @tintodog 😃 Thu Apr 23 23:06:18 BST 2015
@sjb_hull @hel1958 I don't yet have the full black bin bag permanently in the car ready for a Focus leaflet, Thu Apr 23 23:05:54 BST 2015
@sjb_hull @hel1958 I think the people want to hear about pedestrian crossings. Hope you are both keeping well btw Thu Apr 23 23:00:08 BST 2015
@hel1958 lol. I can't think why anyone would giving a flying fajita about the former, so we'll go with the latter Thu Apr 23 22:37:11 BST 2015
Putting leaflet together for tomorrow. Can't decide whether to do a story about my best friend or one about the crossings we've secured Thu Apr 23 22:35:06 BST 2015
More lies in Lab literature saying the Tories have allowed unqualified teachers in the classroom. There were more of them under Labour. Lies Thu Apr 23 21:32:02 BST 2015
@IsabelHardman email us on brigg.goole@gmail.com Thu Apr 23 20:56:14 BST 2015

@Adrian_Pearson I can't. It's so awful. I just showed it to a drinker in the pub and they just burst into laughter. Thu Apr 23 20:45:27 BST 2015
Nice team meal in Epworth after canvassing tonight. Looking forward to two weeks tonight. Gonna enjoy putting local labour bullies in place Thu Apr 23 20:33:05 BST 2015
@janeybabes001 @katewezd So now they are bullying you. They are awful and I can tell you, they are going to be heavily beaten here. Bullies! Thu Apr 23 20:28:23 BST 2015
I've never seen an election leaflet that has a section about the candidates best friend. We can't stop laughing. Thu Apr 23 20:23:17 BST 2015
How fab that following my wheelchair challenge with @Jackmarsh_20 Martins in brigg are installing electric doors. I wrote to them to ask Thu Apr 23 20:18:32 BST 2015
Residents on the Isle told me this evening they liked getting my elec address with Isle of Axholme on their address. Thu Apr 23 20:15:23 BST 2015
Just had the latest Lab leaflet described to me by a resident as 'just weird'. I hadn't seen it. Just have. It is beyond weird to say least! Thu Apr 23 20:07:07 BST 2015
Stuffing factory! http://t.co/srvqwa1KHC Thu Apr 23 16:57:14 BST 2015
@Jack_Blanchard_ lol. #promotepercy Thu Apr 23 14:32:18 BST 2015
@lizzy630_liz there are a lot I see and we haven't actually even tried. Just people asking for em Thu Apr 23 13:49:22 BST 2015
@Jack_Blanchard_ well given a record number of new car sales haven taken place in recent years ya may wanna re think that one :-) Thu Apr 23 11:32:33 BST 2015
@Jack_Blanchard_ Car is from 2005 Blair's Legacy Thu Apr 23 11:18:40 BST 2015
160 quid to get a new bloody key card! Why can't cars just start with keys! Thu Apr 23 11:07:43 BST 2015
Goole has been a little gold mine of support on the doors these past few days. Given us a right buzz. Back at it having taken car to garage! Thu Apr 23 11:06:58 BST 2015
Team commented earlier on how few Lab posters there are in constit than last elec. But then, not a surprise given response we are getting. Thu Apr 23 11:05:01 BST 2015
And in other news I just swallowed a fly. #campaigndangers Wed Apr 22 16:48:47 BST 2015
a lovely lady just told me I should be awarded the Queens Award for Industry for working so hard for Goole. I've put her down as a possible! Wed Apr 22 16:47:54 BST 2015
@CFoI a joy to have you Wed Apr 22 16:47:06 BST 2015
@emilyrhiannon_ Schools should be able to accommodate both. Wed Apr 22 16:46:50 BST 2015
@Sturgeon2013 we don't stand for the Town Council. Labours politicization of it has destroyed it as a useful vehicle. Voting anything butLab Wed Apr 22 11:57:25 BST 2015
@econhedge @thecentreline86 Peter Mandelson said all that needs saying about this policy. Everyone knows it won't raise the money they say.. Wed Apr 22 10:22:16 BST 2015
@MikeOBrewer thanks Mike. Tue Apr 21 23:04:47 BST 2015
Labour committing more election offenses today. Claiming again Tories cut respite care in Winterton. It was Labour in 2010 who ended it all! Tue Apr 21 20:24:28 BST 2015
@RayMu93 I'm sure that's probably not legal Tue Apr 21 14:09:45 BST 2015
Lovely email from Isle voter saying attended hustings last night. Left as the other candidates were 'bland' and she didn't like the stacking Tue Apr 21 13:53:21 BST 2015
More amusingly the Labour MP using this slave Labour is none other than @tobyperkinsmp who was here supporting Labour locally Tue Apr 21 13:52:43 BST 2015
How amusing that Lab members asked me questions about unpaid interns last night and then turns out they're employing em Tue Apr 21 13:52:02 BST 2015
@RayMu93 lol. Very funny. No poster removing this year I hope! Hope you aree well. Tue Apr 21 13:18:29 BST 2015
@karmachamedeon quite! Sadly he wasn't! Tue Apr 21 02:01:46 BST 2015
@stephenjc77 yes indeedy. As u know I pop over regularly to NJ so I'll be by to say hi. Tue Apr 21 01:06:52 BST 2015
@SiBenny hi. Thanks for that. What is the pitch? Tue Apr 21 01:05:32 BST 2015
i found my Green opponent to be thoroughly lovely, a really nice woman. Don't agree with policies but she genuinely believes in them Mon Apr 20 23:22:39 BST 2015
Anyway, nothing too taxing this evening to answer and I enjoy those sorts of events so I still thought it was a good hustings. Mon Apr 20 23:21:50 BST 2015
It was fine but the same one five years ago had people who had attended to ask genuine questions, those people were drowned out tonight sadl Mon Apr 20 23:20:48 BST 2015
Enjoyed Ministerial visit earlier and a hustings tonight, spoiled though by party members stacking the event, including from outside area!! Mon Apr 20 23:19:41 BST 2015
@1neilmachen Pleased they arrived safe and sound. Mon Apr 20 23:17:37 BST 2015
@stephenjc77 I was unable to stay up for it. I prefer to attend in person though, as per other awards in Nashville! Mon Apr 20 14:15:09 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke Same old then. Weaponising the health service and talking down our local NHS. Mon Apr 20 12:55:32 BST 2015
Local resident just dropped a four figure donation in for the campaign! Same as Tony Blair gave Lab locally but our guy didn't invade anyone Mon Apr 20 12:53:27 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke is it full of nasties? Mon Apr 20 12:27:50 BST 2015
At least we can laugh at Labour's nastiness. One of team suggested I adopt 'Canada's Local champion' as my new slogan Mon Apr 20 12:15:33 BST 2015
@lizzy630_liz @jackycrawford They did the same last time Liz and are doing it again. Nasty and personal. It's their way. In their DNA Mon Apr 20 12:13:51 BST 2015
Oh no not forgetting the local blood donor told his blood is sold to America by the Tories and then sold back to th NHS. Nice Lab bunch here Mon Apr 20 10:56:26 BST 2015
Then lies that I'm off to Canada to live if elected. An interesting way to run a campaign! Mon Apr 20 10:53:13 BST 2015
We had lab telling a woman who's voting for me she doesn't care about the NHS and small business owner voting Tory, he would as he's selfish Mon Apr 20 10:52:47 BST 2015
If I ever heard one of my canvassers telling bare-faced lies about an opponent on the doors I wouldn't endorse it by saying nothing as Lab. Mon Apr 20 10:49:52 BST 2015
@althiaraj I've lived there before and I'll certainly be back in the summer. Thanks for the warm offer :) Mon Apr 20 10:39:23 BST 2015
Why @jackycrawford did you stand behind one of your canvassers in Old Goole, allow them to say I am emigrating to Canada and not stop them? Mon Apr 20 10:21:25 BST 2015
Shocking that my Labour opponent is endorsing these sorts of tactics on the doorsteps. Again, they must think local people are stupid Mon Apr 20 10:16:39 BST 2015
Last time they told residents I was moving to America and didn't want to win. So personal and so nasty as we were warned they would be. Mon Apr 20 10:14:41 BST 2015
Lab campaign gets uglier. An Old Goole voter just contacted me to say that canvasser with Lab opponent on door told him I'm moving to Canada Mon Apr 20 10:13:58 BST 2015
Looking at Labour's leaflets delivered today telling lies, we've clearly entered the 'dirty' phase a local lab member warned me about. Shame Sun Apr 19 23:36:35 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke yes new nuclear is commissioned and we've put money into a new tidal tech. It is a mixed policy, off shore wind, biomass CCS et Sun Apr 19 19:20:20 BST 2015
@craigawoodhouse @stephenkb @wallaceme I also enjoyed telling a very rude bloke who was clearly UKIP to sod off as his language was offensiv Sun Apr 19 19:04:58 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke They are for some, but the problem often is that canals don't offer the same drop off and pick up flexibility etc Sun Apr 19 18:10:19 BST 2015
@Granny_Day reporting it as an election offence. Sun Apr 19 16:00:04 BST 2015
We saw this last time, as I predicted, they'd get nasty as the election neared. Telling pure lies now it appears Must think people are fools Sun Apr 19 14:53:50 BST 2015
Labour telling lies in Winterton as we predicted. Saying we axed residential care in the town. No, they axed it when they ran the Council. Sun Apr 19 14:52:53 BST 2015
Gosh, I feel sorry for @iredalepolitics today. UKIp candidate shouty Lab candidate for Grimsby trotting out the party line religiously.Awful Sun Apr 19 12:00:38 BST 2015
@eleanorbox yes indeed it was. Others were out in the Isle and Burton. Sat Apr 18 23:03:44 BST 2015
@TheRealDevvo its in the next phase of the roll out which starts to run from the end of this year. Sat Apr 18 22:50:23 BST 2015
Not long since back from a fundraising concert in Goole for the end of life care suite we hope to get in place in the near future Sat Apr 18 22:48:24 BST 2015
@TheRealDevvo yes it is Sat Apr 18 21:59:53 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke their vo:te is soft. I had six ppl we canvassed as Lab previously in one street tell me they voting for me today. Same each day Sat Apr 18 18:49:45 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke they are struggling with their own vote locally, or so my leak in their campaign tells me. What we find here too Sat Apr 18 18:48:57 BST 2015
@RealWitan @craigawoodhouse I just agreed and said I hear a lot of people say he's very good. Sat Apr 18 18:36:24 BST 2015
Canvassed Lab switcher today who twice referred to 'that local lad Andrew percy' doing good job I pointed out that was me twice to no avail. Sat Apr 18 18:36:11 BST 2015
We've teams out in several wards today. Here is the crew out in the East Riding. http://t.co/uXcMWp7NGq Sat Apr 18 12:43:27 BST 2015
@garyhalkon they do normally issue notices beforehand and try to avoid this. Fri Apr 17 20:36:39 BST 2015
@garyhalkon the notice said 'essential works' so perhaps it was only just added in for some reason. Fri Apr 17 20:35:35 BST 2015
@garyhalkon I have no idea. They slurry sealed them and I noticed the same on Monday when I was driving through. Fri Apr 17 20:35:11 BST 2015
@beckymoose hi Becky, the decisions on those are made by the local clinical commissioning group and not by the politicians. Have lobbied em Fri Apr 17 20:34:39 BST 2015
@ShaunJClarkson hi shaun I tend to avoid signing pledges. They mean nothing. Remember the tuition fee pledge. I didn't sign but kept it Fri Apr 17 20:11:41 BST 2015
Good visit to a local school area to take questions from students about the election Fri Apr 17 11:51:38 BST 2015
Lol. Woman in Goole just told one of my canvassing team 'voting for Andrew, even though he is Labour'. Thu Apr 16 14:18:46 BST 2015
@chef_martyn @RobertLingard welcome aboard. I can't do much duty at the moment so great u r here. Thu Apr 16 14:18:07 BST 2015
@eleanorbox excellent news. I think the Green party and you could be very good friends. :) Wed Apr 15 23:19:47 BST 2015
@1neilmachen My ugly mug will appear in full technicolor through your door in near future have no fear. Cheers for the wishes too Wed Apr 15 22:54:04 BST 2015
@scottycash1974 Thanks. I've had a shed load of supportive emails and letters on that one since first appeared in paper a few weeks since. Wed Apr 15 22:47:30 BST 2015
@1neilmachen you should have had an In Touch or two. The others will be appearing shortly. I took a chance they'd go early so I waited Wed Apr 15 22:40:24 BST 2015
@carlminns Well Zac Pearson did try to run the Union blockade so... Wed Apr 15 16:23:09 BST 2015
Ivve seen two houses today with confederate flags flying. Somewhat away from Dixie here. Wed Apr 15 16:12:52 BST 2015
@GreenpeaceUK whole idea of a moratorium was to allow more time to consider concerns. Should pre judge it in either direction. Im consistent Wed Apr 15 16:05:57 BST 2015

Lots of support for Julie Reed on the north of the Isle today. Teams out canvassing in two other wards too as we speak. Wed Apr 15 13:06:28 BST 2015
@GreenpeaceUK i remember all those people who signed the tuition fee pledge last time, I didn't, but still voted against. Action, not words! Wed Apr 15 09:56:52 BST 2015
@GreenpeaceUK i tend not to sign these sorts of pledges as they mean little and are easily broken. I prefer to stand on my record. Wed Apr 15 09:56:20 BST 2015
@GreenpeaceUK I'm afraid this person would do as the party whips told them if elected. I have already voted for a moratorium in Parliament. Wed Apr 15 09:55:52 BST 2015
@robgawthorp I've raised with Ministers on several occasions Tue Apr 14 23:12:34 BST 2015

Retweeted that last poll as I loved all the lefties tweeting six point Lab lead last week, now rubbishing this one. Truth is, prob outliers. Mon Apr 13 15:28:50 BST 2015
Teams out door knocking in four different wards to do. I'm off to join one of this afternoon and then speaking at an event later on the Isle Mon Apr 13 14:23:48 BST 2015

@prideoftheisle it's crazy busy. Sorry for delay in retweets. Mon Apr 13 12:58:29 BST 2015
We are getting a lot of Labour voters say they will vote for me locally on basis of work locally, not cos I'm a socialist I hope. Lol Mon Apr 13 10:20:24 BST 2015
Haha. Lab voter called the office to wish me all the best for election and to say I'm really a good socialist but I haven't realised it yer. Mon Apr 13 10:18:58 BST 2015
Another campaign week!.  If we can average the numbers we did every day this week, we will have run out of stuff! Already well ahead of plan Mon Apr 13 00:41:13 BST 2015
@ChadJNewton did quite a bit of supply at the Vale in between schools. Always enjoyed it. Thanks for the kind words. I don't get maths! Mon Apr 13 00:39:37 BST 2015
@TimGatt Sounds too healthy to me. Sun Apr 12 14:51:02 BST 2015
Bumped into one of my former teaching colleagues at an event. Now live in the constit We reminisced over my pancake making with my Year 1s. Sun Apr 12 14:50:03 BST 2015
Be rude not to have a McDs between today's various constituency events. Sun Apr 12 14:45:46 BST 2015

@scottycash1974 nightmare. We should know soon whether we are getting a second one. Sat Apr 11 10:44:53 BST 2015
Excellent residents meeting in Burringham tonight. Lots of good luck messages and wishes too from residents. Really humbling Fri Apr 10 21:14:09 BST 2015
@RedSpuggy what's that comrade? The tweet didn't seem to be in reply to anything Fri Apr 10 08:36:52 BST 2015
@OfficialGinger1 @tigergibbo I've got to a bit of East Yorkshire too though so both north and south bank authorities covered in this seat. Fri Apr 10 00:04:52 BST 2015
@tigergibbo @OfficialGinger1 left of the bridge as opposed to right so not Barton but t'other side. Thu Apr 09 23:51:17 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke oops. Posted twice. Thanks much again though it is kind of ya. Thu Apr 09 23:11:10 BST 2015
So Lab locally have selected a Lab Cllr who used the C word liberally on Council email to attack us nd another Lab Cllr who did similar. Wow Thu Apr 09 21:18:15 BST 2015
@MRSKx @tombradley95 very wise! Thu Apr 09 21:17:01 BST 2015
@craigawoodhouse plus we canvassed a woman who used to be one of DC's constituents. We made her tell us who she thought was the better MP... Thu Apr 09 20:20:06 BST 2015
@craigawoodhouse I had an 88 year old man prove to me he could still do 20 press ups. And another woman told me I'd lost weight. Nonsense! Thu Apr 09 20:18:00 BST 2015
Not tweeting much for the election period though as that only tells the opp what we are up to. Good day today at few events and on radio too Thu Apr 09 18:27:48 BST 2015
canvassing is amazing this election. Everywhere I go it's 'we see you all year round' etc etc. So much cross over from Lab for local work et Thu Apr 09 18:26:53 BST 2015
@tombradley95 @MRSKx lots send them I don't. It's a bit patronizing like saying I've sent a card so you'll vote for me now. It's belittling. Thu Apr 09 18:15:34 BST 2015
@tonybig @simonharris3 im here every day at the moment. Wed Apr 08 16:50:53 BST 2015
@DonimoRooke week of April 21st they get sent out Wed Apr 08 16:50:21 BST 2015
Very proud that my proposer on my nomination form is a veteran of D Day the Arctic convoys and the Battle of the Atlantic. Thanks George Wed Apr 08 12:22:26 BST 2015

@DrRichardJWhite lol. I can see the health and safety issues from Airmyn! Wed Apr 08 02:27:59 BST 2015
@meggitt20 not if the SNP and Labour have more seats and do a deal. Tue Apr 07 22:12:18 BST 2015
@amandalpick I had yet again several Lab to us on the doors tonight cost of the local work. As did most of the team. Tue Apr 07 22:06:03 BST 2015
Amused to hear feedback of lab groveling to Ferry Road west residents they upset over a speed scheme. Wasted an hour or so of their time tho Tue Apr 07 21:04:59 BST 2015
@thecentreline86 they're a joke locally. People on the doors see that and keep telling us that's what they think Tue Apr 07 20:28:28 BST 2015
They think it acceptable to call our team 'cu#ts' on council emails, but someone does a spoof photo of them and they run to police. Pathetic Tue Apr 07 15:26:12 BST 2015
Funny how Lab get angry over satirical doctored photo by local twitter account but silent on their own candidates' vile personal abuse to us Tue Apr 07 15:25:18 BST 2015
@DrRichardJWhite apparently there is a defined spot beyond which it becomes NR! Couldn't make it up. Tue Apr 07 11:48:46 BST 2015
@DrRichardJWhite The columns were done by Northern Rail as they are their responsibility. They did them quickly and did a good job on em too Tue Apr 07 09:59:00 BST 2015
... I suspect a lot of people think he shouldn't have started those wars either. At least we know it's no referendum under Labour. Tue Apr 07 09:57:15 BST 2015
So apparently Tony Blair, whose money is being used to fund the Lab campaign locally, doesn't think we should have an EU referendum ... Tue Apr 07 09:56:14 BST 2015
@danielbyles @jameswhartonuk @AlunCairns @craigawoodhouse He promised I can be Alun's PPS. Tue Apr 07 00:00:38 BST 2015
@danielbyles @jameswhartonuk @AlunCairns @craigawoodhouse... that or just some mug who'll leaflet for him. Mon Apr 06 23:54:53 BST 2015
@danielbyles @jameswhartonuk @AlunCairns @craigawoodhouse I think James sees me as a mentor, a sort of personal hero... Mon Apr 06 23:54:21 BST 2015
@AlunCairns @jameswhartonuk @craigawoodhouse They all know him! It was a bit sickening tbh. Mon Apr 06 23:32:32 BST 2015
@AlunCairns @jameswhartonuk @craigawoodhouse the whips are all seeing. All I heard today was 'Oh James is such a good MP'. Even Lab voters!! Mon Apr 06 23:31:41 BST 2015
@craigawoodhouse @jameswhartonuk What an awful thought Mon Apr 06 22:59:50 BST 2015
@DrRichardJWhite @networkrail @northernrailorg @ianblee They always said it would take some time. We shall chase it though for you Mon Apr 06 22:29:40 BST 2015
@Jessopk @weaponwood I'll take it up with police and council Mon Apr 06 20:26:35 BST 2015
@Jessopk @weaponwood thanks for those. Who funded the park as I don't know. Mon Apr 06 20:25:59 BST 2015

@marklonsdale @WykeCollege I look just the same to this day Mon Apr 06 17:19:12 BST 2015
@weaponwood cheers. Email it through to me please. It's a shame a minority spoil it for the majority. Mon Apr 06 13:10:45 BST 2015
@weaponwood Hi there. I shall certainly take this up and see what I can do. Thanks for letting me know. Mon Apr 06 09:29:05 BST 2015
@pauldansheehan With 12 people here risk is there isn't enough gravy! Personal gravy boats are the answer. Well done on the chicken dinner! Sun Apr 05 21:03:05 BST 2015

@CllrAlanClark lol. Trust me. We will win this seat by more than last time here. It's Lab who were the cukoos here. Gone and they won't back Sat Apr 04 17:12:40 BST 2015
@CllrAlanClark trouble is Labour won't be nicking any jobs around here comrade. :) Sat Apr 04 16:44:07 BST 2015
Then a few doors up a lady said to me ' you have an East Yorkshire accent'. So I had to explain our odd constituency to her too. Sat Apr 04 16:39:29 BST 2015
In fairness I explained I too live in the Yorkshire bit, the lady replied, 'well at least you know not to shout about that round here'. Lol Sat Apr 04 16:38:59 BST 2015
One floating voter said to me 'well I won't be voting for that Labour woman, she doesn't even live in North Lincs' ... Sat Apr 04 16:38:31 BST 2015
Was reminded of the difficulties of representing two different counties today ... Sat Apr 04 16:38:01 BST 2015
@SirDickOfHearts I assume they think it's at their own supporters. They have a poor database here. Sat Apr 04 16:37:14 BST 2015
Nice email 'Labour have just delivered a postal vote form and letter to my door, can I have a Vote Percy poster so they don't come again.'. Sat Apr 04 15:38:01 BST 2015
Hmmm, I don't think I'll use the line, 'I'll put you down as a big C' when canvassing again. Just realised how it sounded. Sat Apr 04 13:24:42 BST 2015
Popped to Greggs. Stopped three times. Once to say thanks for help on a hedge, another to say thanks free parking and one to offer of help!! Sat Apr 04 12:41:07 BST 2015
@jogideon sadly Jo, this is how Labour are locally. They get personal and they bully. Sorry they've started on you too now. Sat Apr 04 12:22:10 BST 2015
“@MichDonohue: Out campaigning for @andrewpercy today” thanks much. Hope to see you later. Sat Apr 04 12:15:43 BST 2015
@marcelomigbazan im sorry to hear that. Keep trying though. Good luck. Fri Apr 03 21:24:15 BST 2015
@Got4wheels nobody has a clue who they are. Increasingly clear onthe doors, they have zero traction and credibility locally. Anyways night. Fri Apr 03 21:23:29 BST 2015
@Got4wheels they do rather obsess about me and a number of them have tried to bully me on social media for years. We just ignore them now. Fri Apr 03 21:22:49 BST 2015
Found time for a spot of @YASCFR duty this evening. #NHS Fri Apr 03 21:16:55 BST 2015
@Got4wheels just today I heard of a business owner who said he was pressured into having photo taken with Labour for a leaflet Fri Apr 03 21:16:19 BST 2015
@Got4wheels well given they're the ones who keep having to apologise to us for smears and lies, that is highly amusing They're awful bullies Fri Apr 03 21:15:02 BST 2015
It's interesting how many people who always vote Labour in Goole, simply can't this time. Interesting to hear why. Fri Apr 03 21:14:13 BST 2015
Also just picked up another nice email from Goole resident,explaining why he could not vote Labour in Goole this year, despite always doing! Fri Apr 03 21:11:45 BST 2015
In a tiny village earlier today, had two people walking dogs say to me, 'why do only the Conservatives bother to come here'. Appreciated Fri Apr 03 21:10:06 BST 2015
My leaflets currently being delivered in a Goole and Snaith going down well judging by emails. People appreciate the all year round contact Fri Apr 03 21:08:59 BST 2015
It's a bit damp out now. No canvassing on Good Friday as that would be rude, so early finish. Fri Apr 03 15:47:55 BST 2015
remembered my earphones so am leafletting on my own Team think I'm rude as I keeping taking rounds and running off on own! @zacbrownband now Fri Apr 03 15:03:45 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar I hope that's singing you are referring to! Fri Apr 03 14:25:04 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar I'm an awesome country singer... in my head. Fri Apr 03 14:12:02 BST 2015
Singing away with my earphones in whilst leafletting this morning. Tad embarrassing as a family were out in the garden. Fortunately all tory Fri Apr 03 14:07:38 BST 2015
@W2G2H @OliverCooper honestly, it is the best I've ever had it on the doors Mainly cos of the local work and constant contact all year round Fri Apr 03 14:05:31 BST 2015
Not watching but my twitter feed is full of all this leadersdebate nonsense. Oh joy. Rock on! Couldn't be happier. I may have to leave twitr Thu Apr 02 20:33:02 BST 2015
@hel1958 Turn it of Helena! It's not a presidential system here. Waste of time. Thu Apr 02 20:01:33 BST 2015
Asked one guy if he'd be watching debate tonight, he said, 'No, clashes with masterchef'. I won't be watching it either. Thu Apr 02 19:54:46 BST 2015
i am loving canvassing this election. Yet again tonight Lib and Lab voters coming my way cos of the local work and been here all year round Thu Apr 02 19:51:13 BST 2015
@Nick_Marwood Thanks so much. Thu Apr 02 19:20:34 BST 2015
@crylatt how funny. The Royal mail database might not be but they actually chose to put Humberside as their own office address on leaflets. Thu Apr 02 18:04:20 BST 2015
Amusing email from a Burton resident asking what Labour mean by the word 'communters' in their elec leaflet Thu Apr 02 17:10:03 BST 2015
More complaints about Labour's election address today. Use of Humberside, spelling and questions 'who is this person' all came in today. Lol Thu Apr 02 16:48:01 BST 2015

@thecentreline86 what an excellent graphic. You should come and join us on the campaign trail sometime. Be happy to have u on board. Wed Apr 01 21:50:22 BST 2015
@thecentreline86 posted yesterday to you. Wed Apr 01 21:09:45 BST 2015
We never attack their posters, so why they attacked ours is beyond me. Last time I followed one of their people attack them in three village Wed Apr 01 20:28:44 BST 2015
More poster requests. Wonder if labour will come and take them down like last time. I know this as I watched them do it, logged with police Wed Apr 01 20:28:02 BST 2015
Great night on  doors, got so many invites in. One man even asked if he could get a selfie with me as his wife wouldn't believe he'd seen me Wed Apr 01 19:45:30 BST 2015
I just don't get it if Labour are so anti zero hours contracts, why do so many Labour Councils use them. Surely not shallow election promise Wed Apr 01 16:53:47 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar and once beaten you won't see that Labour lot, or the others again in Brigg. Wed Apr 01 16:52:36 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar the only people who haven't just turned up for the election are the Conservatives. Lab, Lib, UKIP, just here for election. Wed Apr 01 16:52:19 BST 2015
@amandalpick that's very kind. I've just joined a group on the Isle to start next session of the day. Sick of the bloody wind Wed Apr 01 16:51:29 BST 2015
Canvassed an ex constituent of my neighbour @edmiliband . He was not complimentary about his previous MP. Voting for us as hears from us Wed Apr 01 16:28:21 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar honestly, I've no idea. My forms are being done for me. Lol. Next week maybe? Wed Apr 01 16:26:19 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar not sure really. People keep asking me on the doors, is there anyone against me. If there is, they've just turned up for it Wed Apr 01 16:02:42 BST 2015
@SheriffLonestar they've actually put it on their own letterheads too. I mean why. Anyone local knows not to! Wed Apr 01 15:24:41 BST 2015
So many emails and calls from residents to let me know they are disgusted Labour using Humberside on their election address mailings. Wed Apr 01 12:02:48 BST 2015
It's odd how Labour didn't seem so morally outraged by zero hours contracts when in power. They even allowed exclusivity clauses in them ... Wed Apr 01 00:46:27 BST 2015
These winds have really taken their toll on the Humber and Ouse bridges today. Tue Mar 31 21:30:34 BST 2015
@Grandadmorph thank you so much. It means a lo Tue Mar 31 21:30:07 BST 2015
Fab canvassing today. So many people just stopped me mid flow to say we'd got their vote on basis of all year round contact. Even Lab voters Tue Mar 31 19:16:11 BST 2015
Karl Turner in real trouble in East Hull according to poll posted by @angus_young61 Tue Mar 31 16:16:03 BST 2015

@TMobileCust123 she has actually put it on her own letter head as Humberside too! The ones from me will say East Riding or North Lincs Tue Mar 31 11:08:25 BST 2015
@joshualawlor won't find lies from us, just a focus on my strong record of delivering for our area. Unlike others I've not just appeared now Tue Mar 31 11:07:39 BST 2015
@joshualawlor they have grossly misrepresented the votes, and lied on the NHS and bedroom tax. Tue Mar 31 10:35:02 BST 2015
@joshualawlor thanks, I just wonder why they decide to lie in it. The other votes are opposition day votes, so are totally non binding. Tue Mar 31 10:34:37 BST 2015
@robgawthorp lol Tue Mar 31 10:34:02 BST 2015
@thecentreline86 indeed, Labour locally are so out of step with local people. They've really peeved off residents in Skippingdale. Tue Mar 31 10:33:56 BST 2015
Fortunately local people aren't stupid like Labour think. Tue Mar 31 10:24:29 BST 2015
As we have always said, Labour will play nasty here, they always do and the particular personalities standing locally, especially do. #dirty Tue Mar 31 10:23:40 BST 2015
@joshualawlor can you forward the email on to Brigg.goole@gmail@com as I will pass it to a lawyer. Tue Mar 31 10:22:50 BST 2015
Oh dear, Labour upsetting residents in Skippingdale last night and then today sending emails with lies about my voting record in. Tue Mar 31 10:22:27 BST 2015
@joshualawlor that should have been actually voted against, rather than casually. Lol Tue Mar 31 10:21:33 BST 2015
@joshualawlor in fact, it was Labour who created over 80percent of all private provision in the NHS so it is just their desperate dirty lies Tue Mar 31 10:18:13 BST 2015
@joshualawlor similarly, there was no binding vote on the minimum wage, and the NHS is not being privatized so it is a load of old lies. Tue Mar 31 10:17:34 BST 2015
@joshualawlor well given I casually voted against the bedroom tax it is a big fat lie. Tue Mar 31 10:16:56 BST 2015

@MarkSomers Alas not, I live in the real world. Mon Mar 30 15:55:31 BST 2015
One lady actually did an impression of Ed Miliband to me just now! She was clear she didn't want him as PM n Mon Mar 30 15:03:08 BST 2015

@Pauldbainbridge thanks Paul The polling and doorstep returns are fab so it's looking very good for us here. Nobody a clue who Lab r locally Sun Mar 29 12:09:36 BST 2015
Oh, I'm going to enjoy putting the next North Isle newsletter together, Labour have given us an awful lot to go at. Cheered my Sunday no end Sun Mar 29 10:49:41 BST 2015
@Pauldbainbridge do they pay them? Rumours abound regarding certain cosy relationships in the town! Sun Mar 29 10:48:35 BST 2015
They must literally think people on the Isle are stupid. Good job I've written to the whole area this week to point out Labour granted them! Sun Mar 29 10:46:11 BST 2015
Amusing also for them to say we need Labour Cllrs to stop wind farms on the Isle. It was Labour who granted permission to them! V amusing... Sun Mar 29 10:45:32 BST 2015
Lab telling lies again locally, putting out a leaflet in north of the Isle saying we have less (sic) nurses. We have 240 more locally. Sun Mar 29 10:43:55 BST 2015
@martin_mpd @jogideon lol. Taken just after we'd had lasagne. Sat Mar 28 16:26:07 GMT 2015

So, the others out in Alkborough just caught up me. I'd not made much progress. Possibly due to popping into the Paddocks for bacon sarnie Sat Mar 28 11:47:00 GMT 2015
Great night with friends and supporters on the Isle this evening. http://t.co/4fPiisvxAK Fri Mar 27 23:15:21 GMT 2015

Great to attend the formal handing over of the keys to Little Acorns pre-school group. http://t.co/8VMExoJwEv Fri Mar 27 12:47:38 GMT 2015
I've written to a number of villages to inform them about the superfast broadband rollout. Fri Mar 27 11:19:47 GMT 2015
Been at the signing of BT contract for next phase of broadband rollout. Many small villages in Brigg & Goole included http://t.co/ZOCcbq6eQm Fri Mar 27 11:18:54 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig yes, why on earth they chose to put it on their own address in their letterhead is bizarre. A local resident wrote to me with Fri Mar 27 00:39:29 GMT 2015
@shelaghfinlay no, it's what they've chosen to put in their letterhead for their own address! Fri Mar 27 00:37:27 GMT 2015
I'm not sure Labour locally should have got their official letter heads printed with 'North Humberside' as their address. #notaclue #labfail Thu Mar 26 23:46:37 GMT 2015
So, I am eating a kebab. This is not news. Thu Mar 26 22:00:46 GMT 2015
Will be dropping 1,000 update letters on flooding and drainage to residents in Goole tomorrow. Thu Mar 26 16:31:55 GMT 2015
Heading back home now. Really odd atmosphere in Parliament, people leaving and saying goodbyes, others unsure they will return, some won't. Thu Mar 26 16:17:47 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig irrelevant as an issue to real people so prefer to comment no further. Thu Mar 26 16:17:13 GMT 2015
@Adrian_England hardly, I didn't agree so didn't vote for it. Thu Mar 26 16:16:35 GMT 2015
Awkward moment, rang to block a card I've last. The card people confirmed last transactions as McDonalds! Thu Mar 26 14:13:14 GMT 2015
@Cumpedelibero @NadineDorriesMP Yer but in the real world, nobody gives a flaying ..... Thu Mar 26 14:12:24 GMT 2015
@kellmano9 @craigawoodhouse not at all. I didn't vote as it was silly on both sides so I accept your apology on that one. Thu Mar 26 14:11:43 GMT 2015
@IsabelHardman I didn't vote! Thu Mar 26 13:37:34 GMT 2015
Scenes from the Commons stupid. Could it be anymore removed from the public than people clapping and screaming over how to elect a Speaker. Thu Mar 26 13:34:47 GMT 2015
@DanielOlivePol not really marginal. I'm here in The Westminster office! But not taking part in the vote. Thu Mar 26 12:59:32 GMT 2015
@JasonGroves1 true dat. Although the Labour fake outrage has nearly tempted me to vote for it! But I'll resist and stick to doing work instd Thu Mar 26 12:58:38 GMT 2015
@DanielOlivePol I don't care how we elect them. Whole thing is stupid. This fake outrage by Labour has nearly made me vote for it though... Thu Mar 26 12:57:54 GMT 2015
The fake outrage by Labour, the choice of timings, the hyperbole in speeches. Chamber rarely looked more removed from the public than this!, Thu Mar 26 12:50:10 GMT 2015
I'm pleased I'm not in the House of Commons debate on election of Speaker motion. It's turned into a fricking joke. Stupid on all sides Thu Mar 26 12:49:19 GMT 2015
Some of our smaller communities will receive a letter from me in the next few days, good news on an issue many have contacted me on in past Thu Mar 26 10:24:06 GMT 2015

@thecentreline86 @BBCPolitics was awful. Really the worst I've seen Ed. Prime Min was on fire today. Wed Mar 25 18:51:23 GMT 2015
Helpful though as it reminded one resident they need a postal vote. He said 'only useful thing Labour ever done locally'. Thanks much Labour Wed Mar 25 14:27:18 GMT 2015
Labour don't seem to be doing a very good job on their targeted postal vote letter locally. Sending it to people voting for me! Very odd way Wed Mar 25 14:26:10 GMT 2015

@DavideSands no no. Norman Shaw North. Wed Mar 25 00:31:29 GMT 2015
Just had conversation with one of the fab peeps who clean our office floor about mice. I thought we were safe on fifth floor. Seems not! Tue Mar 24 23:53:48 GMT 2015
@Iain_33 naughty to offer out jobs when proper polling shows no chance at all of winning Tue Mar 24 23:48:57 GMT 2015
@Iain_33 oh pretty good info from concerned family member. Tue Mar 24 23:47:24 GMT 2015
The same people who made a stink about work experience, now saying to unemployed people locally, work for free and no job at end of it. Ouch Tue Mar 24 23:46:42 GMT 2015
Alarming story heard this evening of one of my opponents offering out jobs already on condition they work for free for next few weeks! Tue Mar 24 23:45:53 GMT 2015

@jacobpbrazier not sure. If a constituent drop me an email and I will check. Fri Mar 20 23:08:49 GMT 2015
A truly disgusting sign of Labour's desperation. Literally making it up on the NHS now. Blocked our Health Cttee report, in favour of scares Fri Mar 20 21:02:32 GMT 2015
How dare the Labour Party, who have cut the NHS in Wales and opposed our extra money for England, accuse us of planning to cut the NHS Fri Mar 20 21:01:20 GMT 2015
I enjoyed opening Broughton Wellbeing Hub and Youth Centre tonight. All moved into the former Infant School site we saved for the community Fri Mar 20 20:03:31 GMT 2015

Also, I've just been at an @East_Riding broadband meeting with neighbour MPs Greg Knight & Graham Stuart to discuss the local roll-out. Fri Mar 20 14:06:44 GMT 2015

Picture from last night's fantastic defib training session in Rawcliffe. Thanks to @liveshq & all the residents! http://t.co/5mW5Rw1FN5 Fri Mar 20 10:08:34 GMT 2015
Sadly our local Labour MPs seem intent on talking the region down because it suits their own political agenda. They should support the area! Fri Mar 20 09:23:29 GMT 2015
Also great to see that Yorks and N Lincs created more jobs last year than were created in the whole of France! Fri Mar 20 09:21:42 GMT 2015
Great to read that the North grew faster than the South last year. Re-balancing the economy after years of a growing divide I under Labour. Fri Mar 20 09:21:06 GMT 2015

Three different people, one from Goole, one from Gowdall and one from Brigg. Very nice. Thu Mar 19 14:12:07 GMT 2015

@AL1CEPERRY @dunkindonutsUK it is. I bring it back with me each visit. Thu Mar 19 13:31:55 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig on train back so not sure. A bit dull on way up to be fair! Thu Mar 19 13:26:22 GMT 2015
Life couldn't be better. Just discovered @dunkindonutsuk is back in UK. Will their coffee be on sale here too? http://t.co/EgJmTFMO8T Thu Mar 19 13:25:26 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig me too the mute button is a great invention though Thu Mar 19 13:22:45 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig indeed. That's why you won't be muted. Lol. Thu Mar 19 12:52:10 GMT 2015
@CurranPadraig indeed, not all, some. We have some very negative campaigning from Lab locally. Doesn't wash with the people! Thu Mar 19 12:06:18 GMT 2015
@simonpeterfirth yes and had some v positive emails from residents too, mainly pensioners with annuities! Thu Mar 19 12:05:50 GMT 2015
@northernlennon such negativity won't win you any votes. Thu Mar 19 11:59:53 GMT 2015
@simonpeterfirth already getting it in the programme Thu Mar 19 11:59:12 GMT 2015
@Bill_Cheetham @KallumMcIntyre I think Kallum was probably told to attack me, it's all Labour Have locally. They must have polled the seat!! Thu Mar 19 11:58:47 GMT 2015
@KallumMcIntyre the Labour campaign locally is annoying and nasty, that's what I respond to. A threat, it most certainly ain't. Sorry for u Thu Mar 19 11:57:56 GMT 2015
@KallumMcIntyre feel free to pop in my office and we shall show you the grovelling apology letters from Labour locally. Why so nasty? Thu Mar 19 11:57:24 GMT 2015
@KallumMcIntyre what I hate is the nastiness of Labour locally, they are the people who keep having to apologise for smearing me, not me! Thu Mar 19 11:56:48 GMT 2015
@KallumMcIntyre oh Kallum, did somebody tell you to tweet that? Trust me, it won't even be close here. Poll the seat and you will see. Thu Mar 19 11:56:08 GMT 2015
Local village who were not in first phase of superfast broadband rollout have now been included in upgrade plans. Writing to residents today Thu Mar 19 11:56:02 GMT 2015
Local Labour Cllr found guilty of nine fraud charges I see! So that's on top of their former Council candidate and ex MP Elliott Morley here Thu Mar 19 11:05:02 GMT 2015
So women voters according to Lab locally, are so fickle, their only consideration is gender of candidates. Incredibly patronising to them eh Thu Mar 19 11:03:06 GMT 2015
Reported to me also a local Labour Cllr saying to somebody, 'oh Yer all the women will vote for our candidate cos she's a woman'. Incredible Thu Mar 19 11:02:16 GMT 2015
You can tell there is an election coming, Labour locally rubbishing electrification to Hull and extra trains to Leeds. Shame on them. Thu Mar 19 11:00:54 GMT 2015
Worrying that Labours view locally seems to be, don't bother, it's all too late. Wonder what the franchise bidders looking at this would say Thu Mar 19 11:00:07 GMT 2015
Silly letter this week in the Goole Times, from a local Labour member, now moved away, rubbishing efforts to get extra local  train services Thu Mar 19 10:59:35 GMT 2015
@RebelRevell indeed!! Wed Mar 18 21:34:57 GMT 2015
I sometimes think Labour locally just think people are thick. Wed Mar 18 21:30:11 GMT 2015
Yet a further example of Labour's deeply nasty campaign. Anyone who doesn't support them just doesn't care. Wow. Desperate stuff Wed Mar 18 21:29:11 GMT 2015
Interesting approach by Labour on the doors, telling people who say they are  voting for me, they 'don't care about the NHS'. Wed Mar 18 21:28:42 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart Indeed, the 'secret NHS cuts' line is one of the most desperate Ive heard. Wed Mar 18 19:24:12 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart MAnagement and admin costs far less now than under Labour too, meaning more money freed for patient care Wed Mar 18 19:17:26 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart Now dare to claim they want more money for the NHS. They opposed the £40 billion extra we have put in since 2010. Every penny. Wed Mar 18 19:17:01 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart we also asked if after being excluded, other countries could challenge it. Response was a very clear and simple 'NO'. Very clr Wed Mar 18 19:12:12 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart We received no evidence to the contrary, only opinion. Same way as all our other trade treaties have not impacted on the NHS.. Wed Mar 18 19:08:59 GMT 2015
@grahamstuart Absolutely, EU and US negotiators confirm it, it is the effect of all EU trade treaties since 1995, NHS excluded from it fully Wed Mar 18 19:06:44 GMT 2015
@SimonPhillipsUK @thecentreline86 @BBCNews Ouch!!! Wed Mar 18 18:55:05 GMT 2015

@iancawsey Yer, that's true! It's quite a different experience as the incumbent! Wed Mar 18 16:34:39 GMT 2015
@thecentreline86 yes so long as you are a lower rate taxpayer you can receive up to 1k in savings interest tax free Wed Mar 18 16:33:45 GMT 2015

So we've seen Labour's campaign plan played out, lies about 'secret NHS cuts'. Scaring the most vulnerable with disgusting lies. Shame Wed Mar 18 13:53:00 GMT 2015
Appalling stuff from Milliband claiming there is a secret plan to cut NHS. Absolutely desperate stuff. Only cut is in Wales under Labour Wed Mar 18 13:51:04 GMT 2015
Good to see Cancer survival rates in North Lincs improved last year, along with East Riding, now above national average. Wed Mar 18 13:49:12 GMT 2015
Labour MPs visibly embarrassed by this performance from Milliband, even the rehearsed jokes falling flat. Wed Mar 18 13:45:33 GMT 2015
Milliband talking about the North is hilarious, so few Labour MPs from the North actually come from the North! Wed Mar 18 13:43:23 GMT 2015
Odd of Milliband to talk about local,Government funding in the north when he has said there would be no extra money for local govt under Lab Wed Mar 18 13:43:01 GMT 2015
We see at Health Cttee week in week out, Lab members only interested in they can criticise govt and weaponise the NHS. Shame on them. Wed Mar 18 12:17:50 GMT 2015
So weak Miliband raises NHS just days after his own MPs blocked a Health Select Cttee report because, according to reports, was too positive Wed Mar 18 12:16:46 GMT 2015
Unemployment in Brigg and Goole for feb 2015 is 410 lower than year before and down month on month too. Much lower than what Labour left!!!! Wed Mar 18 10:48:22 GMT 2015
@RobertLingard they may be from a frozen Canadian lake tho Wed Mar 18 00:42:28 GMT 2015
@RobertLingard here are mine. http://t.co/AZ59RQhqUR Wed Mar 18 00:41:06 GMT 2015
Voted today to refer the fact they were held accountable by the media for this to the Speaker and Liaison Cttee. So much for transparency eh Wed Mar 18 00:38:26 GMT 2015
Health Committee minutes out from today, shows Lab members very unhappy that their decision to block NHS report was reported publicly! Wed Mar 18 00:37:30 GMT 2015
The Zionist Union clear winners at the event, Likud second. I cast my ballot for Yesh Atid. Wed Mar 18 00:19:45 GMT 2015

Goole Academy performance of Fiddler on the Roof was fab. Great singers and so confident. A pleasure to be able to say a few words at end... Sat Mar 14 20:25:41 GMT 2015
Just addressed a local public meeting. See how engaged they are. http://t.co/al1KrZ7jex Sat Mar 14 15:20:24 GMT 2015
@BMRowe81 @Conservatives In the fevered minds of local Lab lot probably not!!! Sat Mar 14 15:19:24 GMT 2015

Good team out in the Burton Ward today @Conservatives http://t.co/KaaFJuTdNu Sat Mar 14 14:10:51 GMT 2015
@DonimoRooke Yer, no harm done I guess. One constituent rang the office to ask why I was leaving Goole at the election. My staff confused!!! Sat Mar 14 00:22:23 GMT 2015
@DonimoRooke yes they made a mistake which is very funny given the article is apparently about somebody making a mistake. Highly amusing. Sat Mar 14 00:17:33 GMT 2015
Popped to see these guys doing a sponsored exercise overnight for a defib. Rock Fitness is Goole. Wow.Well done y'all http://t.co/OAKfD89mOZ Fri Mar 13 23:58:01 GMT 2015

@meggitt20 haven't seen that yet. Will look at it. Fri Mar 13 18:33:20 GMT 2015
@StevieH1972 or the complaint letters. You decide. :) Fri Mar 13 18:32:51 GMT 2015
@northernlennon I hid the addresses for obvious reasons comrade. Data protection! They address boxes are covered by other envelopes! Fri Mar 13 18:24:51 GMT 2015
Really busy in the Goole office. This is just this afternoon's letters! http://t.co/fQ5chhz5ab Fri Mar 13 16:46:04 GMT 2015
Very proud of that, means local residents making regular contact with us and trust us to take up their flooding concerns. Fri Mar 13 16:31:25 GMT 2015
Apparently, we contact the EA more than most on Constituent and local flooding issues? Hundreds of emails from us since last November Fri Mar 13 16:30:56 GMT 2015
Good meeting with the EA just now to discuss customer engagement and some local issues. Fri Mar 13 16:29:48 GMT 2015

@crylatt lol. Hope you are well btw. Fri Mar 13 15:16:23 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz Thanks for coming on board to help because of all the Labour hate spewed at me. Fri Mar 13 15:14:37 GMT 2015
@LeeGoodwinYork @hollygirl133 or apparently until in her twitter title. Fri Mar 13 15:14:00 GMT 2015
@colindavies14 The only place NHS funding has been cut is in Wales by Labour. We increased funding and will continue to protect it in Eng 2 Fri Mar 13 15:13:11 GMT 2015
@hollygirl133 Time you learned to spell 'not' too. Oh the irony. That was delicious. Thanks so much. Fri Mar 13 15:10:56 GMT 2015
@hollygirl133 I think the fact you can't bring yourself to apologise for getting it wrong says a great deal more about you than it does me!! Fri Mar 13 15:10:01 GMT 2015
@hollygirl133 @martintouche Er that's not my constituency. I think they've confused the wrong MP. Silly silly silly Fri Mar 13 14:05:43 GMT 2015
having a great time at Goole Academy and Studio School. Delivered talk on British Values to Year 11, then lunch with School Council and Q&A Fri Mar 13 14:03:46 GMT 2015
@dhemps in any event that was nhs care at a hospital serving nhs patients. No more privatisation than the company that makes nhs bandages!!! Fri Mar 13 11:46:08 GMT 2015
@dhemps truth is private patient income at FT Trusts now 0.9%. It was 1.5% under Lab. Not privatisation. Fact Fri Mar 13 11:44:38 GMT 2015
@dhemps done by Labour. Did u read the stuff about the alleged cqc report fiddle? Fri Mar 13 11:42:43 GMT 2015
@AaronLethem Thanks. Any evidence on demand is useful. I'm meeting another bidder next week. So any info u have great Fri Mar 13 11:29:49 GMT 2015
Must be good when even a Lab PPC is praising the big reduction in admin costs by this Govt, compared to rise in Lab yes. Fri Mar 13 11:26:53 GMT 2015
... This is amusing as it's one of the stats Lab MPs on our Health Comm vetoed us from publishing this week. Fallen faster since HSC Act. Fri Mar 13 11:26:02 GMT 2015
Amused to see a letter from Lab opponent in Goole times in reply to ukip opponent, crediting reduction in admin costs in the nhs... Fri Mar 13 11:25:13 GMT 2015
@dhemps The NHS budget is now over 12 billion higher per year than under Lab, private providers, who provide nhs care, at about 6 percent. Fri Mar 13 11:24:33 GMT 2015
@dhemps Hi, the only place the NHS budget has been cut is in Wales by Lab. It is also not been privatized Fri Mar 13 11:23:44 GMT 2015
: Been at Goole College again this am for a meeting, now off to Goole Academy to talk to pupils about British values Fri Mar 13 11:17:44 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz well if last nights canvassing in Burringham, Worlaby and Bonby is anything to go by, and the polling, we shall certainly do!, Fri Mar 13 11:16:51 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz No sign about that. In last week alone, lied about public health funding and lied about car parking at Goole Hospital. #weak. Fri Mar 13 10:59:44 GMT 2015
They had the opportunity and refused to turn up. I made the effort. Now having been shamed into it, they expect me to alter diary to re-do!! Fri Mar 13 09:44:35 GMT 2015
So having refused to take part in Estuary TV election discussion, some of my opponents now requesting it be re-shot. Bit of a cheek. Shamed? Fri Mar 13 09:43:16 GMT 2015
@AaronLethem that's my view too. They'd need to evidence with a demand study or something but my impression is a lot of ppl wud use it Fri Mar 13 09:35:53 GMT 2015
Great also to bump into my former Chemistry teacher who now teaches at Goole College! Some thought I was his former teacher, not other way!! Thu Mar 12 23:39:59 GMT 2015
This evening had a quick Governors meeting to attend too. Thu Mar 12 23:37:09 GMT 2015
Good visit to @hcuk_goole College earlier to launch new Construction Skills Centre http://t.co/4TTOvVtLBh Thu Mar 12 23:36:28 GMT 2015
@AaronLethem we won't know until the bids are submitted but it's encouraging the tender specifically asks for bidders to look at these lines Thu Mar 12 20:36:34 GMT 2015
Good visit to @YorkshireWater Carr Lane Pumping Station this afternoon to catch up with the ongoing works here. http://t.co/yGtD74lzOK Thu Mar 12 15:35:05 GMT 2015
More Trains To Leeds? http://t.co/eOoodltcXZ Thu Mar 12 12:01:33 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz enjoy. Laters. Thu Mar 12 11:51:41 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz it's an obsession, logged it all. After elec, it's all getting reported and I'm gonna take action against two or three of them Thu Mar 12 11:51:20 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz anyway, better things to do on a train than muse about that bunch of nasties. Country music to listen too and emails to reads! Thu Mar 12 11:46:45 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz There is a reason the lab vote hit a record low here in recent elections. They are more annoying than an electoral threat tbh Thu Mar 12 11:44:12 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz so do public judging by our mail bag! This candidate is worth a fair few extra votes for me. Thu Mar 12 11:43:40 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz indeed, one who attended a meeting recently with Lab opponent told me just a few months ago what a disgrace the selection was! Thu Mar 12 11:40:11 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz But that's no different to what some of those who appear in local Lab campaign photos locally have told us too :) Some often!! Thu Mar 12 11:38:06 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz a senior Lab MP yesterday who is involved in campaigns told me they'd written off B and G totally. Words were 'not a chance'. Thu Mar 12 11:37:10 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz It us a bit like all the playground bullies found eachother in our local Lab Party. Personalised, nasty, rude, bullying etc... Thu Mar 12 11:36:16 GMT 2015
That cud have gone so much worse. Train guard just said to lady with a big bump, 'How far along are you'. She replied 5 months Relief around Thu Mar 12 11:19:34 GMT 2015
Pleased to see the @EpworthB Bells reporting correctly this week increase in public health funding after my Lab opponents lies last week pap Thu Mar 12 11:13:56 GMT 2015
Finally on a train back home. Seems a while as I stayed down last weekend. Gorgeous sunny day Thu Mar 12 11:13:00 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles @brooks1985 amen to dat Thu Mar 12 00:27:05 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz did I pay you to say that? Thu Mar 12 00:26:29 GMT 2015
@RobertJenrick @CLeslieMP @IsabelHardman indeed, incredible of them to say we didn't want other evidence. We asked them for it Thu Mar 12 00:04:07 GMT 2015
@CLeslieMP @IsabelHardman @RobertJenrick More than happy for them to bring it back. They're the ones running away from the debate not us Thu Mar 12 00:00:02 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz sorry Labour logic. No Tele canvassing took place of course. Like this photo. Never happened! http://t.co/4aQaIEptbh Wed Mar 11 23:40:58 GMT 2015
@RobbieRJH and the point still stands. Wed Mar 11 23:13:02 GMT 2015
The only person we called who didn't pledge, was a number not working! Wed Mar 11 23:12:08 GMT 2015
Canvassing from Burringham this evening was amazing, I mean literally amazing! Wed Mar 11 23:11:30 GMT 2015
@RobbieRJH and then be held accountable at the ballot box Wed Mar 11 23:11:02 GMT 2015
@RobbieRJH Unlike your Mp, at least I actually bothered to ask my residents what they thought. And for that, I'm very proud. Wed Mar 11 23:08:49 GMT 2015
@RobbieRJH ah yes but when I'm not sure what is right, surely the only people to consult are my bosses. Wed Mar 11 23:01:55 GMT 2015
@KeeleyMP @IsabelHardman Barbara to throw it on us is outrageous. You voted to block us discussing your amendments. We asked u for changes. Wed Mar 11 20:57:08 GMT 2015
@disoye @KeeleyMP @IsabelHardman it wasn't one sided. It was based on the evidence and Lab hated the evidence as they prefer cheap politics Wed Mar 11 20:56:13 GMT 2015
@disoye @KeeleyMP @IsabelHardman Simple. Lab voted to block us discussing their amendments! They cud have written minority report. Shame. Wed Mar 11 20:55:48 GMT 2015
@CraigoBuzz not seen her tweets but yes. Wed Mar 11 20:16:16 GMT 2015
@oliversaxon Brd Paisley just download his Hits Alive album Wed Mar 11 19:02:41 GMT 2015

@oliversaxon she's married to Tim McGraw so she is very country! Her songs are a bit cross-over tbh but she's ok. Wed Mar 11 18:55:45 GMT 2015
@GarethKnight when we do our litter picks much of the litter is foreign cigarettes. Wed Mar 11 13:05:43 GMT 2015
Interesting. Overwhelming majority of comments on plain packaging against it, but some important points in favour too. No idea how I'll vote Wed Mar 11 12:43:10 GMT 2015
@SoleCrowleSoul all except Cabinet 7 will be done. Live v shortly at long last Wed Mar 11 12:41:41 GMT 2015
Times reporting today how Labour MPs blocked our Health Comm report on NHS funding because it didn't support their claims on privatisation Wed Mar 11 12:00:55 GMT 2015
That evidence was clear, no mass privatisation occurring, no extension of charging, admin costs falling, no threat from TTIP. Shame on Lab!! Wed Mar 11 11:59:53 GMT 2015
Only incorrect piece in Times column is that our Chair abstained, she didn't, she couldn't vote as Chair can only vote in a tie at committee Wed Mar 11 11:59:02 GMT 2015
As such they block they report. Only interested in the NHS if they can use it for politics. Shame on them. Wed Mar 11 11:58:32 GMT 2015
The evidence we heard in the sessions was very clear indeed. labour members could find no evidence to counter the clear evidence we heard. Wed Mar 11 11:58:10 GMT 2015
@MattRedmore I don't think Lab Cllr should be allowed to call people cu#!s on a taxpayer funded email. Wed Mar 11 11:56:56 GMT 2015
@isla111 cheers much. Wed Mar 11 11:35:28 GMT 2015
Use of C word throughout,copying in senior offices. Disgraceful failure by Labour to act. Come on @NicDakinMP sort up your people out. Wed Mar 11 11:34:52 GMT 2015
Weak Miliband has failed to reply to Council Leaders letter regarding local Lab Councillors foul mouth rant at one of ours on Council email! Wed Mar 11 11:34:15 GMT 2015
Try again and this time get spelling right! Wed Mar 11 11:33:16 GMT 2015
Weak @EdMiliband_MP has failed to respond to our letter reagarding a foul mouth rant and bullying by local Lab Cllr to one of ours on email Wed Mar 11 11:32:48 GMT 2015

@lizzy630_liz was it not for the soundness and kindness of the people of B&G, this job really wouldn't be worth it. Lol Wed Mar 11 00:24:06 GMT 2015
@drjennings if it had been white tie , well of course I'd have picked one a several! Lol. #standards Wed Mar 11 00:22:05 GMT 2015
I wasn't exactly planning to turn up in a tee and board shorts! I was in suit! Wed Mar 11 00:16:19 GMT 2015
My Dad's managed to get to 70 without needing to buy a black tie, I ain't gonna start pandering to petty snobbery now! Wed Mar 11 00:13:40 GMT 2015
Needless to say I haven't attended the graduation event. What pathetic snobbery. I've done my 20 shifts in my own time. That's enough! Wed Mar 11 00:12:20 GMT 2015
I don't have black tie down here, and hate wearing it (so outdated), my office called to say this and I were told I should 'borrow one'. Wtf Wed Mar 11 00:11:35 GMT 2015
The. Tonight I was reminded of the petty snobbery of Parliament. I was due to attend the 'graduation' ceremony for the Police Parl Scheme .. Wed Mar 11 00:10:45 GMT 2015
End of an odd day Big bust up at Health Committee and an odd lie by Labour about our weekend campaign photo. Very bizarre and a little odd!! Wed Mar 11 00:10:11 GMT 2015

Althorpe residents will be receiving a letter from me this week, similar to Keadby last week re energy issue locally. Tue Mar 10 14:38:57 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles yes I've spoken with Grandads Shed about it already. On a number of occasions, that's where I tend to go in town. Tue Mar 10 14:35:07 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles I'd say the fresher food and choice at places like Grandads Shed will prevail. Tue Mar 10 14:34:06 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles I'm not sure they are that cheap compared to some of our locals tbh. We shall see I guess. Tue Mar 10 14:33:46 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles there are lots of high streets where both survive Tue Mar 10 14:32:34 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles hope not, only be the case if residents and consumers stop using them Tue Mar 10 14:31:15 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles Twitter freezing, tried to tweet, Costa will provide jobs I suppose. Tue Mar 10 14:30:58 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles important thing is, we have great local cafes like Grandads Shed, Steel Rooms etc. up to consumers to keep using them. Tue Mar 10 14:29:25 GMT 2015
@emmakatestyles hi there, there wasn't anything anyone could do to prevent them opening if they wanted to. Tue Mar 10 14:28:58 GMT 2015
@hel1958 quite. I'm a right tight wad! Tue Mar 10 12:04:17 GMT 2015
@RobJefferson which if u look at my tweets is exactly what I do. Can't let their lies go unanswered tho. Tue Mar 10 11:49:40 GMT 2015
@RobJefferson indeed. I was merrily going about my business. You will note they don't come from me! I have to reply to lies though don't i?? Tue Mar 10 11:44:52 GMT 2015
@RobertLingard know even! Tue Mar 10 11:43:13 GMT 2015
@thecentreline86 lol. Deal! Tue Mar 10 11:42:35 GMT 2015
Last word on the latest Labour nastiness, just proves they ain't cutting it on the doors, even their own voters not supporting them. Bless!! Tue Mar 10 11:37:51 GMT 2015
@lizzy630_liz genuinely, one of the nastiest people I've come across in politics. All a giant game to him. Tue Mar 10 11:36:22 GMT 2015
@RobertLingard but you can't have done. Nasty Paul said it was taken ages ago and he'd no, what with him being so great! :) Tue Mar 10 11:35:41 GMT 2015
Mind you the person who accused us of it does seem to be a bit of an attention seeker. I don't think he likes being ignored. I pity him much Tue Mar 10 11:33:55 GMT 2015
In the meantime, we've just got out on the doors and gotten on with the job of representing the area and working for local people. #contrast Tue Mar 10 11:32:18 GMT 2015
We've had them accuse us of lying about photos and the usual dirge of personalised and offensive tweets and posts. Wow, what a positive lot! Tue Mar 10 11:31:27 GMT 2015
So in the past few week, we've had Lab accuse constits who tweet nice things about me of being paid, we've had a Lab Cllr harrass one of us Tue Mar 10 11:30:52 GMT 2015
And the lady who stopped our team to say Lab had knocked on her door and she'd given them what for and could she help us can't have happened Tue Mar 10 11:29:44 GMT 2015
If u were one of the thousands in Snaith and Pollington area who we came to Sat and door knocked or dropped a leaflet, apparently we didn't. Tue Mar 10 11:28:54 GMT 2015
Apparently @RobertLingard the photo you took of the campaign day on Saturday in Snaith was a lie! #nastyLabour Tue Mar 10 11:27:16 GMT 2015
Apols if you were in this photo from Snaith on Saturday. according to Labour lies, you weren't there. @RobertLingard http://t.co/KMBoYfcdj6 Tue Mar 10 11:27:09 GMT 2015
No wonder, I hear from one of their team, they are picking up quite a few Lab voters saying they are backing me. They will get nastier yet!! Tue Mar 10 11:26:13 GMT 2015
@PaulMccartan1 Either evidence this lie or have the good grace to withdraw it. They're holding a leaflet that only arrived on Wed! Tue Mar 10 11:25:34 GMT 2015
You'd have to be half daft to use an old photo and claim it was for a different day! I mean come one! Shows how obsessed Labour r with us!!! Tue Mar 10 11:25:30 GMT 2015
... accusing us now of posting photos from campaign days that happened weeks ago for this Saturday! What an utterly stupid claim to make!!!! Tue Mar 10 11:24:52 GMT 2015
A local Labour member told me Lab planned a nasty personalised campaign locally. That's happened, now it is just getting bizarre to boot ... Tue Mar 10 11:24:07 GMT 2015
@PaulMccartan1 That picture was taken on Saturday by one of my team. This sort of nasty personalised campaigning and lies is disgusting. Tue Mar 10 11:22:51 GMT 2015

@ETVjamesdunn it's fine, they are wriggling. Very embarrassing for them. Thu Mar 05 22:19:41 GMT 2015
@MarkSomers if they lose 30 to 40 seats to the SNP, I suspect their views might change n Thu Mar 05 21:44:25 GMT 2015

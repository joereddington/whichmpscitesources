Ed finishes by a direct challenge to Dave Cam. Will he debate now one to one? Yes or No? Thu Apr 16 21:30:27 BST 2015
So - who lost the debate? Only one loser:    Mr Cameron. Thu Apr 16 21:25:50 BST 2015

that Cameron will be PM in a Tory-led Government Thu Apr 16 21:22:15 BST 2015

Farage attacks the audience. Thu Apr 16 20:35:04 BST 2015
Cameron won't debate because the 
Tories are planning cuts that are "much more severe" 
than "anything we've seen in the last 5 yrs".(obr) Thu Apr 16 20:31:05 BST 2015
Farage is backing Cameron: UKIP back Tories' extreme 
spending plans - experts say this means a "sharp 
acceleration" in cuts. Thu Apr 16 20:22:38 BST 2015
Ed Miliband: "The real danger for this country is from a 
re-elected David Cameron who will double the 
spending cuts". Thu Apr 16 20:21:25 BST 2015
Where is the PM? Absent and afraid. Thu Apr 16 20:09:42 BST 2015

#leadersdebate The format had 7 leaders. But there is only one choice. Do we want more of same or better future? Only Ed can deliver change. Thu Apr 02 22:30:07 BST 2015
#leadersdebate we will end exploitation of workers in zero hours contracts Thu Apr 02 21:49:11 BST 2015
#leadersdebate Invisible Cameron out of his depth in this second half. No wonder he is chickening out of debate with Ed Thu Apr 02 21:46:52 BST 2015
Cameron having a nightmare second half. Can't remember one thing he has said #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:42:03 BST 2015
How does Cleggy's brain work? Does he really think that we all forgot that he was Deputy Prime Minister for the last 5 years. Thu Apr 02 21:37:53 BST 2015
#leadersdebate Tories:  tripled tuition fees, fewer apprenticeships, declining house building. Abandoned a generation of young people Thu Apr 02 21:31:21 BST 2015
It's obvious what Crosby's last minute advice to Cam was -  "whenever you can't defend our record, then: Attack Ed Mili personally" Thu Apr 02 21:22:15 BST 2015
Cameron silent on his NHS record. Thu Apr 02 20:58:37 BST 2015

#leadersdebate Cam talks about tax cuts. Never forget they put up VAT. They would do it again. Thu Apr 02 20:34:02 BST 2015
Doubling the amount of the cuts next year can only result in a direct threat to the NHS Thu Apr 02 20:25:25 BST 2015
Tories won't tackle billion pound tax avoidance by hedge funds. Their party are largely funded by hedge funds. Thu Apr 02 20:22:38 BST 2015
#leadersdebate Cleggy backed the millionaires tax cut and Cam won't deny that he will do it again if they win. Thu Apr 02 20:19:50 BST 2015

Mr Cameron you pretend that the econ is improving but working people are £1600 worse off per year Thu Apr 02 20:09:39 BST 2015

@Colin00007 @steveashtonukip when miners' families in coalfield communities see UKIP leader Farage with pic of Mrs T, they will be shocked. Sat Feb 14 17:01:19 GMT 2015
@Colin00007 @steveashtonukip my area, which is in Wakefield, had thousands of miners made redundant by Farage's idol http://t.co/2sNk02Fa69 Sat Feb 14 16:56:44 GMT 2015
@Colin00007 @steveashtonukip The point is that Nigel Farage's idol is Mrs Thatcher and she brutally closed the mines http://t.co/ddayhIp3br Sat Feb 14 16:48:46 GMT 2015
@Colin00007 @steveashtonukip come off it, Col.Ukip's leader proudly says he is a Thatcherite. Farage's heroine closed the mines. Sat Feb 14 16:37:03 GMT 2015

@CaptEBlackadder Dear Mr Ed 'tory whinger' Adder, cheer up. Life is looking up and when you lose in May you will be able to stop whingeing Thu Feb 12 20:41:08 GMT 2015
@AK9239 I asked local a & e consultant if there are loads of mid mgt to be cut-as you wish. She said it'd be a disaster & patients'd suffer Thu Feb 12 20:36:57 GMT 2015
My blood boils at food banks feeding the hungry whilst the Tory ex Treasurer agrees that he engaged in tax minimisation measures. Thu Feb 12 15:52:06 GMT 2015
“The NHS in it's current form cannot sustain itself. That's not an opinion, it's a fact and UKIP want to address that!" Yes, by privatising! Thu Feb 12 15:14:11 GMT 2015
@CaptEBlackadder dear Mr Adder you also say in addition to being a frustrated tory, that you are also an 'experienced whinger'! Exactly Thu Feb 12 15:12:52 GMT 2015
Talking to Pauline Kitching this afternoon about issues affecting Upton. http://t.co/Q94hDCFFtC Thu Feb 12 13:33:39 GMT 2015
@CaptEBlackadder your biog says that you are a 'frustrated Tory'. I can understand why. Thu Feb 12 13:17:19 GMT 2015
Well done Ed Miliband on tax avoiders. This is a central issue for our country. Labour will not back down. Dodgy Tories with dodgy donors. Thu Feb 12 12:58:32 GMT 2015
Anyone seeing Nigel Farage's speech today should visit http://t.co/ngFcqINdG3 - his desire to privatise the NHS, in his own words Thu Feb 12 12:39:15 GMT 2015
If you didn't know, planning application for a showman site on green belt in Fitzwilliam has been deferred. I remain opposed #thefightgoeson Thu Feb 12 12:22:15 GMT 2015
No single speech is going to hide Farage’s beliefs on NHS privatisation and tax breaks for those at the top: http://t.co/RHzZv2RcoA Thu Feb 12 12:06:39 GMT 2015

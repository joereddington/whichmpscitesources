@Harryinreview it's a spurious debate invented by chattering class who are right wing by inclination designed to demoralise & it won't work.
The main leadership questions today is why Cam can't stand up to his own back benches and can't win byelex in safe Tory seats.
ordinary people are discussing is the price of food, the cost of heating the house and how their wage doesn't last till the next pay packet.
BBC spends full 10 mins on Labour leadership. Meanwhile Cam about to lose 2nd by-election barely mentioned.

@MickMcAteer try to calm down. Have u looked at your own self description on Twitter? No idea what it means but assume your audience get it
@leonpaternoster @LukemCresswell Depends who you are talking to, comrade.
Labour has laid out a clear transformative agenda. In office we will build an economy which works for working people. Simple as
“@tnewtondunn: Clegg: "You start popular but inexperienced, as you get better at your job you get less popular".yes but he hasn't got better
“@BBCLookNorth: Find out why the PM wrote to Geof Boycott after naming Hague The Greatest Yorkshireman” he'll need to a write to a lot more

“@davrwu: My dad's GP said they r destroying NHS. Rather believe a GP than PM.” Aye, local GP told me we are gonna lose another 36 doctors
Tory tax policy - squeeze lower income earner by cutting working people's benefits and a huge cut in tax paid by upper income earners
Cameron says he wants to make it easier to see a GP. Why, then, has he spent the last four and a half years making it harder?

OMG! "@Kevin_Maguire: Ukip boasted 2 more Cons poised to defect. 2nd MP on eve or close of Cameron's speech? Guerrilla tactics terrify Cons”
With 2nd Tory MP joining UKIP, it's clear they are more tory than the tories. Talk about attacking labour heartlands is fatuous nonsense
Read @MichaelDugherMP exposing UKIP http://t.co/kTedKaOwFP

“@redstarbelsize: Ukip aim to do in South Yorkshire what the UDM did in Notts 30 years ago - Tory money behind both operations." Agree
It's clear that Farage idolises Mrs Thatcher. But we will never forget she destroyed much British industry - especially Yorks coalfields
Look at this & draw your own conclusion: UKIP see themselves as the true heirs to Mrs Thatcher.  http://t.co/x8gdd2jKSN

Govt lose vote
Huge number of MPs joining us voting against bedroom tax including some Tories!!!!
Govt lose first vote on bedroom tax. Second more important vote now
@DaveRowden1 yes I agree; we must say as we do and do as we say
@DaveRowden1 OK. Understood. But watch this space. Remember that we have moved on from New Labour
@DaveRowden1 I don't believe there is such a thing as a safe seat these days. But you haven't answered my question.
@DaveRowden1 but doesn't that mean that you could be helping this rotten govt to win again?
@Robbill123 @labourpress I am sorry my friend but you are wrong, just as you can't be bothered to spell my name correctly
@BruceHosie @djdaddums let's see what happens when the votes are counted in the Commons. Labour is wholly opposed to this horrific tax
@YouEngage evasive reply - please answer question. Can there be compromise with a govt which rewards richest and hammers poorest? yes or No?
@Robbill123 @labourpress come on coffee drinker you know you are wrong
@YouEngage do you really, honestly think there can be compromise with a party which rewards the richest and hammers down on the poor?
@Robbill123 @labourpress no it wasn't
@Cadrieu because the proposal today is by a LibDem seeking to make amendments to the bedroom tax
@YouEngage Yes, politics is sometimes about basic disagreements concerning the future direction of the country. Rightly so.
Important day today in Commons. We will vote to amend the Bedroom Tax but if elected next year we will abolish it entirely.

@EYTalking @ajjolley so you don't think textbooks should ever be used, even though all top performers use them? Where's your evidence?
@c0mplexnumber it's not the time, it's how it's being used. Japan, China etc build on high quality materials rather than recreating them.
@c0mplexnumber we have some of the highest hours of non-contact time in the OECD.

@judeenright we give the highest bursaries to maths recruits and schools have flexibility to pay more to those teachers.
Too many students drop maths at 16 and limit future options. There has not been a good option for non-specialists. Core Maths will fill gap.

Parents should be able to take 15 hours for 2,3 and 4s at times that suit. Funding childminders and school nurseries offering 8-6 will help.
In Peckham with Boris, on helping London school nurseries to open 8-6. School nurseries provide half London's places, mostly open only 9-3.
Record number of girls taking GCSE physics- let's encourage them to do A level. Current 20 pc girls with A* go on compared to 50 pc boys.
@Chris_Lamb agree vital. But if competitors are producing many more scientists, engineers and analysts than us - we will suffer economically
England has lower than av. gender gap in reading (where girls do better) and higher than av. gap in science and maths (where boys do better)

Not heard anything from @TristramHuntMP about new GCSEs. Does he support a larger maths GCSE with stronger numeracy demand and more stretch?

A Level entries increased hugely during 1990s before intro of Curric 2000 (AS and A2). Impact of AS and A2 was to reduce nos taking maths.
@MrChrisBeard a lot of students dropped it after one year finding it tough. 2 year A Level course gives more time to absorb subject in depth

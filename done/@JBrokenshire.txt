Good luck to my brother-in-law Andrew running to raise money for @DyslexiaRTrust & everyone taking part in today's @LondonMarathon Sun Apr 26 08:46:34 BST 2015
With 2m jobs created - more than the rest of the EU put together - let's stick with @Conservatives plan which is working. Sun Apr 26 07:24:37 BST 2015
Congratulations to the Bexley & Dartford branch of @ParkinsonsUK on celebrating their 30th anniversary http://t.co/v5K9mbvDwx Sat Apr 25 15:36:23 BST 2015
Congratulations to @BexleyCAMRA celebrating 40 years & for the 10th Bexley Beer Festival. Some great #Bexley beers! http://t.co/aujUh7u474 Sat Apr 25 10:39:18 BST 2015
Don't sleepwalk into the nightmare of a Labour Government. Let's get behind @Conservatives plan which is working. http://t.co/zfYLhRy67g Sat Apr 25 09:10:27 BST 2015
@brendon_rogers james@jamesbrokenshire.com Fri Apr 24 22:34:14 BST 2015
@brendon_rogers If you have any specific questions you can always email me. Fri Apr 24 22:17:29 BST 2015
Thanks to St John Fisher RC Church in #Bexley Village for a really thoughtful & wide ranging question & answer session this evening. Fri Apr 24 21:53:21 BST 2015
Thanks to Christ the King College #Sidcup for hosting a great discussion with students. Some excellent & informed topical questions @ctksfc Fri Apr 24 15:18:33 BST 2015
Supporting @macmillancancer call for better cancer care as new Queen Mary's #Sidcup Centre takes shape #TimeToChoose http://t.co/NebO4TBvbc Thu Apr 23 14:09:31 BST 2015
Pleased to support the fantastic @MaryMacleod2015. Positive feedback for @Conservatives in #Chiswick this evening. http://t.co/d0c8V31anN Wed Apr 22 23:38:06 BST 2015
@teamleyla Very sorry to hear about your situation. Please email me the details and I would be happy to pursue. Wed Apr 22 19:40:44 BST 2015
Another good campaign session tonight. Strong @Conservatives support & concern at risk of Labour propped up by SNP http://t.co/nOX9GIlRfM Tue Apr 21 19:45:51 BST 2015
With 2m jobs created, 2.2m apprenticeships started, growth up, consumer confidence up let's stick with @Conservatives plan which is working Sun Apr 19 12:00:41 BST 2015
A Labour Gov propped up by the SNP would lead to fewer controls on immigration & more open borders. A vote for UKIP makes this more likely. Sun Apr 19 07:27:39 BST 2015
@ChrisBearfoot Sorry that you weren't aware. The Sidcup event is the only formal hustings. If you have questions do email & I will follow up Sat Apr 18 13:05:05 BST 2015
With 1.9m jobs created & consumer confidence at a 12 year high now is not the time to put the economic plan at risk http://t.co/vUbxokLmea Fri Apr 17 08:46:33 BST 2015
Thanks to Churches Together in Sidcup for hosting tonight's excellent hustings event at St John's. Great turnout and interesting questions. Thu Apr 16 23:03:44 BST 2015

As part of @Conservatives plan we have cut income tax for over 26m people & delivered largest real-terms increase in min. wage since 2008 Tue Apr 14 17:50:20 BST 2015
Really positive announcement that under @Conservatives Gov't no-one earning the minimum wage will pay income tax http://t.co/Eu14uuoYKx Tue Apr 14 17:45:33 BST 2015
Absolutely right that @networkrail should apologise to #Southeastern passengers for severe delays at London Bridge http://t.co/NEfCu2OzVa Mon Apr 13 14:44:22 BST 2015

The data collected from exit checks will improve our ability to identify & tighten the immigration routes that are most vulnerable to abuse. Wed Apr 08 10:03:46 BST 2015
Exit checks will provide a clearer picture of who is leaving the UK & who is staying in the country when they have no right to be here. Wed Apr 08 10:03:34 BST 2015
Exit checks introduced at ports from today will provide vital information to confirm a person’s exit from the UK & help combat visa abuse. Wed Apr 08 10:03:22 BST 2015
Migrant health surcharge introduced today plus broader reforms to recover health costs expected to put an extra £0.5bn a year into the #NHS Mon Apr 06 10:23:28 BST 2015

@boadh398 can you email through the details? Tue Mar 17 15:18:48 GMT 2015

Many congratulations to the cast, musicians & backstage crew of @TownleyGrammar School's production of Annie. Great evening's entertainment. Fri Mar 13 00:17:14 GMT 2015
@bndcafc Question of balance of risk. The main thing is that we get things to work better over current three year period. Thu Mar 12 17:22:17 GMT 2015
@bndcafc Advocated TFL case at the time, but rather a question of risk of transfer at time of complex change at London Bridge. Thu Mar 12 17:16:51 GMT 2015
@bndcafc Short term, Southeastern need to improve punctuality & customer satisfaction & secure additional train units working with DfT. Thu Mar 12 17:05:43 GMT 2015
@bndcafc Post 2018 I would like to see Metro services in an extended Overground Network (which is a contracted service for TFL). Thu Mar 12 17:03:20 GMT 2015
@bndcafc Reality is that Southeastern hold the franchise for next 3 years & they need to do a lot better. Thu Mar 12 15:06:40 GMT 2015
Will be maintaining pressure on Southeastern Trains to improve performance at a meeting with MD David Statham this afternoon. Thu Mar 12 14:23:40 GMT 2015
@kentcabby Thank you for the additional information. I will certainly take up proper enforcement of the law with TFL. Wed Mar 11 12:09:11 GMT 2015
@kentcabby Don't sign EDMs as a result of collective responsibility obligations as a Gov Minister. Pursue matters directly as I've done here Tue Mar 10 22:43:21 GMT 2015
@kentcabby Sorry you choose to ignore the representations I've made to TFL to highlight cabbies concerns. Tue Mar 10 21:29:21 GMT 2015
@6287ad8ac894474 Email me and I will be more than happy to respond. Tue Mar 10 19:51:57 GMT 2015

Strange coincidence of having appeared on @daily_politics on their 10th birthday edition on the same day as my own birthday
Welcome news that the Administrator has recommended plans to secure Queen Mary's Hospital with King's now providing some specialist services
My initial comments on the Administrator's recommendations on South London hospitals - including Queen Mary's: http://t.co/sZJ3i1jo #QMYes
@marny52 Do hope that tonight's @releasethepeace concert is a huge success and helps take the message out to even more young people.
Recorded my own tip for the @GetSafeOnline campaign #clickandtell   | https://t.co/3C1YG3sE. Some other really good advice on the website
Really pleased that @GetSafeOnline week has started so well showing the simple steps we can all take to stay safe on the internet
Enjoyed attending Mass at St Lawrence's Church in Sidcup this evening to mark Father John Diver's induction as the new Parish Priest.
Thanks to everyone who supported today's #QMYes rally. We now await the Administrators report expected on 29 October to consider next steps.

Great evening of music from The Band of the Scots Guards at Christ Church, Bexleyheath in support of Royal British Legion & Help for Heroes
@oldblackfener Strangely enough, don't accept the analogy. Have fought constantly & consistently for best outcome for Queen Mary's #QMYes.
@JamesSilley Thanks for your kind comments. I very much enjoyed the discussion and the debate.

News that rail fare increases are to be curbed a very welcome announcement for commuters #cpc12
@Penrhyd Reality was that clinicians used the clinical safety card to push through the closures against huge local political opposition
Will be a guest on #bbcsp London tomorrow morning looking ahead to #cpc12 in Birmingham
@CurryUnion Sounds as if you know me too well!
@oldblackfener @jamescleverly Which is why I continue to press NHS Execs and SLHT's administrator to secure Queen Mary's future #QMYes

@SimonBeale congrats to your son. Enjoyed the evening celebrating the successes of so many great young people
@oldblackfener The QMH decision -which I opposed - was ultimately triggered by clinicians who claimed the services were 'unsafe'
@oldblackfener Agree on volunteers, but counter services relocated within Sidcup not closed and savings on estates help protect frontline
@oldblackfener I suppose I take the simple view that unless you try you can be certain the outcome won't be positive
@RamboSaysRelax Surgery appointments can be booked through my office as per the details on the website.

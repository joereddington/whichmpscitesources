Ed Miliband won't rule out a vote-by-vote deal with the SNP so he can be PM. It would mean more borrowing and more taxes and you would pay. Fri Apr 17 06:55:42 BST 2015

In Britain we've always shown we have the ingredients, the will – above all the people – to overturn what's inevitable… Tue Apr 14 12:06:50 BST 2015

The SNP are planning to hold Ed Miliband to ransom on Trident. A Conservative government would never put our national security at risk. Thu Apr 09 08:36:32 BST 2015
And our plan on education is working - with a million more children being taught in good or outstanding schools. http://t.co/JaDc5IDKeL Wed Apr 08 16:04:16 BST 2015
The @Conservatives are the union for parents - fighting to ensure more discipline, more rigour, and zero-tolerance of mediocrity in schools. Wed Apr 08 16:02:01 BST 2015
Today we've seen the chaos there'd be if Labour was ever allowed to be in charge of the economy. Don't let them take us back to square one. Wed Apr 08 13:23:33 BST 2015

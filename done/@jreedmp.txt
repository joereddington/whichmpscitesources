@jreedmp
@Jeremy_Hunt Delusional. Stop the work experience from using your account.
Excellent bilateral meeting with Norwegian delegation at the Foreign Office this morning. Now in the Commons for the #NHS bill.
@BBCPropaganda Nice of you to notice...
Column from yesterday's @WhitehavenNews 
http://t.co/jlKO75lkIF
You know you love it.
@robson_peter @ElectroEdd Did he really?
Arundhati Roy on #newsnight just now. Absolutely sensational.
@Jonathan_Todd @Amina_Lone I think he's about 5,000% certain to defect. Also, some kind of Sven joke.
@Jonathan_Todd He's not going to win prizes for maths, that's for sure.
@jimwaterson @MagsNews @JamieRoss7 You can't silence madness...
#ImACelebrity 
What are the odds on Mickey Buerk going bronco?
NAO - btwn 2010/11 and now, council tax as % of council revenue spending power gone from 70% to 18%.
NAO report into local government crisis truly startling. 80% of councils have added to reserves for fear of worsening crisis.
And the real, predictable shocker with huge consequences for the NHS - adult social care cuts equal 40% of 'savings'.
Staggering impact of Tory government on local councils in struggling areas. Incredible.
http://t.co/mTuT2RijkB
@dwilliamsHSJ @CharlieCooper8 I don't like cake either.
@Jeremy_Hunt Not point scoring to ask you to address issues that you consistently fail to acknowledge. You're presiding over a disaster.
@MoodySlayerUK I'm with you there, but at 99p I gave it a go. Je ne regrette rien.
#PMQs Pretty straightforward victory for Ed today, but I cannot stand PMQs anymore. A format designed to make people hate politics...
@camelsbestmate See you there.
@MoodySlayerUK Not sure Lidl do them. Aldi do. Also, Morrisons currently got good offers on Goodfellas.
@Paul_Burgin I always feel sorry for Chipping Norton. It doesn't deserve it, I realise.
#PMQs Cant wait to see Dave buying foie gras in Chipping Norton on #SmallBusinessSaturday 
Perfect for a country supper.
@Chris1966 Yep. And Colchester last week...
#PMQs @timfarron right about the impending catastrophe facing rural areas as a result of second home ownership.
#PMQs Under Cameron, hospitals are telling patients not to come to their hospital...
@BuzzFeedUKPol Cameron won't answer a single question. Not a single one. And his jokes are risible.
#PMQs Cameron should sack his joke writers. He has the worst 'gags' in living memory.
@Jeremy_Hunt Thanks for the tweet. How about answering some of my letters regarding the carnage you're causing in Cumbria?
@badhedgehog As a patron of that art, I should object, but I can sense the public interest.
Next week: Jeggings - is primary legislation needed to halt this menace? And, novelty ties - are they capable of ruining Christmas?
Of all the pointless fashions that keep returning like an unwanted boomerang, ripped jeans are surely the worst. Please stop it.
@Will_i_umny @TheRealMcGowan @HumzaYousaf It's about Britain, too.
@jordanwalker89 Yes. Yes I am.
@davidfrum @DCrittenden1 Turkey fryer?
@BigTamConnery Dinnae go tae yon scratchser yet Tam. I've bin roond Cubby Brocolli'sh hooshe...
@henrywinter @jordanwalker89 Still an awful, dreadful, painful dirge...
@TheRealMcGowan @HumzaYousaf The  deliberate conflation of England with 'Tory'. Terrible move. So damaging.
@TheRealMcGowan @HumzaYousaf And at this point, everyone forgets the referendum campaign ? Yes?
@CollectorManiac  "Caller on line one. What's your name ?"
"Robert Plant..."
@HumzaYousaf You're 100% right about xenophobia, though. A malignant theme. Encouraging resentment of any nation can never be progressive.
@HumzaYousaf Can't see anyone doing that . And I never will.
@HumzaYousaf Nope. But you prove the point . Complex issue. Think you can solve it in 140 characters?
@HumzaYousaf @mehdirhasan Haven't seen it, ever. Easy, dog whistle policies when difficult problems need sophisticated responses.
@HumzaYousaf @mehdirhasan No, each is a mirror image. Easy answers to complex problems.
@suttonnick Usually spot on, but that's a tortured, pointless headline.
@Elpapey Ha ha ! Nice work.
@jackwdoyle My copyright...
Awkward.
@AndiNicegrin @CumbriaCC A shocker. Any joy yet?
@Elpapey Where's the evidence?
@jessicaelgot Ooooooosh! Nice work.
Anyone done: "Runrig, Big Country, Deacon Blue, The Krankies; your boys took one hell of a beating.." yet?

AGENTS: Help your millionaire clients to stay in work by stopping them moaning about small taxes on their wealth as ordinary people suffer.
@RorySmithTimes Course they do.
Fairness to Scotland, crowd largely staying. Not like Dosenna's fourth for #lfc at Old Trafford. That's how to empty a ground.
#SCOvENG
@curlycaff England's is a painful dirge.

@copelandbc Excellent, thank you. What does that equate to in monetary terms?

@ashmcgregor Of course. I'm an idiot...

Where's Gove off to in the January transfer window? I'm not saying he's not very good, but Moyes is lining up a Â£30m bid. Viva Sociedad.
@HackneyAbbott Referring to yourself in the third person is a sign of meglomania according to Jamie Reed.
@LatoyaFerns @looknorthBBC Here, it's measured as the best, most cost effective system in the world.
@ackneylad Thought he didn't like being described as one? Didn't he kick off recently?
@HackneyAbbott No need to make names up. Surely plenty of real ones to choose from.
@hammersmithandy I will have done this in the past. And Frank Bruno.

@Amina_Lone @MissleeCarlisle @Andybettridge1 very happy to help.
@MissleeCarlisle @Amina_Lone @Andybettridge1 Great campaigning  in Carlisle yesterday.
@BenMcCombe @SuzanneWaldman 100% correct
@SuzanneWaldman No. It's a study in poor political decision making, but it's fundamentally UK's bill for the Cold War.
@kerenrudd @birdsey16 Yer wo?
@stellacreasy Shut up. No way.
@Toryhealth ...even in those hospitals he was asked to investigate. Now I suggest you get out of the boozer.
@Toryhealth Of course Prof Sir Bruce Keogh will have told you mortality rates we're reduced by btwn 30-50% in the decade prior to 2010...
@Toryhealth @LabourHealth Precisely why NOBODY trusts you with the NHS.
@Toryhealth @LabourHealth Is that really your response? Early drinking?
@MissleeCarlisle @NWAmbulance Hope all ok.

@alstewitn @FeministPics I'd prefer a counter-revolutionary biscuit such as a Bourbon or a chocolate-covered-oat-baked-Thatcher.
@RevRichardColes I knew him, Horatio..

Just finished this week's @WhitehavenNews column. It's a cracker. Live at 5pm on http://t.co/SUOadqNjju
@RevRichardColes If you're heading North, pop in.
Ethics, standards and values in football are about more than what happens on the pitch. Undeniably.
...to leave Sunderland over Di Canio and Charlie Webster is right to leave Sheffield Utd over Evans.
More on that some other time (Norwegian FA was very supportive...) but the point is David Miliband was right...
Which reminds me of a campaign I launched in the European Parliament almost 20yrs ago, to stop the use of landmines...
FIFA and UEFA hate football and 'politics' mixing. I know, don't laugh all at once, but national leagues also take that view.
@BBCEmilyUnia Ask about the staff amnesty I've asked for. Let the professionals speak out so we can address the problems & build on best.
@paullewismoney @PeterKenyon Yaaayyyy! Name them...
In an unforeseen twist, Real Sociedad have offered the Labour Party Â£20m for me as a left back. Discussing terms.

Brilliant turnout in Whitehaven - as usual - for Remembrance Sunday. Very, very proud. Very, very wet.
@stridingedge Yes, Eric, and thanks. Let me think how - but any ideas gratefully received.
So I'm uneasy about the ToL extension. I don't pretend I'm in the right, just not convinced.

 "How much is that my good man?"
It's still Â£3.50, Sir.

@GeorgeSermon You're welcome any time, George - you pay for it after all. The PM says "hello".
@Xtreme_fitness1 @emelisande Absolutely fantastic.
@AnnePickles @JohnStevensonMP @RoryStewartUK @newsandstar Brilliant appeal. Thanks for doing it.
@helenpidd @HazzyC and that's nut all. You're welcome.
@ruralred @RoryStewartUK @timfarron Please DM me the details and I'll take it up straight away.

@NorthCumbriaNHS 
Can you explain these poorly judged comments? And answer my questions?

@AnnePickles Threaten to leave Sky and they beg for you back on a reduced fee. Threaten to leave EU and they will call your bluff.

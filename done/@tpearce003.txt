@ScottTweed I agree. Selling off social housing is just wrong and also costs more in long run. Mon Apr 06 21:32:35 BST 2015
@ScottTweed it's meant to be 80% of market rent. So it's still far to high for many people. Mon Apr 06 21:29:43 BST 2015
@ScottTweed in my opinion we need more social housing. Mon Apr 06 21:27:21 BST 2015

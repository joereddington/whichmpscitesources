How much are you betting on a labour win @MSmithsonPB ? Fri Apr 03 20:20:50 BST 2015
After 2 hours of debate, which one could you see facing down Mr Putin or negotiating with President Obama? Only Cameron is up to the job. Thu Apr 02 21:54:34 BST 2015
At last! The 1st thing Ed has said that I agree with- "yes we did get it wrong & I admit it" You can't trust Labour to protect our country Thu Apr 02 21:27:13 BST 2015
Miliband now telling us he doesnt trust you to have a say over Europe. Ed wont,Nigel can't.Only the Conservatives can give you a referendum Thu Apr 02 21:24:18 BST 2015
David Cameron asks "what about Mid Staffs?" Ed Miliband has no answer. NONE! That's why we can't trust Labour with the NHS #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:58:50 BST 2015
Is Mr Farage having a Richard Nixon moment? #leadersdebate #sweatynigel Thu Apr 02 20:43:29 BST 2015
The only one looking like a Leader in #leadersdebates is Cameron. No one else looks capable of being our PM Thu Apr 02 20:37:58 BST 2015
Thanks for you vote @hallgav @Conservatives Thu Apr 02 20:36:25 BST 2015
Am I the only one who thinks that #leadersdebate looks like the Weakest Link set with Julie Etchingham wearing Anne Robinson's glasses Thu Apr 02 20:35:35 BST 2015
David Cameron is the only one in #leadersdabate who isn't going to increase the taxes you & your family pay. Thu Apr 02 20:32:49 BST 2015
What Ed Miliband isn't saying in #leadersdabate is that he's going to tax every working family £3000. Why  risk your family's security? Thu Apr 02 20:30:18 BST 2015
As Cameron says, Labour opposed every saving and difficult decision this govt took. Miliband's only answer is to borrow more & tax you more. Thu Apr 02 20:21:04 BST 2015

@Andybettridge1 not even you sound like you believe that. We are all just waiting for the next embarrassment Labour bring to East Staffs. Wed Mar 18 00:06:43 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 it's true isn't it? You're ashamed of Julian Mott and his cuts on the YMCA. Tue Mar 17 22:18:34 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 supporting Labour cuts on the homeless to try to buy an election. Shame! Tue Mar 17 22:12:28 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 why not get Julian Mott to make a statement about why he axed funding for the YMCA & Burton Albion Community Trust? #silence Tue Mar 17 22:03:44 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 I dont need to say anymore.You arent even trying to defend the choices of Julian Mott. Youre embarrassed. And you should be! Tue Mar 17 21:55:40 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 the YMCA axe was a choice. Labour has money in the bank. You should be embarrassed . Tue Mar 17 21:43:08 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 Julian Mott insults a deceased man, Labour axe funds for the YMCA. What's next Andrew? What's the next Labour Scandal? 😳 Tue Mar 17 21:40:41 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 you flunked the test. Party before people. Tue Mar 17 21:38:01 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 you can't win every battle. But I fight for what what I believe in. Shame you don't have the courage to do the same Tue Mar 17 21:32:38 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 so tell Julian Mott to reverse Labour's cut on the YMCA. Be brave! Tue Mar 17 21:31:02 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 do you think Burton Labour should cut YMCA funding while putting £200k in reserves? Yes or no? Tue Mar 17 21:30:01 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 as the Patron of the YMCA I spoke out publicly to anyone that would listen. Why can't you say that Labours cut is wrong? Tue Mar 17 21:25:54 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 oh dear! I expected better. Defending cuts on the poor. Is that what Labour is about now? Tue Mar 17 21:19:51 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 what a shame you aren't brave enough to say when your Labour council get it wrong.Condoning cuts to the homeless. Sad really Tue Mar 17 21:10:00 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 do you agree with Ron Clark? Is the YMCA worth funding? If not, why not? Tue Mar 17 21:05:57 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 if your council can afford to cut council tax & bank £200k, why are they cutting ymca funding? Your choices hurting homeless Tue Mar 17 21:05:12 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1  I agree with Cllr Ron Clarke. Why doesn't Julian Mott & your Labour group? Labour are hypocrites! http://t.co/6Onsf1cG62 Tue Mar 17 20:50:32 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 Labour are spending roughly the same amount on charities. So why axe the Burton YMCA & Burton Albion Community Trust? Tue Mar 17 20:45:48 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 you might find it uncomfortable but your Labour Council has CHOSEN to cut the YMCA funding & the Burton Albion CT money Tue Mar 17 20:27:57 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 if Labour can afford to cut council tax AND put £200k in the bank, why are they cutting money to the YMCA? Tue Mar 17 20:19:35 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 unlike you, Im prepared to speak out if I think something is wrong, including criticising my cllrs if I think they are wrong Tue Mar 17 19:00:25 GMT 2015
@Andybettridge1 yes it was. The YMCA will confirm that & my efforts on their behalf. Aren't you upset by the crank hypocrisy of Labour? Tue Mar 17 18:58:34 GMT 2015
@TheErasmo @GlynDaviesMont Nat Min Wage Earners will earn £11971.40 after tax

@AlexElliott5 @eaststaffsbc Yes- homeless people will lose out thanks to the decision of the Council.Burtonians strongly support our YMCA Tue Mar 17 13:30:13 GMT 2015
@AlexElliott5 @eaststaffsbc I am biased.  I think the YMCA do amazing work. But then so did the Labour Mayor just a couple of months ago. Tue Mar 17 13:21:47 GMT 2015
@AlexElliott5 @eaststaffsbc Agreed, but as patron of the YMCA, I know they have. Brilliant work in our community. Tue Mar 17 13:08:47 GMT 2015
@CJSBSB I agree.  The Maltings is an eyesore.  Need to attract more shoppers back onto High Street Tue Mar 17 12:38:00 GMT 2015
So there you have it. @eaststaffsbc thought Burton YMCA request for homeless funding wasn't "quality". Please retweet http://t.co/THVvKRLYVs Tue Mar 17 12:31:20 GMT 2015
@Villadon7 @eaststaffsbc As they are cutting Council tax & putting £200k in the bank in reserves, how can it be? This needs to be reversed Tue Mar 17 12:18:32 GMT 2015
@CJSBSB Unemployment at record lows-under 80 in Uttoxeter, a new Waitrose, a new JCB factory. That doesn't sound life a coffin case to me Tue Mar 17 12:16:50 GMT 2015
Friends,as they are tweeting, you might want to ask @eaststaffsbc why they cut funding for Burton YMCA & Burton Albion Community Trust? Tue Mar 17 11:05:13 GMT 2015
Great news that the national minimum wage will increase by 20p an hour to £6.70 from October, benefitting more than 1.4 million workers. Tue Mar 17 10:53:40 GMT 2015
.@eaststaffsbc It can't be budget cuts, because you are spending the same amount on charities. So why axe YMCA & Burton Albion CT? Tue Mar 17 10:22:53 GMT 2015
Thanks for the tweet @eaststaffsbc Can you explain why Burton YMCA funding was cut by 82% & Burton Albion Comunity Trust axed altogether? Tue Mar 17 10:21:52 GMT 2015
@LisaHarlowHello not there! Have fun for me! Mon Mar 16 20:34:57 GMT 2015
Or is it that Labour on East Staffs Council are trying to avoid answering difficult questions about something else? The truth will out! Mon Mar 16 09:58:28 GMT 2015
Or could it be Labour on East Staffs Council don't want to talk about the investigation into their Leader Julian Mott insulting a dead man? Mon Mar 16 09:57:12 GMT 2015
Could be Labour on East Staffs Council dont want to talk about cutting funding to Burton YMCA by 82% or Burton Albion Community Trust 100% Mon Mar 16 09:55:23 GMT 2015
So why have East Staffs Council bought forward by 2 weeks the self enforced silence before elections? What don't they want to talk about? Mon Mar 16 09:52:08 GMT 2015
Labour's E.Staffs Council have axed funding for Burton YMCA & Burton Albion Community Trust. https://t.co/Y1RLnjEh7F http://t.co/apn7VqBRFe Sat Mar 14 08:40:43 GMT 2015

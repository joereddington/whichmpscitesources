A vote for ukip means Ed Miliband in No10 & stops a referendum @reesmf @georgeuttheath
Thankfully all those UK citizens will have a vote In an in-out referendum so they will be able to decide for themselves @JoelTaylorMetro
As opposed to unlimited and uncontrolled immigration? @JoelTaylorMetro
I think that having controlled immigration makes perfect sense @JoelTaylorMetro
@JoelTaylorMetro address free movement to control immigration, more powers flowing to the UK, less red tape,less interference from EU instit
@JoelTaylorMetro That sounds like a politics essay question, not something to be answered in 140 characters!
But ultimately @JoelTaylorMetro I believe the British people should decide!

Amazing to see Labour in Burton talking down the success in cutting unemployment. It is down almost 60% in Burton since Labour left office.
Did you know thanks to the Conservatives, pensioners on the basic state pension are now £950 a year better off then they were under  Labour?
If you are one of the just 20 young people long term unemployed in Burton & Uttoxeter, contact me, & let's get you started on your career

Hi @TCLN_Ryster happy to help. Can you email me the details?
Im afraid @UKIPClacton @DouglasCarswell  I believe in a referendum on the EU, record growth & 1.8m jobs so I'm sticking with @conservatives
Sadly @DouglasCarswell this is more yours & Mr Reckless' ego than about you delivering a referendum on Europe.
Lots of eurosceptics in my party @DouglasCarswell - the only one that can deliver an EU referendum so the people can decide.
Indeed! @richardkhughes @BBCPropaganda @DanHannanMEP @EricPickles http://t.co/GpaOGa61RX
Told Mr Reckless he should join ukip 4 years ago! Pleased not to have him speaking for my party anymore.  Relishing that election fight!

Miliband ditches references to deficit & immigration  http://t.co/9y4RfAH0RA Crisis? What crisis?
Al Green's "Let's Say together - 51 times" #Miliconferencesongs
"You say it best, when you say nothing at all about the deficit" #miliconferencesongs
I was wrong to say Ed M said nothing on the deficit in his speech.He also said nothing on the economy, on immigration or English devolution
Listened to Ed Miliband's speech. Not one mention of how he would pay off the debt, only how he would tax you & spend more of your money
At a meeting yesterday pleased to learn @nationalbrewery recruited 10 staff members @BurtonJobsFair last week.
Fingers crossed for you @Leukaemia_and_K - you really deserve it. It would also be recognition for the support from @BurtonMailNews

Jobs Boom for Burton on Trent! http://t.co/9TD8tD7v31
To add to the growing list of jobs, the economy, world affairs... @Ed_Miliband has today also become irrelevant on constitutional reform.
@emmersonslaw I think what your describing is effectively only English MPs voting on issues which effect England exclusively.
@englishoak then make your case to the voters, but I don't think my electors want to pay millions for more politicians.
I support English votes for English MPs.  An English Parliament would mean taxpayers footing bill for more politicians- who would want that?
Very pleased we are are all still one country. Now let's have fairness for England- English votes for English MPs please Prime Minister!

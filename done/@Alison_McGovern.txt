A debate about power that just makes Westminster people debate own internal workings is missing both the point and the chance to change.

1. Crack open Westminster, end elitism  2. Devolve power to cities  3. Better working life for everyone. #ToDoList
@amrachel important question - we need most coherent local economies to work together & have right powers. 'City' shorthand for those units

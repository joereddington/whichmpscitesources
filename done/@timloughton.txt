@timloughton
@TheArkLambeth @babybuddyapp thanks and well done for a great speech
@IDickson258 enough - the cost of subsequent failure is much more expensive
@bachulus @BBCr4today @BBCNews too long if it is true
Disappointing & unacceptable that too many  authorities still not up 2 speed with Child Sexual Exploitation Action Plan I launched 3 yrs ago
@Helen121 not blocked but harder to get victims to give evidence that makes charges stick now being addressed in more user friendly courts
@SandiDunnUK @BBCr4today that's exactly what I did and had 4 groups of vulnerable children regularly advising me at DfE
Thanks for the hectic engagement, but remember this needs to happen all year round & to all MPs #UKyouthpolitics @Parliament_Week
Don't know but this is something the new Civil Society Minister can take up @hudpolitics @Parliament_Week #UKyouthpolitics
So buzz down to the hustings & challenge your wannabe MPs & then make your vote count at the polling station @Your_VoteUK #UKyouthpolitics
As Anita Roddick said "If you think you are too small to make a difference, try going to bed with a mosquito" @Your_VoteUK #UKyouthpolitics
Localism act gives greater powers to local communities to run facilities & YP have as much right to be part of this as adults @2020Comms
Like it or not most decisions affecting yr everyday life are political&ignoring politicians is not the way to get what you want @ShaunGunner
As long as it doesn't become just another boring subject, need to show YP how politics gives ability to shape local ctties @VotingCountsUK
& parliament has never been more welcoming for school groups, & engaging YP in debates w/ their MPs on imp. issues @uponacloud @LeonjWard
Shame mainstream media doesn't cover @UKYP more @2020Comms & perhaps need youth reporter slots on every TV new channels #ukyouthpolitics
Ironically YP engt w/ politics through other campaign groups has never been higher. Political parties need to learn from this @LeonjWard
Too many YP stories in media are negative & that is part of the prob championing NCS & @UKYPs excellent work is part of solution @VFAnderson
More on positve4youth here: #ukyouthpolitics @Parliament_Week https://t.co/zJgGi3RmXf
2/3 being youth-proofed, positive4youth had young people being consulted at it's heart & before anything was published #ukyouthpolitics
.@Parliament_Week In parliament the youth select ctte has a serious direct line into gov & many gov policies are increasingly 1/3
They're not & any politician who does @divair, does so at his or her peril & ignores the future #ukyouthpolitics @Youth_Debate
Disagree @VFAnderson some of the gobbiest MPs come from state schools like me, all you need is attitude & self-belief @Your_VoteUK
Get involved w/local youth cabinet&summon your MP&councillors to account for what they're doing locally,then tweet about it @tom_says_hello
People & politicians need to remember that politics is all about the people by the people @Your_VoteUK @VFAnderson #ukyouthpolitics
Disagree @LeonjWard I am in schools every week engaging w/YP as I did when minister & this influences me more than anything on YP issues
Don't agree @LeonjWard, through social media YP have never a more powerful tool to express thier views to a huge audience #ukyouthpolitics
As a vet MYP @MrJW18,you know it is down to YP themselves, but schools, MPs & councillors all need to help light that spark #ukyouthpolitics
.@VFAnderson reps to hear their voices. YP are 20% of the pop but 100% of the future & any pol would be crazy to ignore #ukyouthpolitics 2/2
Making it another compulsory subject risks killing it stone dead @VFAnderson, instead YP shd want to challenge elected #ukyouthpolitics
 1/2
Thru positive4youth we want strong local youth voice in every authority through youth mayors, @UKYP,youth cab or what works best @AmiraHou
Care leavers are getting a better deal at last @IDickson258 & children in care councils nationwide are now getting their voices heard
.@VFAnderson NCS is a really good way of recruiting YP from all backgrounds to get engd with politics & community campaigns #ukyouthpolitics
Good point & I went to a very political comprehensive @VFAnderson & home sec, foreign sec, & @WilliamJHague all products of state school
& fantastic facilities through My Place offering new hubs for YP, business & community engagement but needs YP to be vocal @hamzaeric
Agree youth services have been soft target for local authorities @HamzaEric but govt doing much to encourage new partnerships... 1/2
Bang on the door of the town hall @uponacloud & make sure YP have seat at the top table through @UKYP youth mayors youth cabinet etc
#ukyouthpolitics @MrJW18 politics is what people make of it & they need to own politics again & everyone needs to engage like it or not
Hopefully the ref has inspired YP to engage w/ many more political campaigns affecting everyday lives not just independence @SmartYoungFolk
And I also have the youngest chairman of a parish council in the country YP need to put themselves forward more @HamzaEric #ukyouthpolitics
.@HamzaEric Worthing has 1 of the highest number of pensioners in the UK but this year we elected 3 councillors under 23 #ukyouthpolitics
.@thestudentroom This will need legislation in parliament & likely that some parties will promise in next election #UKyouthpolitics
.@Youth_Debate I don't support #votesat16 now but believe greater priority is to get more 18-24yos voting - only 43% do now #ukyouthpolitics
Taking questions on twitter about youth engagement as part of this year's #parliamentweek #ukyouthpolitics http://t.co/VcxuJlxHSC
Looking forward to my interactive Twitter chat on youth engagement this morning from 10-11  #DoDemocracy
@Dutchy100 itrelevant and not helpful if you really want this overarching inquiry to get on with getting to the truth
@ciabaudo @David_Cameron absolutely not evidence of that nor logic in it and in any case it is Home Sec leading on this
@waterside09 @discovery77_ @RebeccaHerber44 @ExaroNews absolutely not
@DrAndrewWatt and as a member of Home Affairs Select Comm I am the last one to let anything get swept under the carpet or not scrutinised
@RebeccaHerber44 @ExaroNews fine words may not butter the parsnips but in  right place they helped 2 get  inquiry we urgently need 2 start
@waterside09 @RebeccaHerber44 @ExaroNews it is about justice 4 past survivors, support 4 longterm sufferers & prevention 4 future victims
@RebeccaHerber44 @ExaroNews if that were the case there would be no inquiry or promise by Home Sec to make all Govt depts comply & disclose
@openjotter & criminal investigations are what we are getting alongside the overarching inquiry to try to make some sense of it all at last
@Ackroydbrown @ExaroNews and that is why we need to achieve justice and some form of closure that may come with it & not put inquiry on hold
@RebeccaHerber44  @ExaroNews I think that is unfair. It was certainly a sloppy & insensitive reaction but no lack of determination 2 act
@discovery77_ just as a few politicians tarred us all over expenses these criminals harm us all & we must root them out & bring  2 justice
@Ackroydbrown @ExaroNews that is unfortunately right and his choice od words were unhelpful to say the least but we must move ahead
2/2 to get to the truth and we need to do everything we can to give them that belief otherwise everyone loses out.
1/2 Abuse survivors need to believe that all of us in politics r trying to get the abuse enquiry to go everywhere & anywhere it needs to go
2/2 as well as all other institutions and cases it needs urgently to get to work on. Any suspicion of cover up can only harm all in politics
1/2 Latest revelations from @ExaroNews truly shocking making it even more important that abuse enquiry leaves no stone unturned in political
Excellent article @montie on why if you are aspirational, democratic and really want EU referendum you must vote Tory http://t.co/RcEf87RKFw
@mattforde Matt I'm woŕried I think you need to get out more
There is still time to bid in the Charlie's Fund silent auction with some great lots http://t.co/HW7nxqbbyr

Sorry 2 be missing for the 1st time @UKYP sitting in Commons tomorrow-always a fantastic event showcasing what's best about our young people
Delighted that Anne Longfield is to be next Children's Commissioner for England and this time endorsed by Education Select @CommonsEd
@deletedbyMPs I have never deleted any tweets. What is this about?
@bantam_polly The advances in last few years are remarkable & was never going to be completely straightforward but this is a temporary blip
2/2 all plain sailing so shouldn't panic now about reversible temporary fall in numbers-many more adopters will bring many more loving homes
1/2 The dramatic change in mindset to advantages of adoption since 2010 has brought huge benefits to 1000's more kids -was never going to be
@martinnarey It's Worthing and to lose one lost cause is unfortunate but 2 !!
@martinnarey did you mean Mlliband electrocuting rather than electrifying effect on audience Martin? You've defended some lost causes b4 but
@NealLees He had some fascinating stories - glad to have him there
2/2 & toasted with 54.5% British Navy Pusser's Rum (it all went). Thanks 2 Mayor Vic and Harry Goring Vice Lord Lieut http://t.co/8rTK0pLElG
1/2 Real privilege to organise the second medal presentation ceremony to local Arctic Star veterans and their families at Worthing Town Hall
2/2 & ending poignantly with the lighting of the T lights on the ramparts of Shoreham Fort thanks to Gary & his team http://t.co/fYvVtVi4cV
1/2 All today's Remembrance services across the constituency today were packed starting with Southwick Green http://t.co/c7yoOUwnNr

@pauloginsky @Rosie_Ferg @YouthImpactUK @KConnol_LYOUTH much more like you!
@Rosie_Ferg @pauloginsky @YouthImpactUK @KConnol_LYOUTH cheer up!!
@JackGYSC Pleasure - well done for a high quality report
@BGMScotland It is Lewes where Norman Baker is the current MP
@BGMScotland @AlexSalmond nothing to do with me-not even my constituency though I did go to school there
@LouiseMensch @politicalhackuk but it is the Pope from the 1550's when they burnt the Lewes protestant martyrs not the current one
@tonylelliott Used to be combined Post Office but the post office branch network has always been made up of privately run sub-post offices
@tonylelliott except that Post Office separate from Royal Mail & remains state owned except for 90% of branches which always were private
@JacquiMatten @educationgovuk Sure there will be more opportunities in the future - we need many more people willing to offer loving homes
@LoveBroadwater @PostOffice @EWAS3 Oh dear - not a good start
Pleased 2 report MSK contract delayed 2 April as CCG and Worthing Hospital agree 2 joint independent impact assessment on local NHS services
@ciabaudo Except she didn't did she?
@HackneyChild @rubeusflint You may think so - I couldn't possibly comment!
@Auwyn_ Nothing to share - it's in the public domain. #justsaying
@emmersonslaw Good point but with nowhere as wide a remit though
Norman Baker was of course the minister with the cross-governmental lead on child sexual exploitation. Now how many other people knew that?
@MAMAAUK Good point
@rights_victims but it follows Hilsboro model which worked well without statutory basis & there is promise of beefing it up if its a problem
@DavidAshley17 Exactly - it is not a one woman show and has a very strong panel of experts operating under v strong public scrutiny
Home Sec agreed with my point that child abuse survivors should be part of chair appointment process & able 2 feed into it every step of way
The Home Sec statement on child abuse inquiry very well measured and puts victims & survivors at its heart with direct engagement from her
@DeeRiginal It was a pleasure. A great event
@conoron19 @WarwickHunt4 @ciabaudo @jayceebrownbook @ZacGoldsmith Home Sec is the one minister who made inquiry happen & deserves support
@conoron19 @WarwickHunt4 @ciabaudo @jayceebrownbook @ZacGoldsmith the Home Secretary is the one Minister who made this inquiry happen
@themutewitness  I didnt brush over anything but this is not a trial or inquiry about 1 person & risks losing sight of bigger picture
@themutewitness  only about your apparent ill-informed prejudice it would seem
@themutewitness @BBCNewsnight for what exactly?
@Privateallergy @MAMAAUK @IanMcFadyen1966 @wheatear9 actually Tim didn't mention it at all but don't let that ruin a dud argument
still waiting @themutewitnes
@IanMcFadyen1966 @MAMAAUK @wheatear9 thank u & I agree which is why when undertaking CSE Action Plan in 2011 I met many survivors & families
@jramscar @JimGamble_INEQE exactly
@colinsmartone @JimGamble_INEQE as I am now a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee I will be able to take this forward too
@ShyKeenan @Auwyn_ and I know there is a lot more being set up. Have you advised Home Sec directly Shy?
@colinsmartone @JimGamble_INEQE exactly
@JimGamble_INEQE  not handled well but I don't believe there was any intention to mislead behind them. Can u recall all times we have met?
@Auwyn_ @ShyKeenan yes & clearly more needed to be done but putting survivors on panel & emphasising listening 2 their groups was good start
@colinsmartone @JimGamble_INEQE fear u r right but some people just fuelling this understandable frenzy of mistrust & we have to crack that
@ShyKeenan Getting Govt 2 agree 2 overarching inq with such wide remit after all these years amounts 2 lot more than thoughtless crumbs....
@colinsmartone @JimGamble_INEQE & thats why we have said inquiry must go anywhere & everywhere it needs to go until all victims voices heard
@JimGamble_INEQE & not just the HO role but ironically Fiona Woolf trying 2 be as transparent as possible & Home Sec genuinely committed too
@wheatear9 @BBCNewsnight On the run from what? I have been urging this inquiry for over 2 yrs & desperately don't want it to fail now
@ali_cain @BBCNewsnight  Absolutely and that must fit into part of this overarching inquiry and we risk losing sight of bigger picture
@JimGamble_INEQE  Jim you know above anyone that this is not a trial & not about LB or any 1 person and we're losing sight of bigger picture
@themutewitnes For what exactly?
Will be on Newsnight and World Tonight later talking about latest developments in the Child Sexual Abuse Inquiry
@mwilliamsthomas The #CSAInquiry always has wanted to consult victims and will do intensively as well as have them represented on the panel

@mattystarling21 With those anger management issues and that ignorant attitude I will put it down as a lucky escape. You will suit UKIP well
@Spetmologer same criteria applies 2 all EU countries so all equally a stab in the dark-apparently includes things like prostitution & drugs
@Spetmologer Actually it's retrospective mostly for years when Labour was in Govt going back to 1990's
@mattystarling21 Think you need to read it again-it says VOTE not vote for me. Sorry a birthday card offends you. Happy birthday anyway.
Why on earth should we trust a £1.7bn retrospective surcharge when EU's accounts not been in order for the last 19 years? DC right to say NO
The biggest cheek of EU's retrospective surcharge is that it covers the 19 years during which the EU's own accounts have not been signed off

Great 2 catch up with some old friends & inspiring people @barnardos last night with new boss Javid Khan leading the way against child abuse
Packed room in Commons 4 40th anniv Federation Small Businesses with Peter Bottomley & Worthings Trevor Constable http://t.co/jMeGuufGXR
@JemimaBlandLD @KayLibDem Think she is on Sompting Parish actually AKA Dibley Parish Council #absenteeLibDems
@davechapman49 well said David
@Littlemsmum of course that is right but there is no evidence that it will be anything but or that the Govt would want it otherwise
@IanChisnall  clearly this lot doesn't either-why should they have a monopoly on care for the NHS when they clearly have a political agenda
@WorthingLibDems Is she still your candidate cos no one seems 2 have heard of her let alone seen her in E Worthing & Adur? #absenteeLibDems
@IanChisnall Why-what have they done locally? Certainly not anything to save health services for my constituents.
@LoveShoreham Never heard of KeepNHSpublic but they were nowhere to be seen when we set up KWASH & won fight for our local hospitals
@JamesMButcher Never heard of Keep NHS Public but they were certainly nowhere to be seen when we set up KWASH & won fight for our hospitals
Lib Dem proposal free bus passes for16yr olds 1st put forward by me at DfE in 2012 & set up working gp with UKYP & bus companies #justsaying
@IanMcFadyen1966 suggesting she could not chair an inquiry dispassionately on basis she knows 1 individual absolutely attacks her integrity
@JeanHaines what I am appalled about is delay in getting the inquiry underway while people who know nothing about Woolf r quick to condemn
@IanMcFadyen1966 just not true. How do you think I got the CSE action plan through in 2011?
@johnpaulprice71 my decency as an MP meant I have been campaigning 4 this 4 yrs having met many victims-derailing inq will let everyone down
@maeveofmarsden at some stage ppl have just got 2 trust that the ppl on child abuse panel just want 2 get on with uncovering truth 4 victims
@IanMcFadyen1966 I've been debating this 4 years but more importantly set up CSA action plan when minister so u are attacking  wrong person
@IanMcFadyen1966 certainly not which is why this Govt is 1st 2 do something about it-seeing conspiracies in every suggestion gets us nowhere
No surprise 38 Deg trying 2 get in on act 2 derail child abuse inquiry objecting 2 new chair-veto next candidate cos applied 2 Jim'll Fixit?
@mikecoulson48 Fiona Woolfe was announced yesterday and has my support
Street surgery in Southwick Square with Conservative cllrs & we will have a survey on recent traveller encampment & plans 4 new play area
@lancingutdltd @LancingUnitedFC @JSPCComputers @aacbrian @somptinglocal @ @JamesMButcher  good luck
@realperidot54 utmost integrity & highly respected and now we need to get on with it. It's not a one woman show-whole panel working with her
Sure Home Secretary will appoint good range of independent people to historic child abuse panel including victims to complement Fiona Woolf
People now trying 2 undermine Fiona Woolf should ask themselves if they really want  inquiry to happen or delay 4 yrs by attacking each name
Delighted Home Sec has appointed Fiona Woolf to lead historic child abuse inquiry-now lets rally behind her and get this show on the road
@JonathanWest_ Already under a duty of care thru the Children Act & subject to inspectorates-swamping agencies will be counter-productive
@YEUK2012 I thought I already had
Have just made point in puppy farming debate that we need more people to look at option of homing rescue dogs rather than just buying pups
Listening 2 Labour MP Robert Floello making strong case in Commons debate on tougher regulation 4 sale of puppies and kittens-lot of support
@19JH68 I hope not
@CliveAndrews health charity cycling promotion in the Commons!
@VickiWindslow it will depend on timing
@Mezzz @pupaid what is rude and aggressive is you masquerading as a constituent in order to be abusive & refusing 2 answer a simple question
Why I have today presented a Bill in Parliament to give full equality on civil partnerships for opposite sex couples http://t.co/1HXRnK8kKd
@Mezzz @pupaid I don't use twitter to respond to anonymous people on issues. What is rude is staying anonymous-are you a constituent or not?
@Mezzz @pupaid if you are a comstituent you will know how to email me
National Audit Office report finds proportion of 16-18 yr olds not in employment education or training is lowest since records began.

http://t.co/C7fsEQhnBz
Relieved to here that arrest warrant against Ashya's parents has been dropped & @Jeremy_Hunt intervening to get family urgent medical advice
@TheBethThomas Send me an email with details
Now Labour Party jumping on bandwagon of mandatory reporting of child abuse which could clog up the whole system and be counter-productive
Last tweet has broken link, see my expanded comments on the Ashya King case here: http://t.co/ax5KGnN2Im
My expanded comments on the Ashya King case 
http://t.co/WnsSw5L4qg
@LordNortonLouth @LordCourtown It was tongue in cheek but to be fair you don't have constituents
@suesspiciousmin can't see how this can be a child protection case-abusive parents don't tend 2 sell their homes 2 fund lifesaving operation
By the end of the day CPS needs to drop case against Ashya's family, Hampshire Police apologise & NHS offer 2 fund treatment in CZ or in UK
@LordCourtown Quite right too - you lot are still on holiday. We have work to do!
@tomdaylight @georgeeaton bloody cheek - we all had to wear earpieces because of sound problems in the new studio
Just spoken in Commons 2 change regulations 2 allow Mitochondrial donation 2 combat horrible inherited disease affecting 6500 children pa
I'm wearing my gold ribbon to support Childhood Cancer Awareness Month organised by excellent http://t.co/UN9rBQ9Ho3 http://t.co/k0B3cNHVqf
@Carl_Chassereau there is absolutely no prospect of it going away but need to have rights members on panel who have everyone's confidence
@JanTallis @Hands_Border yes-qualifies because he is at university there but unlikley still to be by time independence vote would go through
Adur Council officers did great job cleaning up Southwick Green early this morning after latest traveller incursion http://t.co/r8aZZBHhcQ
Stopped off @Hands_Border cairn at Gretna Green with wife born in Scotland (can't vote) & son born in London (can) http://t.co/IqW7IgquH0
At Auld Acquaintance Cairn we added Worthing flint, South Downs chalk, Sussex clay tile & pebbles from Shoreham Beach @Hands_Border
@GuidoFawkes The Clinton book was actually a good read - you're welcome to inspect my well thumbed copy with sun tan lotion marks on!
Pleased 2 hear Southwick Green is now clear of illegally encamped travellers and not before time-well done Southwick cllrs 4 keeping on case
Some of Southwick Green travellers moved on albeit only to Albion St lorry park. Rest facing court proceedings next week. Need Section 61 b4
@Paulo_Coimbra_ we will tweet something later
@anthonygray57 cos
most of them will inevitably be baseless referrals  from professionals covering their backs which will clog up the system
@Paulo_Coimbra_ it's happening now by the Green
@ChildrensComm @guardian Keir's analysis of Rotherham problem is good but mandatory reporting not the answer & could be counter-productive
@PeterMcC66 there was no Lisbon Treaty by time of election as u well know so stop lying-the only ones who will scupper referendum is UKIP
@cafe_tomtom d'oh yes you did since when UKIP have tried to put up council tax and slash highways budget locally #absenteeopposition
@cafe_tomtom err their vote actually went down this year whilst ours went up in local councils!
@LiarMPs whether u believe it or not from DC & you should, it is what the vast majority of Tory MPs want & will make happen if we r in Govt
@PeterMcC66 That is just not true & if it doesn't happen by 2017 then there will be many Tory MPs rebelling
Disappointed police havent been able 2 disperse traveller encampment on Southwick Green yet-have asked them 2 give resident briefing 2morrow
Whatever u think about Cameron he's first Tory leader 2 pledge straight In/Out EU ref, not even Mrs T did-only backing UKIP can scupper it
Glad 2 see charities @barnardos urging Govt 2 get on with historic child abuse enq-shame werent as vociferous when I was urging it 2 yrs ago
@stuart264 ultimately yes of course
@all_sweetness It's an important point and I know failure to do this has caused annoyance to other communities of Asian origin
On Newsnight later talking about the Rotherham child abuse scandal
How the mighty have fallen-bumped into William Hague in Portcullis House canteen ordering fish finger hot dog for lunch!
Shocking Rotherham report shows systemic failure police & council putting political correctness ahead protecting vulnerable kids over 20 yrs
@IainDale @JohnSimmonsDale It's a scream. #lightenup
@Phillip_D_Jones @ZacGoldsmith shockingly probably only the tip of the iceberg too, have just commented on LBC
@twinkbat @SamFoxCom @dhewlett @OfficialBHAFC have already been iced and donated to MND and St Wilfrids Hospice!
Glad to attend the launch of Latest TV which next week will bring local news coverage to our TVs along Sussex coast http://t.co/RELMl3urJF

Troubled families=one of Govt's bravest game changing progs yet today has put up junior minister from wrong dept & civil servant 2 defend it
@MindyWattUK @martinnarey @EdwardTimpson1 an important point which is why adoption support resources are greater than ever & well targeted
@SainsburysPR No you have the wrong date. Might be better to clear first before going public next time
@danjago @florajago  Couldn't your father have done better than that? I know Tesco going through a tough time at the moment but really!
@SainsburysPR that's news to me!

@joerayment91 @Mike_Fabricant you're having a laugh aren't you?
@Chris_Hoyle_ @mazzie1111 @AshcroftBen Thanks Chris- this was an important campaign and it is a disgrace if such practice is still happening
2/2 clear objective 2 eliminate ISIS militia & liberate fleeing Christians 2 place of safety; clear good guys & UK allies in form of Kurds
1/2 Unlike Syria last year there is clear case for military action in N Iraq & arming Kurds - clear target in genocidal ISIS militia;
If ECHR believes prisoners should vote but UK can decide which ones qualify why don't we give vote 2 anyone serving sentence of under 2 days
Unemployed claimants in E Worthing & Shoreham in July 2014 was 829-a rate of 1.7% of the economically active pop & 444 down on July 2013
@AlistairJones9 Best start by deciding who you want to help and why
@JacobWilkinson I think that's my point
@DaveLarkhall @BathCA naturally but only if he is a winner because at the moment there is a lot of hype & of course Boris Island is closer
@JacobWilkinson quite right 2 so perhaps Uxbridge could offer a job swap for our S Thanet candidate such has been the presumption over Bojo
@davechapman49 in which case he will not be as good as he is cracked up to be David and everyone should not be getting so excited
If Farage confirmed as Election candidate in Thanet South strikes me that is obvious place for Boris to stand & make for a proper contest
@mrandrewgunner @SouthernRailUK @Shoreham_Herald @shorehambysea well done for pointing this out
@PaulGoodmanCH except when it comes to recognising the unflinching loyalty and long term contribution of one Keith Simpson MP AGAIN
@chrisstacey1 of course
@CliveAndrews i am currently away on holiday but have written something for my website
@LPerrins she was selected  2 stand against me in E Worthing & Shoreham 4 the last election whilst still at school at  grand old age of 17
@jax1996 I gather Lancing Parish Council initiated legal proceedings last week which will hopefully allow action this coming week
@WyeLea @Tearfund I hope so but probably less than UKIP
Happy to support Amnesty International's campaign against torture in Shoreham this morning (not torture in Shoreham!) http://t.co/7AYP7gdbBK
Here's a couple taking advantage of the road closure for this morning's delightful Italian market in Shoreham http://t.co/IIqDK8bo41
@Tearfund working with Medair in Jordan 2 provide water 4 Syrian refugee camps-will write up report in my newsletter http://t.co/CHXwZumOV2

Zaatari refugee camp now Jordan's 4th largest 'city'- Oxfam & other aid agencies doing brilliant job 4 86,000 Syrians http://t.co/NQT7N0NuJd

Just returned from Jordan trip with excellent humanitarian charity @Tearfund doing a fantastic job looking after fleeing Syrian refugees
Sorry to hear news about Cmdr Sarah West on HMS Portland - when she commanded HMS Shoreham she did an excellent job
Thanx 2 police & Adur unauthorised traveller encampments at Southwick Rec, Buckingham Park School & Sompting Rec were all removed swiftly
Toured all illegal encampment sites in Adur earlier today and all moved on except Monks Rec Lancing which Parish Council are dealing with
Great to meet up with@ambitiontalk youth council at Hindleap to discuss strengthening youth voice @CitadelComms http://t.co/IB3m4zYy5l
@LaurennSugdenn On my way home from abroad now & will visit soon but gather they moved on earlier this afternoon & Council have been on site
@_liammills pleasure - happy birthday Liam
@WilliamJHague @PaulGoodmanCH &great pity that this ever loyal & experienced Minister in waiting has been passed over 4 promotion yet again
@WorthingDaily Jason Hannah JHannah@worthinghigh.net
Street surgery @ Lancing Childrens Centre 10-12 as usual whatever the weather followed by Worthing Town Centre from 12.15pm with local cllrs
Hope the weather picks up for Broadwater Carnival 10-4 today with procession arriving at Broadwater Green at 2pm
@WorthingDirect Or to put it more accurately MP slams parish council for treating council taxpayers & elected respresentatives with contempt
Useful updates on illegal traveller encampments in Adur & Worthing available here http://t.co/i68kwf3l2K
@m1cksacc except we have been making it more and more difficult and they now know they will meet with a robust response
Glad to report that police served a Section 61 notice on the illegal encampment on Adur Rec and the travellers have left-clean up underway
@mattforde hic!!
@mattforde You will have to wait until I do Daily Politics later this morning!
@IsabelHardman It was the one before last in fact
@grantshapps @DJSkelton Or perhaps that should be fewer! Education Secretary has only been gone half an hour!
@ejntaylor No - thanks for letting me know. Will investigate
@mrkpurvis Thank you but don't hold your breath
@minforcivsoc @Lotte_IWill Nick's departure will leave a huge gap in the youth sector-one of the few to understand it and earn their respect
@NadineDorriesMP Its a plot - mine has given up the ghost too
Hot weekend in constituency. Birdman launches off Worthing Pier at 11.30am Saturday & its Shoreham Chilli festival http://t.co/slXlsJlgcE
Regular Farmer's Market street surgery in Shoreham this saturday 10-12 with Conservative cllrs and me. All welcome
2/2 paint it over, then a year later voted not to paint it over. Another Dibley classic waste of time and taxpayers money. #failagain
1/2 Last year Dibley Council  paid for a mural on their premises without consulting their neighbours who had to look at it, then voted to...
Dibley Council(AKA Sompting Parish) have already banned public from using technology at council meetings now they want 2 ban free speech too
Does anyone actually know what is the point of Dibley Parish Council (AKA Sompting Parish)? Fast becoming an expensive embarrassment
So Dibley Council (AKA Sompting Parish) waste time & taxpayers money discussing how to censor elected representatives talking about Dibley
Fun piece @MatthewParris3 On losing an argument with Tim Loughton http://t.co/r5BJwnUBna but he's still wrong & time will make him wronger
Frankly if the Queen was appointed to head the inquiry someone would be crying foul about conflicts of interest
Do we actually want 2 have an inquiry into historic child sex abuse or do we want  argue about how it is constituted for the next 6 months?
If I was Home Secretary I would appoint Elizabeth Butler-Sloss-anyone who has worked with her could not doubt her integrity or independence
Elizabeth Butler-loss won't be a one woman show-inquiry panel will have a strong team experts which must include survivor's representative
If Elizabeth Butler-Sloss is forced to stand down b4 she has even started her replacement will no doubt be challenged & the one after that
Elizabeth Butler-Sloss is one of the few people able to steer & focus the inquiry into something meaningful so let's get on with it
Why Govt should've been on right side of call 4 child abuse inq earlier & Theresa May has seized back the initiative http://t.co/1k5cjTe65Q
#1001CriticalDays. APPG Conception to Age 2 meets today in Parliament to launch NEW perinatal enquiry with @WAVE_Trust. and me chairing
2/2 .. may require legislation but we already have duty of care legislation in Children's Acts. Better approach than mandatory reporting
1/2 Good to see NSPCC supporting my calls from Monday to make sure wilful covering up of child sex abuse is pursued as much as perpetrators
How the historic child abuse campaign was won but now the hard work of the inquiry begins http://t.co/LfjqCPPNEj
Elizabeth Butler-Sloss is an excellent choice to head historic child sex abuse inquiry-great expertise and greatly respected
@mlilleker @mwilliamsthomas yes -she has done well in contrast to other cabinet ministers who just yesterday were saying no need for inquiry
The new inquiry we have been asking for must have the flexibility to be able to go where it needs to go & tackle those guilty of cover up 2
The power of 141 MPs, social media & a Home Secretary who gets it over historic child abuse means today's announcement is major step forward
Well done & thanks to Theresa May who almost uniquely seems to have grasped the gravity of these never ending child abuse revelations
@mwilliamsthomas no that's not what she announced
@PaulGoodmanCH @ConHome and some of us asked the PM for it on Con Home as far back as November 2012 Paul and so much has come out since
My open letter to the PM as far back as 2012 urging him to institute an overarching inquiry into historic child abuse http://t.co/4j1ZdmpTLS
@DavidSalocin I will ask your councillors
Shame Labour frontbench now appear to be trying to score party political points on child abuse scandal as I predicted
Welcome review being announced by Home Secretary today-shows we are making progress
@IainDale a low bar!
@IainDale why thank you!
oh dear - HIGNFY repeat on now with someone familiar
@stephs36 yes and to the police
@commer2stroke @BehaviourA It's a Worthing canvasser's suntan. Not been away this year
@NewHarpsichord We had to do enough retakes the first time!
@timsykes3 where have you been? I have been calling for little else this week
More shocking revelations about historic missing files at the Home office in tomorrow's Telegraph
@cortina Except I haven't
@BlueZep @frederickJWill2 No they won't and that sort of menacing behaviour really does not help our cause
@lucyallan sounds interesting
Good meeting with Basepoint today to discuss way forward to resolve Ropetackle signage issue
Pretty impressed with my multitasking on Daily Politics-at least I didn't get stuck on the zip wire like someone http://t.co/n4LITNz0IT
The number of MPs now calling for an overarching inquiry into child sex abuse has just passed 140 with pressure building in press today
Extra street surgery tomorrow with local councillors in Southwick Square from 10am
@_LisaCherry Thanks
@SueAtkins can we email
@SueAtkins happy to meet up
@HollyByTheSea clearly your prejudice prevents you from actually listening to what I said-I specifically made no distinction between couples
2/2 turns out it was real & cllrs are 2 waste more council taxpayers money discussing it on Wednesday. Do go along if no better comedy on TV
1/2 Received hoax letter claiming 2 be from Dibley Parish Council (AKA Sompting Parish) trying to censor my communications with constituents
@Samsmethers don't think she did either Sam!
About to go on Newsnight about historic child abuse...again
On the Daily Politics tomorrow talking on challenges facing kids growing up today & filmed in a playground in South London #multitasking
Will be on Channel 4 News and @BBCNewsnight later talking about need for overarching inquiry into historic child sex abuse

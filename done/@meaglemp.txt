Tories move procedural motion to commit Bill to select Cttee instead of standing cttee. This would effectively delay it. #bedroomtax
Result of 2R vote on #bedroomtax : aye 306 No 231 Bill goes into committee. So much for Tory whipping operation!
Tories LOSE on #bedroomtax We should now get the Bill into Committee. So much for Tory 3 line whip! Vote on 2nd reading now.

And if you think that's bizarre - on a serious note - here are his party leader's views on #climatechange #UKIP http://t.co/zsPn1zN2TG Mon Apr 27 17:25:11 BST 2015
UKIP candidate also told bizarre story about how he "urinates in a bottle" 2 cut his carbon footprint (I kid you not) at hustings yesterday! Mon Apr 27 17:22:25 BST 2015
.@JaniceFionaBell @welshlabour @EmmaWarman unfortunately - false - I heard him say what reported on website. UKIP said as reported too. Mon Apr 27 16:25:12 BST 2015

.@RTaylorUK @TheyWorkForYou @mysociety series of problems with the analysis + how presented on some of your sites - would be good to discuss Mon Apr 20 22:35:44 BST 2015
.@RTaylorUK @PenartharByd the summary you have done on tax avoidance is partial - I have repeatedly voted to tighten tax loopholes Mon Apr 20 22:32:24 BST 2015
.@RTaylorUK @PenartharByd on Lords reform - the vote listed was on very specific issue re offences by Lords - not wholescale "reform" Mon Apr 20 22:30:20 BST 2015
.@RTaylorUK @PenartharByd exactly - but that's very misleading given the amount of parliamentary work and voting that goes on in committee Mon Apr 20 22:27:36 BST 2015
.@PenartharByd their stats are not accurate on many issues because a) don't include committees and b) I was only in parliament 2.5 years Mon Apr 20 21:55:29 BST 2015
.@PenartharByd in the last parliament - I have no idea how the stats have been calculated - eg on tax avoidance they are simply wrong 2/2 Mon Apr 20 21:28:45 BST 2015
.@PenartharByd what a load of rubbish... I have never been able to vote on some of the issues eg House of Lords - as they never came up 1/2 Mon Apr 20 21:27:38 BST 2015

Still waiting @David_Cameron - will you debate @Ed_Miliband one on one? Yes or No? #runningscared #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 22:01:23 BST 2015

Ed lays down the gauntlet to Cameron "debate me - one on one!" #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:29:38 BST 2015
Ed and @UKLabour only leader and party who will stand up for every person and every part of our country #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:24:31 BST 2015
Sturgeon is SO deeply disingenuous... All she wants is another referendum and chance to break up our country #BBCDebate #VoteSNPgetTories Thu Apr 16 21:21:28 BST 2015
Only way to guarantee getting rid of Tories is to vote Labour - absolute nonsense from SNP - who only care about one thing... #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:17:38 BST 2015
Farage is telling lies on NHS - just watch video - he wants insurance based system and privatisation: http://t.co/q09Bj39fwm #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:11:07 BST 2015
Ed absolutely spot on about Farage and #UKIP: "you want to exploit people's fears...not address them" #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:06:28 BST 2015
We are stronger + safer because one country + part of EU, NATO and UN - breaking up UK or pulling out of EU would be disaster #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:54:59 BST 2015

@duncanm90 ummm - no - I am referring to his confidence, grasp of the issues, and calm tone and demeanour #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:30:53 BST 2015
Ed is only one who looks and sounds like a Prime Minister... And the current Prime Minister was too scared to debate him head on #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:26:48 BST 2015
Farage looking and sounding faltering and tired #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:08:07 BST 2015

I don't think most people like this personal nastiness from Paxo or Tories - you could hear groans from audience #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:25:04 GMT 2015
Audience really liking Ed on foreign policy answers #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:23:45 GMT 2015
Ed v strong back at Paxo - working people are £1,600 a year worse off under Tories. #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:15:43 GMT 2015
Spot on Ed: I would give Cameron fair credit on #equalmarriage #0.7% too #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:01:41 GMT 2015
Ed is upbeat, honest and frank - complete contrast to Cameron #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:57:01 GMT 2015

He doesn't look very happy... #Cameron #BattleForNo10 @SkyNews @Channel4 Thu Mar 26 21:45:23 GMT 2015
'Broken promises...how can we trust you?' - spot on from the audience. #BattleForNo10 @SkyNews @Channel4 Thu Mar 26 21:42:16 GMT 2015

Cameron literally doesn't get it on #zerohours totally out of touch + reverting back to script lines already #runningscared #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:06:12 GMT 2015

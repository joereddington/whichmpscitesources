Was v. interesting discussion RT @albanyassociate: Albany’s Hot Topic Review: Who’s Problem is ISIS http://t.co/oKUbtefJYI #ISIS #Iraq
#StratfordTraffic Cllr Seccombe says this is a problem that goes back decades due to no overall plan for the flow of traffic in Stratford
#StratfordTraffic started by saying this is the first step and very important that these meetings are in public
Wrapping up #StratfordTraffic I am committing to you to get back with a date for a next meeting & follow up actions
#StratfordTraffic The experts may be there but we must pay attention to the wisdom of the people of stratford & their views
#StratordTraffic: My (Nadhim’s) question to the county council is when will we have a plan and solution.  What’s the deadline
#StratfordTraffic Could we have another look at new traffic lights on Clopton road. Could we have an undertaking this will happen tonight
#StratfordTraffic Questioner: Many people have asked about a ring road do the people up there have any intention of doing something about it
#StratfordTraffic Questioner: Can we please have a date on at least one thing. When will this traffic modelling be completed
@GreenJimll Great to have you here #StratfordTraffic
#StratfordTraffic we need our core strategy in place to protect us, but I have got concessions from gov on infrastructure delivery
#StratfordTraffic Questioner: It’s ironic we have all contributed to the traffic by coming here tonight, majority have come in cars
#StratfordTraffic Questioner: People protest and write objections on housing and things just get overridden by Sec of State & Inspectorate
@robert_omalley Was certainly more popular in the room than bus lanes
#StratfordTraffic Cllr Seccombe says she thinks its about 10 years since Stratford applied to central government for money  for bypass
@Moetjouet #StratfordTraffic Cllr Seccombe and Butlin have said we need the core strategy in place to help give us a joined up approach
#StratfordTraffic more traffic lights for clop ton road/ banbury road proposed that officers say will balance traffic more
#StratfordTraffic Suggestions we should have bus lanes(not universally popular with the room) and more cycle lanes to get people out of cars
#StratfordTraffic Graeme Fitton says they have looked at many solutions for a bypass over the years
@TheMainstand #StratfordTraffic is a public meeting being held tonight to discuss the traffic problems in Stratford Upon Avon
#StratfordTraffic follows on with, we need to talk solutions, and shouldn't underestimate the issues with day trippers coming into town
#Stratfordtraffic next questioner am I the only person to see the irony of so many people standing and the congestion in this room.
#StratfordTraffic the room is 50:50 split on whether Stratford should have less or more pedestrianisation http://t.co/m2KIFVbnqV
#StratfordTraffic next questioner: why don't we have a proper bypass, followed by why are we pedestrianising Stratford by stealth
#StratfordTraffic have asked him to check that they are actually in sync and sequenced as driving up Birmingham road that doesn't seem case
#StratfordTraffic Graeme Fitton head of highways says that traffic signals in town are connected to much disagreement in the room.
#StratfordTraffic next questioner: Birmingham road isn't only issue, who agreed Long Marston could become a lorry park
#StratfordTraffic Ex town cllr Bill Lowe says why can't we have relief road to wellesbourne where there is then a bridge already at barflies
#StratfordTraffic Cllr Seccombe says that for over 50 years we have needed a second crossing over the river Avon
... It will have weight and provide us with immediate protection
#StratfordTraffic my understanding is that  our core strategy should be ready for submission by September Minister confirmed last week...
#StratfordTraffic Next question "when will we get a Core strategy if that is the issue"
#StratfordTraffic next questioner says SDC and WCC have made a mess of the Birmingham road because too much development no infrastructure
#stratfordtraffic George asks the 1st question "raises issues with positioning on bus stops on Alcester road blocking traffic"
#stratfordTraffic Cllr Butlin (portfolio holder for highways) talks about how lack of a local plan has led to piecemeal infrastructure
Cllr Seccombe begins by saying that this is an issue that goes back decades due to no strategic plan for flow of traffic #StratfordTraffic
Follow my traffic summit and join in on #StratfordTraffic

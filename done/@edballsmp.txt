We should be helping all families & not just some - @RachelReevesMP on Tory tax breaks for 1/3rd of married couples http://t.co/1AhenQklTZ
Shocking that David Cameron has announced a tax cut (for 1/3 of married couples) without saying how to pay for it - fails the OBR test..
Women lose when David Cameron cuts  child benefit/credit, but men the beneficiaries from his marriage tax break (1/3 of married men that is)
If a man abuses his wife, leaves and gets remarried, then he gets David Cameron's tax break and she loses out.. Love is love?
Of course it's insulting that £3.85 a week would persuade anyone to get married. And the money will be paid mainly to men not women..
With David Cameron, the truth is always so different from the spin - 2/3 of married couples won't benefit from his tax break (nor widows)..

After 3yrs of flatlining, growth welcome & long overdue - but still no recovery in family living standards: http://t.co/mP5uXXAGQx
Good meetings in Washington DC with US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Ben Bernanke at the Fed & Gene Sperling at the White House
In UK, while millionaires have been given a huge tax cut, for everyone else life is getting harder - prices rising much faster than wages
But here in US, where much stronger growth, still same deep concern as in Britain about  squeeze on living standards for ordinary families
Over the last 3 years, the US has grown nearly 3 times faster than the UK - America 3% above pre-crisis peak, UK stilll over 3% below
After 3 damaging years of flatlining, this growth is both welcome & long overdue. But still no recovery in family living standards.

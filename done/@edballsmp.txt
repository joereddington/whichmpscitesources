That moment when David Cameron defended 1.8 million zero-hours contracts and Ed Miliband pledged to change the status quo was v significant Thu Apr 02 21:52:30 BST 2015
David Cameron almost completely silent in this debate - even when audience loudly applauds Ed Miliband for calling him on bank regulation Thu Apr 02 21:44:35 BST 2015

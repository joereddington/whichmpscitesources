Astonishing that at a time of cuts and austerity Britain's Tory Chancellor is in the courts fighting for bankers' bonuses to be bigger
@JC_W12 @meaglemp Labour created the NHS and has defended it ever since
@simplem_ths but that's not ironic is it, since Croydon's part of London
@simplem_ths @GavinBarwellMP Croydon is part of London!

Meanwhile Tory by-election leaflet links immigrants with fear of crime, this scapegoating of immigrants by UKIP and Tories is dangerous
Disgusted to see UKIP by-election candidate talk about repatriating immigrants who work hard and pay tax here.  Divisive & offensive.
@AndrewFisher79 the contributory principle was part of the foundation of the welfare state because it's about fairness
@bigcentrehalf I wasn't an MP then and agree it was wrong
@MargoJMilne @RachelReevesMP @UKLabour it's fair that benefits shouldn't pay more than average wages otherwise it's a disincentive to work
@gdm1927 @YvetteCooperMP er... to put names on a database you need border staff to collect and input the data...
@MargoJMilne @RachelReevesMP @UKLabour These proposals strengthen the welfare system for British citizens when they need it

@gdm1927 @SBalbriggan @YvetteCooperMP because currently there aren't enough border guards to check who's coming in and leaving
@gdm1927 @SBalbriggan @YvetteCooperMP it only applies to visitors with a visa waiver so they won't have paid anything
@SBalbriggan @YvetteCooperMP a £10 levy on visitors

Labour will use opposition debate next week to give MPs a vote on European Arrest Warrant that Cameron/May denied them

@TheMosh____e no - in Parliamentary language that actually means something !

@ClevanJohnson I'm going to sleep now - you coming on the bus to Rochester byelection tomorrow? Leaves Brewers Green 9:15am
@ClevanJohnson we have recall at every general election anyway; this is to deal with MPs who do wrong in between
@ClevanJohnson @bieneosa ps I didn't vote for the Tory MP's amendment, I will be voting for recall
@ClevanJohnson here are Hilary Benn's views about it which I think are sensible http://t.co/oDwFojlsLH
@ClevanJohnson shd only happen if a higher number call for it to prevent party political recalls, and only if there is wrongdoing
@ClevanJohnson the fact just 3000 people cd trigger it without any wrongdoing is too low. Most MPs cd be recalled by well funded opponents
@ClevanJohnson I support recall, but Zac Goldsmith's amendments were not reasonable. I intend to support the final bill.

@AtSeSu email me (if you're in Croydon North) and I'll contact the council for you, or you cd try the council directly yourself
@ao_thwaites the victims organisation suggested someone highly respected and fully independent like Helena Kennedy or Michael Mansfield
Fiona Woolf right to quit, but huge questions now over Theresa May's repeated failure to pick abuse inquiry head acceptable to victims
@JohnLoony so you'd abolish lifeguards on beaches so people don't swim in dangerous seas? What nonsense. This is quite simply wicked
Theresa May in trouble yet again as child abuse victims call for inquiry head to go after HomeOffice helped downplay links to Leon Brittan
Absolutely shocking that the Tory immigration minister wants to leave N African immigrants to drown in the sea.

Interesting debate at #LocalGov Assoc about English devolution
@JamesMBooker wonder if that's good or bad! (Or just a stylistic error...)
@MandyHall64 @deanofsurrey I'm glad we agree :-)
@MandyHall64 @deanofsurrey what if the providers include community based social enterprises and not-for-profit organisations?
@MandyHall64 that's more to do with low levels of funding and lack of accountability to patients
@MandyHall64 @deanofsurrey do you think no private company ever delivers good quality services?
@Audere2010 that's my point - we have to make sure profits get reinvested in services
@Audere2010 profit is just a surplus of income over costs, profit isn't the issue, it's what you do with it (eg reinvest or not)
@Audere2010 every GP is a private contractor, they're not NHS employees
@Audere2010 we shd trust patients, but level playing field is key, need to look at how tariffs operate as can unfairly help private
@conViktion not sure it's dodging, but if you're not v careful how u say things in public it can get twisted & deliberately misinterpreted
@Audere2010 you don't trust patients to choose NHS providers if they're given a choice? I think they wd as long as level playing field
Simon Stevens want patients to have more choice over health services and providers, fits with @Ed_Miliband's "people power" agenda
@conViktion was less convinced about paying GPs for each dementia case they diagnose - risk of misdiagnosis, good GPs diagnose anyway

@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate my view is the council shd have opposed the application
@MarioCreatura the council operates within parameters set by Govt, that's not news, and nor does it mean you can't campaign #complacent
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate what nonsense, you actually think we shdnt campaign against planning decisions? No wonder Tory council failed
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate standing up for residents is better than complacently letting them lose out which is Croydon Tory approach
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate rubbish, council can put pressure on govt to change rules. You have zero ambition
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate you & Barwell cravenly supported every failure of defeated Tory administration but I will stand up for CNorth
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate spinning out of control. We were petitioning against the expansion and I think council/govt wrong to allow it
@MarioCreatura @ArfurZTowcrate and I will be saying what I think about the council, not adopting Barwell's craven & complacent approach
@MarioCreatura so you don't think saying you've frozen allowances while secretly taking £11k more is resigning matter or ££ shd be repaid?
@MarioCreatura as a Croydon cllr are you calling on Cllr Fisher to repay the £11k secret pay he took and to resign from the council?

@standuppete @GalaReiver I disagree, here's my article explaining why we need devolution from Westminster  http://t.co/Uq6KhZoTK2
@standuppete @GalaReiver no, there's no need for additional tiers of govt, you can devolve to groupings of councils in cities & regions
@ANNEGILES that doesn't mean everyone else can - I get many complaints about long waits in C North
@SilConCroy it links to official HMRC report where £35bn figure comes from. That's the Govt's own figures.

He's done it again, fantastic speech. @Ed_Miliband makes the case for a Labour govt with him as PM: together we can rebuild our country

@MarioCreatura @PetersWooll @GavinBarwellMP what % do you think support Fisher paying back his £11k secret pay?
@PetersWooll @GavinBarwellMP because he's not interested in England only in a political stitch-up to appease rebellious right-wing Tory MPs

@GavinBarwellMP do you agree Fisher shd resign from council over shameful #secretpay policy you welcomed and yr staff voted for?
@GavinBarwellMP so do I as part of wider decentralisation. They don't agree with PM breaking solemn vow to Scots by introducing conditions
@andalg1 @carolellington1 parliament doesn't sit while party conferences are on
@GavinBarwellMP fairness. Another concept the Tories find "weird"?
@ANNEGILES @GavinBarwellMP I think that since he didn't declare it, pretended he'd frozen his pay and it wasn't budgeted for, he should
@GavinBarwellMP says a lot about Tories that engaging citizens in a debate about their own country is "weird". Learnt nothing from Scotland
@GavinBarwellMP you haven't answered about citizen led English constitutional convention. Doesn't Central Office have a line on that yet?
@davidwhite020 it's exactly that alas, but his Scottish MPs will be fearful of backlash if he doesn't.
@GavinBarwellMP will u support cross party citizen-led constitutional convention Labour has proposed instead of politician-led stitch-up?
@GavinBarwellMP yr party is engaged in a party political fix that discredits politics. Scotland debated 2yrs, why only 4 months for England?
@GavinBarwellMP as part of a wider English devolution that gets many of those decisions out of Parliament, but England needs to debate this
@davidwhite020 I hope the LDems will stand with Labour on this one. Clegg signed the vow too.
@Pas_chez_moi for Cameron to fall back into Westminster political fixing so soon after his arrogance nearly broke the union is shocking
@GavinBarwellMP and has cllr Fisher paid back the £11k secret pay yet? When will he do that?
@GavinBarwellMP and a fix to silence English Tory MPs is nothing like the radical empowerment of people that's needed
@GavinBarwellMP funny he didn't mention that b4 referendum, England needs longer than 4 months to debate new constitutional settlement
Disgraceful that Cameron already threatening to break his vow to Scotland in attempt to secure narrow party advantage. This PM has no shame
@Guineveretoo yes it is difficult - I lost track of who'd said what! Anyway enjoy yr evening
@Guineveretoo ok, we've had a good discussion now, I'm going for some food, enjoy yr evening & thx for caring about the ppl in the hotel
@Guineveretoo also I have concerns about the hotel - am getting facts on that then will go public
@Guineveretoo ok fair enough, I understand your concerns. But other ppl are genuinely worried too. The HOffice shdnt have done this
@Guineveretoo "potentially"
@Guineveretoo @PalaceGipsy I'm pleased, I raised concerns about squalid conditions in hotel and impact on small community. Seems fair enough
@PalaceGipsy @Guineveretoo you've read all the letters I've received about this have you?
@Guineveretoo well, I cd tell you but if I put details on here you'd accuse me of sensationalising!
@Guineveretoo I'm not going to tell the people who have complained to me you think they're racist because you object to what they've seen
@Guineveretoo @PalaceGipsy I'm an MP not a journalist, I only know what people have told me
@Guineveretoo @PalaceGipsy I raised concerns about overcrowding and lack of proper care and support for them
@PalaceGipsy @Guineveretoo if I put on my blog all the things people aren't reporting it wd be a bit odd
@Guineveretoo that's kind of you but you can't call people racist just for raising a legitimate concern, many were genuinely worried
@PalaceGipsy @Guineveretoo we'll have to disagree I'm afraid, I'm always going to represent my constituents not cover things up they raise
@PalaceGipsy @Guineveretoo so you'd rather I gave the press dozens of detailed examples to sensationalise! That wdnt be a good idea
@HarleyM65 good idea I'll do a follow up next week
@Guineveretoo that's a sweeping generalisation and very insulting about many of your neighbours!
@HarleyM65 it's a typical DMail spin sadly, Mirror's coverage far better
@Guineveretoo I'd spoken to dozens of people who contacted me to complain. Where does this nonsense come from?
@Guineveretoo I'm afraid I disagree. Censoring things you don't find convenient leads to trouble. It was behind the cover up in Rotherham
@HarleyM65 what has Mail said? Haven't seen it. The Mirror covered it very fairly. Real concerns about overcrowding by hotel owners
@Guineveretoo so you think I shouldn't talk about things that dozens of residents complain to me about? Cover it all up?
@PalaceGipsy it's both ASB and overcrowding in hotel. Pretending things don't happen because it's not PC is what led to Rotherham scandal
@PalaceGipsy I didn't give examples precisely because they wd sensationalise it. You'd prefer me to ignore what my constituents tell me?
CroydonAd accuses @GavinBarwellMP of "grossly unfair" political point-scoring against @LabourSJ over child's death http://t.co/fr8sg4I64G
@PalaceGipsy nonsense, the press contacted me first and I've been at pains to say our community is diverse and welcoming
@PalaceGipsy hm, I've had dozens of letters and emails reporting concerns. Do you think they're not being truthful?
@Guineveretoo I didn't, I'd already written to the Home Office then the press contacted me. Why did you say it was the other way round?
@abeesty1 @electoralreform we need to demand a process people can take part in to agree a new constitutional settlement for England

@davidwhite020 getting circular. The proposals for devolved city regions & people powered public services were made months ago.
@davidwhite020 it looks like narrow nationalism to me. There's so much more we can be if we stay together but devolve the centralised state
@davidwhite020 and so it is the start - we need a national dialogue about how this evolves, not top down prescriptions
@davidwhite020 I'm an internationalist, I believe in solidarity, narrow nationalism is a dangerous ideology. We will just have to disagree.
@lee_alley yes I'll do some more on that, was a community version of a BID
@davidwhite020 @Ed_Miliband he hasn't, all the proposals already announced as part of policy review
@lee_alley you're right - worth looking at that idea again. Is someone working on it? Think I called them community improvement districts

@CllrSimonHall so has @MarioCreatura been caught out fibbing again? On top of his party's behaviour over secret pay?
@JamieAudsley @CllrTony not moves anyone will want to witness I suspect!
@MarioCreatura yr question was based on a smear
@MarioCreatura answer what?
@ArfurZTowcrate you're right - I'm off to Thornton Heath festival. See you all down there!
@MarioCreatura says a cllr from a party caught out for having the same attitude towards public money that a thief has towards an open till
@MarioCreatura you shd apologise for smearing. On top of the Tory secret pay scandal. Isn't yr party's reputation locally low enough yet?
@UkThom @MarioCreatura Croydon Tories seem to operate a culture of smears and deception. They are a disgrace to their national party
@MarioCreatura Labour removed the Tories' #secretpay loophole at 1st cabinet meeting. Yr smears on top of yr party's deceit is shameful
Seems @MarioCreatura has been smearing again. Labour leader is freezing pay at level Fisher said he was getting before #secretpay exposed
Shocked and saddened to hear Jim Dobbin MP has died suddenly. Such a lovely man.
@MarioCreatura you don't think boasting about freezing allowances then trying to claim increases retrospectively is morally questionable?
@MarioCreatura but who voted through the policy in 2010 despite being warned it cd lead to claims for back pay later on? Every Tory cllr did
@MarioCreatura it's a political judgment that every voter will be asked to make in 4 yrs. For me, cleaner streets will be significant
@MarioCreatura didn't they put in claims for cash after Fisher explained how he had? Perhaps that's another thing the inquiry can establish
@MarioCreatura do you agree the other 4 Tory cllrs who tried to benefit from this allowances scam shd also resign?
@duona61 @ArfurZTowcrate @MarioCreatura there are still big questions over how Tories set up conspiracy to deceive voters. Inquiry needed.
@MarioCreatura I shall reserve judgment until I see how much services improve then I can decide if it's represented value for money.
@ANNEGILES @MarioCreatura @CroydonAd if he's honest it's up to the electorate to decide. The Tories were running a conspiracy to deceive
So pleased Ashya King is heading to Prague for the treatment his parents wanted. They are heroes who have been treated abominably
@MarioCreatura it wasn't one though was it. 5 Tories tried to claim, and the policy permitting it was supported by every Tory cllr
Huge and enthusiastic turnout for the opening celebrations of the Good Shepherd Church in Thornton Heath
@MarioCreatura @CllrTony @GavinBarwellMP your party was operating a culture of secret pay, it shd be open & transparent
@ANNEGILES @GavinBarwellMP the issue's not how much he earned, but that he said he earned less than he was actually claiming
@GavinBarwellMP and isn't Steve OConnell the highest paid cllr in London? Did he need even more?
@GavinBarwellMP it's astonishing they thought it appropriate to tell the public they'd frozen allowances then claim back pay in private
@Chris1966 @GavinBarwellMP the policy was designed so this cd happen. Labour warned against it, Tories voted it through
@GavinBarwellMP ok seen it now. So Vidhi Mohan and Steve O'Connell were among 4 other Tories who submitted claims for secret pay!
@GavinBarwellMP I haven't seen that, who else tried to benefit?
@GavinBarwellMP yes because there appears to have been attempt to bypass disclosure requirements, & we don't know who else tried to benefit
@GavinBarwellMP @AlanOlive1 did any other Tory cllrs submit a similar claim under this policy?
@GavinBarwellMP had you read allowances policy in 2010 b4 u welcomed it? Includes a line Fisher relied on to authorise secret payments
@StimpsonDavid he was a lovely bloke
@ArfurZTowcrate it's not just Fisher.  The whole Tory Group voted for this policy in 2010 after Labour warned what might happen: now it has
@AlanOlive1 @GavinBarwellMP if Tories had won in May wd secret pay have ever been exposed? Every Tory cllr voted for this murky policy 2010
@GavinBarwellMP do you support call for full inquiry to expose extent, how it happened, & whether other cllrs benefited or tried to?
@StimpsonDavid be great to meet up some time!
@ArfurZTowcrate need to know how policy got agreed, who benefited or tried to benefit, full extent of secret payments & how to avoid repeat
Every Croydon Tory cllr voted for policy that permitted secret pay and @GavinBarwellMP welcomed it. Need inquiry to expose how this happened

@GavinBarwellMP so you think a Tory cllr helping himself to £10k public money in secret isn't a resigning matter?
@GavinBarwellMP @AndrewRendle you could explain how they voted for it at cabinet and in full council without knowing what it meant
@AndrewRendle @GavinBarwellMP all Tory cllrs voted for it at full council, so either they knew or they don't check what they're voting for

@AndrewRendle @GavinBarwellMP we don't know whether they knew or not. Need a formal investigation to establish how this happened
@GavinBarwellMP they all voted through the paper that allowed Fisher to do this, so they either connived or weren't up to being in cabinet
@GavinBarwellMP Croydon's entire Tory cabinet voted to allow Fisher to award himself £10k public money in secret. Do you condemn them?
@GavinBarwellMP did you know about Cllr Fisher's secret £10k pay rise and do you support his demand for 'back pay'? http://t.co/wKezPTWmqV

@Robbill123 @GavinBarwellMP sadly for you those stats come from the library of the House of Commons
@Robbill123 @GavinBarwellMP you think this is unique to Croydon do you?
@Robbill123 @GavinBarwellMP you think 1100% more working people claiming housing benefits isn't benefits?
@GavinBarwellMP @Robbill123 still think it's "rubbish" or is it in fact a damning indictment of Tory failure? #povertyparty
@GavinBarwellMP @Robbill123 here you go: http://t.co/ajsyLrzxiQ
@Hepworthclare @daniboy104 @Robbill123 he's being defensive cos the Tories lost the seat (in local election votes) to Labour in May
@MarioCreatura @Robbill123 just as well that's not what I said then. You're being very defensive - bit worried about 2015 maybe?
@MarioCreatura @Robbill123 @GavinBarwellMP what's the Tory MP for Croydon South done btw?
@MarioCreatura @Robbill123 while I'm sure that's admirable it's not a jobs fair. I also launched this: http://t.co/BcNPL6bcgT
@Robbill123 @daniboy104 I'm the only Croydon MP that's held a jobs fair, the 2 Tory MPs haven't
@Robbill123 @daniboy104 you do know that MPs don't run their local area don't you?
UKIP beat Tories by 23% in Clacton in May. To see which other Tory MPs will defect look for similar results. http://t.co/769v2nHjN7
@SARAHTALKBACK that was 8 yrs ago to be fair, anyway I'm happy to chase the matter for you if you copy me in
@Robbill123 @daniboy104 this govt is creating a low wage, low skill economy which is why 1100% more Croydon people in work are on benefits
@SARAHTALKBACK Labour only won the council in May after 8 yrs under Tories, but pls email me details of yr problem and I'll try to help
@Robbill123 @daniboy104 they are in work but becoming poorer cos of this govt. We need to make work pay for everyone not just the elite
@SARAHTALKBACK the Lib Dems are part of this Govt, Labour aren't
@Robbill123 @daniboy104 most people on benefits (excluding pensioners) have jobs
@daniboy104 @Robbill123 correct - 1100% increase in working people forced to subsidise low pay with benefits in Croydon since Tories elected
@Robbill123 according to polls top issues are economy (jobs/cost of living), NHS & immigration.
@SARAHTALKBACK but you wdnt see improvement with Tories in govt! They cut police, underfunded schools, threatened the hospital & cut wages
Gen election 9 months away & the Tories are consumed by their Europe obsession while the country wants answers to the cost of living crisis
Tory split on EU bursts into the open as MP defects to UKIP in bid to push Cameron even further to the right
@keir_starmer v good on @BBCRadio4 - pointing fingers at individuals isn't enough, need to tackle culture of disbelief re abuse #Rotherham
Rotherham cllrs claiming they knew nothing of abuse: they shd have ensured mechanisms in place to alert them to safeguarding concerns
@Jos21 alas he's temporarily ensconced in Oregon!
@Ross_Brown_ they should! Might look a little self-serving if I do it though... Maybe she will do more concerts? hope so!
@RoyalUniverse @Albert_PrinceC in which case we wish him many happy returns!
Feeling very jealous of people with tickets for the fantastic Kate Bush this evening. Enjoy the show!

Thank goodness Israel and Hamas have signed up to the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire.  Let's hope this one sticks. http://t.co/IvxboFRA6J
@DeanBowyer1803 @GaryMerseybox @NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 there are extremists on both sides, but majority want peace
@GaryMerseybox @DeanBowyer1803 @NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 majority on both sides want peace, some extremist leaders don't so there's war
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 they s deny Israel's right to exist
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 right to exist means supporting Israel's existence, altho I think that shd be pre-occupation borders
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 Hamas say they want to destroy Israel and drive the Jews into the sea
@davidwhite020 @NuriaCorbi ha, we agree on that last point!
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 then you shd support a negotiated 2-state solution like I do. Peace and justice for Israel AND Palestine
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 so what does opposing Israel's right to exist mean then?
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 thought so, well we disagree then. I support a two-state solution and you want to destroy Israel
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 I heard it directly when I visited Ramallah last year
@NuriaCorbi @davidwhite020 are you against the existence of Israel?
@davidwhite020 @NuriaCorbi do u support Hamas forcing Palestinian families to have rocket launchers on their homes to make them targets?
@davidwhite020 @NuriaCorbi blockade exists because of attacks, Egypt enforces it too. If rockets stop peace comes.
@NuriaCorbi just asking because even tho I think Israel over-reacted it's not as black & white as some ppl make out. Need dialogue for peace
@NuriaCorbi in yr view how shd a country respond if over 2000 rockets are fired at it in a year from launchers placed in populated areas?

@Holborncompany  @CllrTony difference is our Labour council will clear it up and look to prosecute, Tories wd pretend it's not there
@NuriaCorbi try reading through my twitter feed
@NuriaCorbi I've criticised Israel too, but that doesn't blind me to Hamas doing wrong
@APFaz I visited Israel and Palestine last yr, most ordinary people I met on both sides are desperate for peace and believe it's achievable
@6echelon that sounds more like being prepared in case. We need dialogue not slaughter.
@NuriaCorbi and I've previously criticised the Israeli Govt too, we need negotiated peace not a resumption of war and killing
@NuriaCorbi what Hamas are doing will result in more deaths. The only solution is through negotiation not killing.
Appalled that Hamas have ended the ceasefire by resuming rocket attacks on Israel. Hope the Israelis will show restraint in their response.
@Eleric33 I think you'll find the Tories have been in charge of immigration for the past four years, and they've failed on their own terms

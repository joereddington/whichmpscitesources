@gdm1927 @LucyMPowell @bbcqt then the chances are you'll get Cameron & Osborne again Thu Mar 12 23:24:54 GMT 2015
@mark4thorne @LucyMPowell @bbcqt you can make sure it's not the case by voting in a majority Labour govt Thu Mar 12 23:23:33 GMT 2015
Again @LucyMPowell makes it crystal clear - if you want the Tories out don't vote SNP or LibDem or Green, vote Labour @bbcqt Thu Mar 12 23:16:06 GMT 2015
@Martin_Hoscik @bbcqt 35 years ago - that's a done deal. Tories were pro Europe and anti-gay then #change Thu Mar 12 23:08:06 GMT 2015

@MarioCreatura do you think Cameron shd take part in a leaders' TV debate with Ed Miliband like he promised in 2010? Mon Mar 09 09:40:29 GMT 2015
@MarioCreatura Labour's going to win a majority, and I suspect Croydon Central will be one of the seats that makes that happen Mon Mar 09 09:39:37 GMT 2015
@MarioCreatura are Govt whips saying ministers & shadow ministers shd not do visits related to their jobs? Govt will be interested Mon Mar 09 09:31:08 GMT 2015

@adrianshort ISIS are fascists. I want the security services finding and stopping their murderous fascist supporters b4 they kill. Tue Mar 03 14:25:31 GMT 2015
@adrianshort of course not, but instead of leaping to blame security services we shd consider the role of extremist ideology not excuse it Tue Mar 03 14:23:35 GMT 2015
@adrianshort you sound like you agree the security services shd just let extremists get on with it. You're wrong. Tue Mar 03 14:14:35 GMT 2015
@SaghirH @suzy4harlow you didn't tho did you? You just sent a snide tweet. Tue Mar 03 14:04:55 GMT 2015

@SaghirH @suzy4harlow there were over 50 illegal encampments recently. Major concerns locally. You'd ignore for PC reasons wd you? Tue Mar 03 13:33:22 GMT 2015
@adrianshort @UK_CAGE I never said they didn't condemn them, I said they excused them. You get the difference, right? Tue Mar 03 13:31:59 GMT 2015
@adrianshort @UK_CAGE they tried to blame the security forces for Emwazi's sickening crimes. Ridiculous excuse-making. Tue Mar 03 13:27:51 GMT 2015

@Canknitwillknit @CroydonLabour @andrewstevensen how does wasting £80m on a school that never opens create more diverse provision? Thu Feb 12 15:04:27 GMT 2015
Good to see #Croydon explaining to residents just how severe Govt cuts are to our community's local services http://t.co/3c2RzaTgpZ Thu Feb 12 11:46:20 GMT 2015
@bieneosa @GavinBarwellMP E&W Croydon stations closer in than many zone4 stations, and link to Croydon regen zone adds further weight Thu Feb 12 09:00:08 GMT 2015

@Greek_Phil same cops that enforce compulsory seat belts. The law change changes attitudes. Don't consign our kids to disease please Wed Feb 11 23:23:12 GMT 2015
@oxjustice because they'd rather get lung disease, right? Wed Feb 11 23:20:58 GMT 2015
@Greek_Phil that's what they said about seatbelts too. Proved wrong. Wed Feb 11 23:20:26 GMT 2015

@TLangworth @GuideToPolitics @leicesterliz agreed, but councils need to give local service users a bigger say at the same time Fri Feb 06 10:10:21 GMT 2015
@RogerLEaster @GavinBarwellMP the Govt's destruction of social care services is one of main reasons hospitals are full to bursting Fri Feb 06 10:07:45 GMT 2015

@Becca_March there's cruelty in all kinds of slaughterhouses that must be ended.  Is there no kitemark for higher standard slaughterhouses? Tue Feb 03 17:47:40 GMT 2015
@severnofnine it didn't follow either Halal rules or the law.  I hope the perpetrators will face court for their barbarity. Tue Feb 03 17:46:15 GMT 2015
Shocked & saddened by latest ISIS outrage burning Jordanian pilot alive.  These warped people disgrace humanity.  Condolences to his family Tue Feb 03 17:44:48 GMT 2015

@nickdc1987 that shd read website not manifesto. Tue Feb 03 10:06:14 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 I do not understand the Green mentality that equates the ANC and anti-fascists with the fascists in ISIS. It's abhorrent Tue Feb 03 10:05:01 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 it's not on the manifesto in any detail either. She doesn't know her own policies is the truth of it. Tue Feb 03 10:02:41 GMT 2015
@moguloilman that'll be why Caroline Lucas distances herself from her local Green-run council. The reality doesn't match the promise. Tue Feb 03 10:01:36 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 yr leader specifically defended supporting ISIS and AlQaeda as a matter of free speech. Altho she's desperately backtracking now Tue Feb 03 09:59:49 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 @afneil do you recall Ms Bennett refuting the figure? Tue Feb 03 09:58:20 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 comparing those fighting fascism in Spain to the fascists in ISIS is a disgraceful slur on their memory Tue Feb 03 09:56:08 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 so your own leader was a mere £100bn out in her understanding of her own key policy? Tue Feb 03 09:55:03 GMT 2015
@nickdc1987 one said it will be fully costed in manifesto the other said it won't. Total disarray. And as for legalising support for ISIS... Tue Feb 03 09:53:23 GMT 2015
Green leader: £280bn citizens income will be fully costed in manifesto. Green MP: citizens income won't be in manifesto. #ludicrous Tue Feb 03 09:50:42 GMT 2015
Greens ditch 2 of their loony policies just days after their leader defended them on TV: citizens income & legalising supporting terrorists Tue Feb 03 09:47:30 GMT 2015

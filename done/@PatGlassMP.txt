@MrCliveC @BrummieGran So how come we have thousands less coppers than 2010? Fri Apr 03 19:34:49 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl @JKDabrowska @Conservatives @SunNation I will! Fri Apr 03 19:33:40 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl yes. I suspect it is The Sun's interpretation of 'zero hrs'. I have had p/t staff but always on fixed hrs every week Fri Apr 03 19:33:12 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl then I need to check with IPSA but they have it wrong. Not the 1st time Fri Apr 03 19:30:43 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl @JKDabrowska @Conservatives @SunNation I don't care where they get their info it is wrong. I wd never pay exploitative wages Fri Apr 03 19:29:56 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl I employ 3 f/t staff; 1f/t apprentice & 1 p/t (retired) on fixed hours 1 day a week. I pay living wage to apprentice Fri Apr 03 19:27:54 BST 2015
We r headed for a teacher shortage. What a surprise. Every Tory govt leaves office with a teacher shortage Fri Apr 03 18:44:57 BST 2015
@WolsinghamEarl THAT IS NOT TRUE! I do not employ anyone on a zero hours contract Fri Apr 03 17:18:00 BST 2015

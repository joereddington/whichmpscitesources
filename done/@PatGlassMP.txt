APPG on Global Education gave excellent presentation on dangers of children without education in conflict & Ebola hit areas

@DavidStockdale my brother was in the audience & said Ed saw her off. Just more anti-Ed media hype
When Labour in power during global crash Cameron blamed Labour's spending Now Cameron warns of another global clash. Who will he blame now?
@Barrie_Hardy you need 2 email
@Bleakworldview You are a star!
@UKIPSwale @HouseofTwits "smears" based on Farage's own words recorded when he thought voters not listening. NHS unsafe with Tories or UKIP

So surprise surprise EU immigrants contribute far more to UK economy than they take out in benefits :UCL study
@bernieforkin @KathyShaw1 Oh yes he did!
Tory Minister John Hayes clearly thinks he's the dame in a 3rd rate pantomime judging by his summing up in local bus debate
Clear that govt stands with bus companies making massive profits & not with ordinary people who need affordable buses
Spoke in HoC about hypocrisy of Tory members voting for massive Council cuts then criticising councils for cutting bus subsidies
Waiting to speak in debate on Local Bus Services or rather lack of them in NW Durham. Govt priorities 50b HS2 -v- £0 on bus services

@btp67 You got it -parents!
@tru These pension pots built up & paid out tax free on basis recipients won't fall back on state Now that very likely. #osborneeconomics
200,000 expected to blow their pension pot next year. Experience elsewhere is these people will fall back on state #osborneeconomics

Watching The Apprentice. I think Lindsey shames the rest of them in her dignity
@appensieve Thanks
@Ed_Miliband spells out 5 more years of crisis from Tories
PM accuses @Ed_Miliband of not answering questions @ PMQs. 4.5 yrs in & don't think Cameron has quite got the hang of this!
@appensieve @NickyMorgan01 Send me the evidence
SoS says she is not ideological but refuses 2 consider parity of funding 4 primary federations even where evidence shows parity of outcomes
SoS giving Educ Select Cmtt lots of nice warm words but very little evidence to support her words
SoS seems to b suggesting new RCs will become new 2nd tier but without the pesky inconvenience of accountability & democratic oversight
@nickymorgan_17 getting into real trouble over academy chains right not to b inspected
Educ Select Cmtt Chair challenges SoS over powers of Chief Inspector to inspect academy chains.
SoS trying 2 argue that school improvement services in LAs shd b inspected by Ofsted but same function in academy chains shd not. Bizarre!
@BeckyFrancis7 @NickyMorgan01 Except the ones with a handful of pupils presumably
@bushbytiger @Start_UK @OsramUK take the point. My mum is registered blind & LEDs need to be supplemented for her

@KyleButcher yes
@KyleButcher Email me. Happy to have dialogue on this
@KyleButcher trickle down economics argument just does not work& £5k per head transport spend in a London -v- £5 per head in NE is immoral
@EricPickles Oh good, so long as there is loads more £s spent on London transport lets not worry that rural areas have few or NO buses
@lucianaberger @DianaJohnsonMP Educ Select Cmtt looked at this very issue this morning. Needs to be statutory
Left Childcare Payments Bill to make sure Educ Select Cmtt is quorate. ran the length of the parliamentary estate to get there in time.

@hocwatch There is a difference between English people having greater control of their lives & little England rhetoric
@trevstanley @KevanJonesMP We will do our level best
@AdrianNCL I didn't reject NE regional authority
Woke up to Owen Patterson, Nigel Farage et al spouting little England rubbish. Didn't take them long to crawl out did it
We begged them to stay. It's now up to us in Labour to show them their faith was justified & turn this into devolution to nations & regions
Cameron tweets that he has rang & congratulated Alistair Darling. How about ringing Gordon
Cannot believe that results not in yet & ANeil is already going for Ed Miliband
Thanks 2 everyone &there were lots of you, who came to help in the Crook by-election. Well worth it. Resounding victory 4 Labour. 17%swing

Just about 2 open my debate Future of Nursery Schools. Out-perform every other sector in EY yet neglected by govt & facing uncertain future
Just saw Christopher Biggins outside Parliament in the most amazing pink suit. He looked fab & taller than I thought

Great result in #bedroomtax vote & humiliating defeat for IDS & Gove.

Nick Raynesford MP pointing out that everything in #bedroomtax PMB was contained in exemptions put forward by Labour when Bill first enacted
#bedroomtax has caused human misery on a huge scale NickRaynesfordMP tells HoC

Andrew George on his feet speaking to 2nd reading of his PMB #bedroomtax

Is Salmond really suggesting that the people of England, NI & Wales can be forced into a currency union against their wishes
Salmond proposing the "Panama" option for Scotland. Does this make Scotland a 3rd world country upon independence
@KirtonJulie Yes he is & a really content baby
Alistair Darling - the whole point of a currency union is that both partners have to agree. Too true & it's not going to happen
@callumrsmith Thank u. He is a lovely boy to add to my 3 gorgeous girls

Cameron telling HoC that more nurses in NHS under the Tories. Not according to head of Royal College of Nurses when he spoke to me yesterday
EDM tells PM he cannot even answer basic questions on NHS
Cameron seriously trying to tell HoC NHS better under Tories
@DavidBlunkettMP giving evidence to Educ Select Cmtt  One of the few political giants
Cameron tells HoC he will build allies in EU following his 26-2 defeat last week. Good luck with that then!
Good question to PM. Given his behaviour last week what will happen when he really needs help in EU
Cameron insisting that a 26-2 defeat in EU & failure 2 build allies is really a sign of principle
Minister agrees to meet with me & Durham CC on Story Homes application to build on greenfield site outside of boundary of Lanchester Village

@Kevin_Maguire my office has been inundated with calls for help getting passports out of Passport Office
@harryph @HouseofTwits  4 times as many on zero contracts as on unemployment register but pretty much amounts to same thing
Charlie Elphick MP on Radio4 criticises Oxfam 4 telling it as it is but 10% population in food poverty every day is wrong in anyone's world
@BBCMarkDenten my office has been inundated with requests for help to help get passports out of passport office
So now Gove is saying Sr Michael Wilshaw is wrong in saying He resisted no notice Ofsteds. Rest of us all completely out of step with Gove
Gove appears to be trying to say DfE knew nothing abt extremism in BHam Govs before TrojanHorse. If true this is sheer incompetence
Extremism Statement:Cameron has put Pickles between May & Gove to stop any fighting in class. Funny if this was not so serious

DfE appearance before Educ Select Cmtt a bit of a train crash & that's looking at it optimistically
Following DfE Board evidence to ESC am seriously worried abt capability on children's services
ESC: 347 voluntary exit packages in 12/13 cost £23m. 33%+ over £50k, 60 over £100k, 14 @ £150k-£200k. Board not clear abt VFM rules on exits
Following DfE Board evidence to ESC I am seriously worried & underwhelmed at level of capability
ESC:Clear that DfE Board has no handle at all on strategy, finance or direction of children's & safeguarding services #traincrash

@killhopelaw @dwpgovuk Agreed. Politicians need 2 b so careful on the language they use. It matters
@killhopelaw These are scary times particularly for the old, the vulnerable, the poor.
@killhopelaw Sometimes constituents think I have some control over Council decisions.  Sometimes I wish I had!
@durhamdj It is one of the biggest spenders of tax payers money & tax payers have a right to say, thru ballot box, how that money is spent
@durhamdj I agree, we were the midwife of lots of this but let's not focus on that, let's work with teachers to get it right from 2015
@mygirlruth incredibly powerful because it is the daily life of teachers

@JeanHaines that's the problem with policy that is not supported by evidence. At best 'hunch & guesswork' @ worst 'pure ideology'
Last time I saw #tonybenn he was standing in the crowd listening to speeches @ Durham Miners Gala. Ever a man of the people
@JeanHaines He fully intends to ignore the democratically elected view of Parliament
@chris_swan thank you Christine. Good to hear from you!
#badgercull vote 219 against cull 1 in favour. The view of Parliament very very clear NO CULL!  Minister refuses 2 accept view of Parliament
@IrrancaDaviesMP gives great summing up in #badgercull debate. Cull is inhumane, inefficient @ gross waste of money
Have had to come out of #badgercull debate as my coughing disturbing speakers. Left b4 thrown out. Will watch on TV
In fairness have to comment that govt members now coming into chamber for #badgercull debate.
In chamber for start of #badgercull debate. Few on govt benches. What a surprise!

Schools Minister giving details of areas that will gain schools funding but refuses 2 give details 2 Labour MPs whose areas will lose out
@NickDakinMP flushes out Laws on funding for 18+ students. Cutting most vulnerable 18+ to redistribute to mainly Tory/Lib-Dem areas
@BillEstersonMP tells Commons City LAs lost heavily from govt cuts already & questions school funding changes that will make this worse
KevinBrennanMP tells Govt they r kidding themselves if they think a national funding formula will not result in some schools losing money
Schools Minister announces new money for schools. Mainly going to Tory & Lib-Dem areas & some crumbs for Labour areas with greatest need
Education select Cmtt taking evidence on child wellbeing. Evidence is UK kids get 2 much materially from their parents & 2 little time

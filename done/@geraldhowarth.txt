There we have it, the UK is no longer master of its own house.  The European Court interferes over UK bankers’ bonuses.
Sir John Major is spot on about immigration.  Perhaps our EU friends will listen to him even if they don’t listen to the current PM
Philip Hammond is right, Nick Clegg is wrong. We shouldn't ring-fence overseas aid spending in law when we are struggling to cut the deficit
Hampshire MPs thank Dame Mary Fagan for her tremendous work as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire over the last 2 decades http://t.co/5JmdO8HCkM
22,000 foreign criminals removed from the UK under this Government - not bad going and a vast improvement on Labour's record
What a nerve by the European Commission!  UK must refuse to pay this surcharge which is a penalty for our economic success.
Lord Green of Migrationwatch - brilliant elevation to the peerage. He's done more than anyone to articulate concern about #immigration
Glad I persuaded McDonalds to retain the building!
Great to see the Tumbledown Dick re-emerging from the scaffolding and cladding to reveal its restored condition.

Excellent news re Frimley Park Hospital's ‘outstanding’ report for service to the local community;  well done to all the staff
Weasel words from #EdMiliband on #Syria. If the threat is so great why doesn’t he just support the PM?
#EdMiliband 'forgets' to mention 2 of UK's biggest issues- immigration (they let in 2.2m) & the budget deficit (they were responsible)
My statement on the outcome of the #indyref http://t.co/8K7uEbwRlf
Major constitutional changes must not be rushed. Appeasing Scottish Nationalism is what brought us to the brink of disaster #Union
PM absolutely right to insist that only English MPs vote on English matters #WestLothianQuestion
Huge relief but no elation that #Scotland voted not to destroy the Union #novote #bettertogether
@GetHampshire My speech also recognised the Gurkhas magnificent contribution to the British Army over nearly 200 yrs http://t.co/qZLQRHkS3j
@GetHampshire Also important to note that the Backbench Business Committee in Parliament decided the title and time for the debate
@GetHampshire The Inquiry is led by my colleague @JackieDP, I spoke to ensure concerns of my constituents were addressed in the debate

#Putin's threat to annex part or all of #Ukraine poses the most serious threat to European security since the Cuban missile crisis
PM commendably robust on Islamic extremism. But the RAF should be contributing to airstrikes to defeat #ISIL's attempt to conquer #Iraq
As I predicted, Russia marches in.What happened to Yeltsin, Clinton and Major's  '94 Budapest Agreement supporting Ukraine's sovereignty?
PM's warning regarding terrorist threat should be taken seriously by us all. Please be vigilant
Devastating report on #Rotherham illustrates the price we've paid for political correctness, driven by the left of British politics
@foreignoffice The Foreign Secretary is absolutely right.  #IS is a real threat to the Middle East and UK and must be defeated
Interesting @DFID_UK infographic on @UKaid humanitarian support to #Iraq http://t.co/YbEJ1sAVb5
UK humanitarian aid is excellent, but risk of IS taking over #Iraq requires British military intervention alongside the US
Solid performance by Alistair Darling @TogetherDarling . Let’s hope that Salmond does not destroy the union #ScotDecides #bettertogether
Sombre but very dignified commemorations of WW1 yesterday. Hopefully we have learnt the lessons

Wise decision to bring the black boxes back to #Farnborough - best accident investigators in the world #MH17
@jonsnowC4 Jon misses the point - we can remove the nominator of Lord Hill;  we are powerless to remove Juncker.
@MatthewBarzun great to know we are so strongly agreed on the importance of the special relationship

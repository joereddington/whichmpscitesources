Great speech by @CarolineFlintMP at our (slightly early) @NPCLabour Xmas dinner. Lovely evening. Thank you Caroline & @PhilColeLabour
PCCs 2nd birthday today. 1 in 8 voted for them & elections cost over £80m. Time to abolish, put savings into frontline & save 1000 officers
16,000 police officers already gone. Thousands more to go under TMay plans. Thin blue line getting thinner & thinner http://t.co/lyjpFe03Iw
In Parliament today to vote for @CliveEfford's Bill to #SaveTheNHS. You can back it too http://t.co/1BPp3cxmmk
This is awful case of domestic violence victim charged bedroom tax on secure panic room @Ed_Miliband raised in #PMQs http://t.co/KaZn6qR5WD
Labour's motion gives Commons vote for European Arrest Warrant & 35 measures that PM promised. T May says Govt will vote for Labour motion
Time for sensible debate on immigration, not politics of division. We won't join Tory/UKIP arms race of rhetoric http://t.co/q8yVIiWtxR
Why Labour will bring in more enforcement & borders staff to prevent illegal immigration, trafficking & exploitation http://t.co/q8yVIiWtxR

@WMLabour thankyou for a great evening! (Though the Thompsons banner makes me look like I am being hugged by a statue!)
Good for @J_Ennis. Sheff United shld realise professional footballers are community role models & take stand against violence against women
Good discussion on immigration at public meeting in #Sherwood earlier with our great candidate @leoniemathers  http://t.co/b1e0HWgRJV
Theresa May is still denying the Commons a vote on EAW, but the Lords will be allowed one. so much for democracy. http://t.co/YG6lJoMwCB…

Been to see beautiful #TowerPoppies glistening in dark. Big crowd still & people talking abt great grandparents who'd fallen #ArmisticeDay
We've proposed HoC votes tomorrow (there's time) on all 35 measures inc European Arrest Warrant. We'll support & puts beyond legal doubt.
Utter chaos in Commons. Speaker confirms this is NOT a vote on the European Arrest Warrant despite PM promises. Why is TMay sitting silent?
Cameron promised "no ifs no buts"  to meet net migration target, its "a promise to the British people." Yet TMay says its only "a comment"
Beautiful #RemembranceSunday services at Normanton & Altofts today - ending with traditional release of pigeons to recognise wartime role

May right (don't often say that) & Gove wrong (often say that); European Arrest Warrant vital against crime & to deport foreign criminals
Lots of people signing our petition in #Pontefract today against local GP cuts. We need more GPs not fewer. http://t.co/4UV1HxwbRB

And called for Govt to rapidly establish overarching inquiry into child abuse, which still has no chair or terms of reference 2 months on
Asked UQ in Commons on abuse in Rotherham. Called for more support for victims, prosecution of criminals, accountability & stronger laws
Utterly confused about what Gov security policy now is #Clegg @BBCr4today. Why did PM make big claims at press conf if nothing's worked out?
But some of other proposals are very vague & unclear how they'd work. And still should do more to strengthen Prevent http://t.co/E1Hpr4hAKG
Glad Gov now agrees TMay was wrong to abolish relocation powers 3yrs ago & will reverse decision. TPIMs arent working http://t.co/E1Hpr4hAKG
PM says new measures but Gov still negotiating what they are hours before statement. Is this how they make security policy? Not good enough

@CasWhiteRose Congratulations!! Good luck! When is the final?
Fact that PM thinks #reshuffle solves his women problem shows how bad his blind spot is: 5 cabinet women up from 4 in 2011 + no equal pay

Home Office Ministers now saying delays even answering questions about the Passport Office..! http://t.co/IT9tj7iikZ via @BuzzFeedUK
TMay said yesterday "its not true that no of staff at Passport Office has gone down." Home Office figs: 4017 staff in 2010 down to 3444 now
"Backlog, what backlog?" Yesterday T May said Passport Office was meeting all targets & there was no backlog. Today PM admits there is.
Ministers claim there is no passport backlog - have they seen this @guardiannews picture http://t.co/2OO2z3tJYF ?
No response from May in HoC again on why letter to Gove stayed on website for 3 days breaching Ministerial Code. 11th time she ducked issue?
Urged Home Sec to get grip of Passport Agency crisis - families missing holidays, forced to pay extra or dash to Durham to get documents
Astonishing complacency from T May in HoC about Passport Agency crisis. Claimed all targets met, no staff cut & all problems under control!
Did the Home Secretary authorise the "improper release of correspondence between Ministers" that the No 10 statement refers to?
Gove apology & May Spad resignation still miss the point - failure to investigate schools & to work together  w communities on extremism

Oh no. Too much time disagreeing here. We left it too late to ring up & vote. How could we not vote? #GOTVfail The shame of it. #eurovision
After far too much thought, am giving Austria 12 Iceland 10 Greece 9 Denmark 8 Malta 7 (was there a reason why no one gets 11?) #eurovision
Malta does cast of Once - not what I expected #eurovision
Ah thank goodness, normal order restored. #eurovision. Thanks France
Halfway through. What's happened to #eurovision? Am marking much higher than normal. Sweden v gd. But Austria wins. Iceland 2nd
Disputes here over whether we are marking out of 10, 12 or 20 @eurovision

Plan to close #Kellingley is grim news for hundreds of local miners & our communities. Govt must do more http://t.co/ExNZ953bhc
My speech today on progressive approach to immigration http://t.co/tNirUMkUsY - different from conservative & liberal free market views
Expecting Govt statement on #Kellingley thurs. Fearful it means pit closure by 2015 & loss of 800 local jobs. Urging Govt to do more to help
Another Cameron (mini) reshuffle, & result is even fewer women in full Cabinet positions. What is David Cameron's problem with women?
@lidad66 @Stevie5tapes Yorkshire Labour MPs met NUM today to support campaign to keep pits open. UK shouldnt turn its back on deep mine coal

Met with NUM & manager at #Kellingley today to discuss what could be done to keep pit open. Hundreds of jobs at stake http://t.co/By72qpMQZI
V troubled Govt seems to have decided #Kellingley must close by 2015, ruling out other options. We need to keep fighting for jobs & future
Home Office deportations guidance says let teens finish exams & keep families together. Shld be common sense #Yashika http://t.co/fnEyztS479
Deeply worried about jobs at #Kellingley tonight. We must not give up on Britain's last pits - Govt must step in to help
Kellingley Colliery is really important for local jobs & mixed energy supply. That's why Gov needs to work with UK Coal to keep pits open
Link here to my UQ after sad death at Yarl's Wood. Inc need for investigation & wider joint inquiry into operations http://t.co/KpcFQtR0GT

Roundtable on #VAWG organised by @HelenJonesMP today heard worrying evidence about support for victims being wrecked. What is T May doing?
Reviewer's evidence shows T May badly weakened counter-terror powers, pushing up costs & letting 2 suspects run off http://t.co/NWU1Jyipav
Govt response on #dv isn't good enough. Prosecutions down 13% since election. Need national standards not just panel http://t.co/CGbNqShqt1

Pleased to be supporting Parliamentary screening of #1billionrising film today. Should be a great event with lots of inspiring women
Hmm. Not just Gov front bench at #PMQs that has no women. The Cabinet's key Coalition Committee is 12 men & no women http://t.co/3WMzl24D51
Welcome Gov help for women victims of sexual violence in #syria - those vulnerable & still at risk of serious abuse need specialist help
Govt is setting up separate UK programme from UN for #syria refugees - but so similar its really unclear why they want it separate
Debating #syria refugees in Parliament. Right that Gov has reversed its position, torture victims & most vulnerable refugees need sanctuary
Thankyou to @UNHCRUK @AmnestyUK @savethechildren @refugeecouncil crossparty MPs & thousands who signed petition to get PM to change his mind
Labour debate on #syria refugees will go ahead tomorrow, but hope w cross party agreement now Gov has bowed to pressure & reversed position

Cross party support in Lords for helping vulnerable Syrian refugees; http://t.co/JGfXmuKXtP Why are David Cameron & Theresa May so opposed?
18 other countries have signed up to help. My article in tomorrow's @Independent on why Britain should too; http://t.co/tYs9AXqsUn #Syria
PM in Davos resisting taking vulnerable Syrian refugees because "it won't solve the crisis." Of course it won't, but it cld save some lives
Help us prevent #domesticviolence in next generation. Support compulsory sex&relationship education http://t.co/TrfswRuYh7 Lords vote #28Jan
House of Lords votes on compulsory sex&relationship education on #28jan. Show your support by signing petition http://t.co/TrfswRuYh7
Labour party, Tory/Lib Dem backbenchers, & now even DPM says he supports UN programme for vulnerable refugees. Why is Theresa May resisting?
Time for PM to change his mind & agree to help vulnerable Syrian refugees. Shouldn't turn our backs on torture victims & abandoned children
Met @twitter in the autumn & urged faster, stronger action against hate crime. Progress still too slow. They must get their act together
Strong call for UK to join UN programme for the most vulnerable Syrian refugees by @Ed_Miliband at #PMQs. Why is PM so opposed?
Pressed Home Sec on whether the 6 terror suspects released from restrictions this week are still a risk to the public. She refuses to say
Debate about to start on Govt removing restrictions on terror suspects http://t.co/dmtP1QegAX. Theresa May must provide answers
Shame TMay didn't do UQ today & hear strong cross party support for UK joining UN programme for Syrian torture victims & vulnerable children
Poor response from Minister. UK right to provide significant aid but why refuse UN call to help most vulnerable refugees? It's not either/or
Urgent question on Syrian refugees at 3.30pm. Other countries helping UN programme for most vulnerable refugees, but so far UK has refused
.@HarrietHarman right that Clegg is letting down women who spoke out & sending wrong signal on workplace harassment
http://t.co/LUlcwBv0v3
Clegg keeps saying case is about women in "distress". But it's really about whether there is respect for women at top of political party 2/2
Disappointing Nick Clegg interview on @BBCr4today. Problem is not just lack of leadership but wider attitude towards women ...1/2
Other countries doing their bit to help Syria's most vulnerable refugees. UK must not turn its back @independent http://t.co/tWqzwmKkuS

@EuroSue That's exactly what we're campaigning for - and more Lords debates likely on this before the end of this month
PM agreed today that sex&relationship education guidance should be updated. But Gove still opposed. And why won't they make it compulsory?
Shameful that Tories & LibDems in Lords voted against stronger gun control in #domesticviolence cases. Lost amendment 86D by 55 votes

Why we need compulsory sex&relationship education to stop violence against women & abuse in relationships http://t.co/DqtzhZ3bfP @OBRUK_1
Stronger protection needed against domestic abuse too. See blog by @DanJarvisMP on #eveslaw http://t.co/Pv3ntsY6GH @EveThomas40 @OBRUK_1
@IfBChristine sadly Tories blocked it before election - Michael Gove the most vociferous opponent
Children's Commissioner says rising violence in teen relationships; why we need compulsory SRE inc zero tolerance of violence @OBRUK_1

Paul Goggins' work as a Minister on double jeopardy legislation was immensely important - made convictions possible in Stephen Lawrence case

Thoughts with Lee Rigby's family, friends & colleagues as his murderers found guilty. A vile, brutal attack that we will not let divide us
No 10 confirmation that any plan for EU migration cap would only cover new countries shows May & Clegg are in deliberate phoney war today
Read this blog by @dianajohnsonmp to see why we need stronger protection for victims in the Slavery Bill http://t.co/Urmgx7Zjtd
Modern Slavery Bill doesn't go far enough. We need protection for trafficked children. Add your name here to support: http://t.co/6sRMfR0Pw6
On @BBCr4today I've called for protection of child victims to be added to Modern Slavery Bill. Rescued children are too often enslaved again
Modern Slavery Bill due to be published tomorrow. Important that it includes protection for child victims http://t.co/PEQ5LcmIVJ
2/3 of children rescued from trafficking  go missing again. Law must change to protect child victims http://t.co/SJstZo7CpM @guardian

Across the world people are remembering where they were when he walked free (A cold student basement - dancing, crying & cheering at telly)
He was an inspiration for the world, not just for a nation. So very sad that Nelson Mandela has died.
HoC Library shows Clegg wrong on personal allowance too; less is paid to women http://t.co/rtPjb5lzcY & women lose more overall @LucyMPowell
Nick Clegg ducked q from @LucyMPowell today re marriage tax break being paid mainly to men. Commons library research shows 80% paid to men
Just paid tribute on @BBCLeeds Drive to bravery of police officer who was shot, swift work of West Yorks Police & calm response of community
Thoughts & best wishes with police officer shot in Leeds for speedy recovery & all at WYP. Shows risks police take each day to keep us safe

Lords vote tonight on Labour #gunsafety amendment to stop people w history of domestic abuse from owning guns #56MD Will Govt support us?
Asked Home Sec why rape prosecutions down & police referring 33% fewer cases to court since 2010, even though reported rapes up. No answer
Leaked figs show rising property crime @timescrime http://t.co/YIY82bnSpU Yet Home Sec in Commons today extremely complacent on crime
Thoughts this morning with all those involved in the awful tragedy in Glasgow - and their families too

Clear from T May that policies won't be in place by 1 Jan. And Gov not tackling exploitation of immigration eg closing minimum wage loophole

@indiaknight Wonderful woman! Read Tiger so often I can remember most of the words; "once there was a little girl called sophie..."

The more reports emerge on the Lambeth case the more dreadful & distressing it seems to be. Vital that the victims get proper support & help
Serious wake up call here to Theresa May & Damian Green who have been so complacent on recorded crime figures http://t.co/SO2jPKTAIJ
Enjoyed @TeleWonderWomen debate this evening with @Emmabarnett @drwollastonmp @lucymanning & @JenniferGarrett. More women in politics needed
3 crimes where reported cases up but referrals to CPS down (rape, DV, child abuse). Specialist police units vital but hit hard by Govt cuts
Worrying pattern here; child abuse referrals to CPS down 28%, DV referrals down 13%, rape referrals down 33%. All 3 reported crimes are up
Google action on child abuse welcome. But Govt must act too. Shocking that child abuse cases referred to CPS down 28% http://t.co/0dFVobirjP

This Home Sec abolished power to relocate serious terror suspects - so Magag & Mohamed were returned to London making it easier to run off
Two out of ten serious terror suspects under Theresa May's TPIMs have disappeared. In previous 5 yrs under stronger powers no one absconded

So much for bout of autumn domesticity & jam making! Kitchen full of mashed garden berries, spilt sugar, feels like midnight, & still no set
@GillCraigie haven't patience to wait for shops to reopen, will have to wreck a recipe instead
@K_Hilly that would require going out again! Think it will just have to be bitter chutney

Everyone else could see how ineffective & divisive the Ad Vans were. Theresa May agreed to them & defended them. She should be ashamed.

Great that nearly half Labour Shadow Cabinet are women - proportion increased to 44% http://t.co/AITVBnv703
After 3.5 yrs & another reshuffle will it still be only 4 women out of 22 in Cameron/ Clegg cabinet? No wonder Govt is failing women
Cameron & Clegg #reshuffle yet looks like not a single extra woman will make it into cabinet? Surely this isn't serious?
Finally Op Alice files w CPS. Vital to get to truth given serious implications for police, Downing St & Mitchell. Already taken far too long
Every time I go thru Kings Cross I wonder why there are so few clocks (yes, nearly missed train again). Needs a giant one like at Waterloo.
Dreadful that Quentin Letts chose to repeat & not apologise for smears @bbcquestiontime. Worth watching audience & @mehdirhasan responses

For this PM, most people's love & commitment doesn't count. My @politicshome article on married couples allowance http://t.co/g9L3WFtO9q
"Love is love.." Married Couples Allowance payments mainly go to men. No wonder David Cameron wouldn't use the word "feminist" @RedMagsDaily
"Love is love. Commitment is commitment...." for married couple with one earner on £40k, but not for married couple with each on £10k
"Love is love. Commitment is commitment..." for those on their 2nd/3rd wives but not for the ex they left behind holding the baby
"Love is love, commitment is commitment," says PM. Except for 2/3 married couples, widows, single parents... #wontgetmarriedcouplesallowance
@RedMagDaily @Ed_Miliband Definitely. Ed talked about importance of new feminism in speech on Sat at Labour Women's Conference
Oh dear. Seems David Cameron is scared of the f-word http://t.co/ymelO1CVGp @RedMagDaily #feminism

No answer from Minister to these qs in Commons - & no answer on why Theresa May wouldn't come to Commons on this critical NAO report
NAO says Calais freight & stowaway checks stopped 21 times in 3 days due to understaffing/pressures. How often were checks stopped last yr?
Will Gov publish internal audit report on border control which NAO says confirms "resourcing... has had an impact on security of border"?

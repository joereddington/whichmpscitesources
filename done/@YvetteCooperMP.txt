David Cameron & Theresa May must reverse their opposition to EU search & rescue today. Cannot turn our backs on people who are drowning Thu Apr 23 12:30:51 BST 2015
Troubled by report that EU summit today won't bring back search&rescue even tho so many are drowning off European shores #RestartTheRescue Thu Apr 23 12:27:45 BST 2015
Tories extreme cuts mean deeper cuts to policing in next few yrs than the last. Labour plan protects 10k police from Tory cuts in next 3yrs Thu Apr 23 12:14:20 BST 2015
Reports of violent crime up 21%, sex offences up 32%, rape up 
40%. Yet prosecutions for violence, rape, child abuse are all down Thu Apr 23 12:11:14 BST 2015
1st rise in recorded crime in 10yrs shows shocking complacency of Tories&why we must stop Tory plan for even deeper police cuts in next 3yrs Thu Apr 23 11:27:50 BST 2015
Nick Clegg proposal for EU review of search & rescue really isn't enough. EU must agree at summit tomorrow to urgently #RestartTheRescue Wed Apr 22 17:23:57 BST 2015

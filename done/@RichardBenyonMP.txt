Really excellent speeches from Prime Minister and Leader of Opposition. Parliament at its best
An overused adjective but 'electric' describes atmosphere in House as PM speaks
In Parliament for debate on response to ISIL. Hope to get chance to speak and explain why I will be supporting Government motion

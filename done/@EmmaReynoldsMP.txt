Here's hoping today's vote marks beginning of the end for the bedroom tax but we need a Labour government in 2015 to make sure its scrapped.
Voting now to reduce number of ppl who pay #bedroomtax but only a Labour government in 2015 can scrap it. It's cruel, unjust & isn't working

.@ChrisLeslieMP & I are in Kent today to outline Labour's Help to Build proposal to boost small builders http://t.co/6rYxofF4ps
Tories' New Homes Bonus redistributes money from poorer councils to richer ones, & isn't delivering the homes we need http://t.co/fAa42avXDK
FT here http://t.co/aRaaT56qBb show govt failing on housing. New Homes Bonus isn't working. It's redistributing  from poorer areas to richer

This govt presides over the lowest level of house building since 1920s, but starts projected to fall 4% nxt year. http://t.co/FqpaMaKuEE
Govt's leaked report reveals full extent of their failure to solve the housing crisis. Housing starts down 4%. http://t.co/FqpaMaKuEE
Cameron says at #pmqs housing starts are up, leaked document from DCLG says exactly the opposite #ukhousing http://t.co/gO4WNMXZ6h
Govt failure on house building laid bare wt DCLG document apparently confirming a fall in housing starts #ukhousing
I am horribly upset, saddened and shocked to hear about the sudden death of my friend and colleague Bob Jones. I will miss him greatly.
Asked @khopkinsmp why affordable homes built last year is lowest for 5 yrs & new social homes is at a 20 yr low. No answer. Tory failure
In 2009 during the global financial crisis, Labour built 4 times as many social homes as Govt did last year. Tories cant deliver on housing.

Disappointed that Tory & Lib Dem MPs failed to support our motion to introduce longer term tenancies & scrap rip-off fees. #generationrent
Today Labour will propose scrapping rip-off letting fees & guaranteeing 3 year tenancies for tenants #generationrent http://t.co/skUN1kw7bG
Govt is failing #generationrent by refusing to back our plans for longer term tenancies & ban rip-off letting agent fees on tenants
Today Labour will call for scrapping rip off letting fees & to guarantee 3 year tenancies for tenants #generationrent http://t.co/pVuIxborPV
Tomorrow MPs have chance to debate #PRS. Labour want to end instability & ban rip off fees on renters, but will govt listen? #generationrent
Shocking @khopkinsmp thinks evicting ppl on housing benefit is ok. Growth in housing benefit is from ppl in wrk struggling to make ends meet
Since 2010 gap btwn the homes we need & the homes this govt has built is up by over 500,000. Equiv to a city the size of Birmingham

On @daily_politics shortly to discuss Cameron's failure to tackle the housing crisis. Labour would act to build the homes our country needs.
@LettingNetwork fantastic to hear such good practice. Thanks for getting in touch.
Yesterday, Tory & Lib Dem MPs blocked Labour's proposals to #endlettingfees for renters. #generationrent. Only Labour will end unfair fees.
@richj61 lots of good landlords out there and many support our proposals to ban fees on tenants
Many landlords support end to letting agent fees on tenants, they know letting agents work for them http://t.co/Txou9h5DaQ #lettingfees
@FBF25T @BigRedTone that has not happened in Scotland, look at the evidence please.
Experience in Scotland shows that ban on letting agent fees on tenants has had no discernible impact on rents #LettingAgentFees #lettingfees
@DobbinT @BigRedTone the tenant has absolutely no choice of letting agency if they like a property and no negotiating power wt letting agent
@BigRedTone exactly right the tenant chooses a property not a letting agent. Landlord has bargaining power with agent, tenant doesn't.
See my blog for @LabourList on why tenants need a fairer deal by ending unfair letting agent fees #generationrent http://t.co/2r1zkIMMta
If you buy a house you don’t pay estate agent. Seller pays as it's a service for seller. Why are tenants charged? Agents work for landlords.
Across country private renters are paying unfair fees to letting agents. Govt proposals wont change this. We need a ban on fees on tenants.

In Ipswich yday with Labour candidate @davidellesmere at new council houses built by Labour council #labourdoorstep http://t.co/GnpVMbLRXd
Only a #Labour govt would bring housing benefit under control by building more homes and making work pay. @RachelReevesMP #ukhousing
Only a Labour government would take action to bring housing benefit under control http://t.co/SpkCziAjTx
Far from getting housing benefit bill under control, under this govt a near 60% increase of claimants in work - costing an extra 5bn
.@RachelReevesMP & I reveal shocking figures today. Near 60% increase of working people claiming housing benefit under this Govt.
@Adam_Hosker @LandlordRef the client of the letting agents is the landlord not the tenant so the tenant should not have to pay.
@IciLondres @lemondefr thanks Eric great to see you in Glasgow! Amities, Emma
@paulhirschfield i have answered your question, they can ask for one and get one
@paulhirschfield they can ask for one but default is 3 years. I have answered that same question on twitter a number of times!
I've written to @David_Cameron calling on him to say whether he backs Labour's plans for longer term tenancies http://t.co/vEzaWMTJsB …
.@EricPickles @khopkinsmp @BrandonLewis @swilliamsmp will you now listen to Commons & make it compulsory for landlords to fit smoke alarms?
By 245 votes to 8, House of Commons calls on Govt to give private tenants security of a smoke alarm. Labour MPs support. Govt should listen.
.@PhilipDaviesMP thinks tenants in privately rented property don't deserve security of smoke alarm but landlord organisations support alarms
Appalling speech by Tory MP @PhilipDaviesMP against common sense proposal by #Labour MP Nick Raynsford to make smoke alarms mandatory in PRS
.@PhilipDaviesMP thinks tenants in privately rented property don't deserve security of smoke alarm but landlord organisations support this
PM needed to answer question why should 9m renters incl families with children not have more stability. He has no answer at all #pmqs
We are NOT proposing 1970s rent control but 3 year tenancies with a ceiling on rent increases #pmqs #generationrent only Labour will do this
.@David_Cameron should be ashamed. He has abandoned 9m people renting privately. #pmqs #generationrent
@mrdavidwinn we will let local authorities increase council tax on empty homes, make it easier for them to identify accurately empty homes
@mrdavidwinn which directive is this?
Fantastic turnout for #Vaisakhi mela in West Park #Wolverhampton . Great day, great event in celebration of most important Sikh festival
@BrianBeaten @UKLabour @RachelReevesMP They can do so by giving notice to the landlord before end of 3 year tenancy.
Fantastic visit to Milton Keynes yesterday and great response on doorstep wt @andrew4mk #labourdoorstep  http://t.co/6NNLYiqeea
In Milton Keynes earlier talking to voters with Labour candidate @andrew4mk Great response on the doorstep. http://t.co/6NNLYiqeea
@BillEstersonMP Claro mi amigo. Tories all over the place as usual!
@cjfaraway we will establish a ceiling for rent increases (if any) such as inflation or average market rents.
@Londonrab you would have the option but 3 year would be default and norm.
Brandon Lewis unaware his boss Pickles promised long term tenancies wt rents index linked to inflation @Channel4 https://t.co/8F5U37uOPK
@khopkinsmp Your govt has delivered nothing for 9 million private renters despite Pickles promising long term tenancies.
Eric Pickles promised family friendly long term tenancies but govt has delivered nothing for 9m private renters https://t.co/8F5U37uOPK
In Oct 2013 Eric Pickles proposed long term tenancies & index related rent reviews - Brandon Lewis seemed unaware! https://t.co/8F5U37uOPK
Eric Pickles backs stability for renters & transparent service by lettings agents: http://t.co/KHp2AM6erD but does nothing, Labour will act.
On @Channel4News shortly to discuss Labour's plans for longer term tenancies to help families & young ppl renting across the UK #forthemany
Does @grantshapps think @JakeBerryMP supports "Venezuelan style rent control"? Jake Berry backs 6 year tenancies: http://t.co/nq0pGSTBnR
Jake Berry PM's housing advisor backs "longer tenancies, fixed rent reviews and break dates for tenants” http://t.co/nq0pGSTBnR
Talking to #BBC #5live Drive about how Labour will end lettings agents fees for tenants & give renters the stability they want. #ukhousing
@MumsnetBloggers that would be great emma dot reynolds dot mp @ parliament dot uk
On @LBC @JuliaHB1 now to discuss how Labour's longer term tenancies will help families & young ppl renting in #london #FortheMany
@harryph I am not in favour of 1970s style rent controls and that is NOT what we are proposing. We want predictable rent increases.
According to VOA Private Rental Market Statistics, rent increased by 4.8% in London p.a. while Govt is denying rent increases are a problem
on #BBC Radio4 #WATO with @Marthakearney shortly to talk about Labour's plans to reform private rented sector #generationrent #forthemany
We are proposing predictable rents so that tenants and landlords can plan & have certainty. The market will set rent at start of tenancy.
Tories have abandoned #generationrent, they say ppl who rent deserve stability  but they refuse to do anything serious to make it happen
This govt said it backed longer tenancies& rent review clauses indexed to inflation giving tenants grtr stability, http://t.co/KHp2AM6erD
@StevenCarringto that has not happened in Ireland or other countries where there are longer tenancies.
@DavidWinsper read the proposals this is not rent control as landlord and tenant negotiate rent level at start of tenancy
@mokumz we are talking about people renting from private landlords and mind your language
We need more stability for tenants and landlords. Labour will introduce a fairer deal for both, @Ed_Miliband will set out reforms today.
Half of those renting from private landlords are over 35 & a third are families with children. #Labour will introduce stable 3 yr tenancies.
A third of renters are families with children. That's why @UKLabour govt will deliver 3 year tenancies with a ceiling on rent increases.
Germany has stable long term tenancies, a thriving private rented sector which is 60% of market and attracts institutional investment.
France, Spain, Germany, Ireland, New York - all have long term tenancies with predictable rents. It works. @UKLabour govt will deliver it.
@ASI Germany has stable long term tenancies, a thriving private rented sector which is 60% of market and attracts institutional investment.
@ASI then why does it work in Ireland, Germany, France, Spain, New York. Need I go on. Perhaps you should research this!
Ireland recently introduced longer term tenancies with predictable rent increases and private rented sector has grown not shrunk.
@LandlordXX @CllrButt that has NOT happened in Ireland where they introduced these policies and private rented sector has grown.
Labour leader @Ed_Miliband will set out plans tomorrow to ban rip-off letting agency fees on tenants & deliver stable 3 year tenancies.
@PippaCrerar you are absolutely right, the many decent landlords out there have nothing to worry about at all!
A third of renters are families with children. That's why #Labour govt will deliver 3 year tenancies with a ceiling on rent increases.
Half of those renting from private landlords are over 35 & a third are families with children. That's we need stable, long term tenancies.
@jameschappers Adam Smith Institute claims are ridiculous. Longer tenancies with predictable rents are the norm in many different countries.
A #Labour govt will deliver fairer deal for tenants and landlords with 3 year tenancies becoming the norm and banning fees on tenants
Great to be out in Crawley earlier today speaking to voters with @crawleylabour and@chrisoxlade on #labourdoorstep

Tory MP on @bbcwm says housing benefit bill coming down but it is actually going up. He should get his facts right
Good to speak to Adrian Goldberg on @bbcwm about unfair bedroom tax, two thirds affected are disabled, #Labour will scrap it @radriansqtp
On #BBC WM in a couple of minutes to talk about the bedroom tax & why it is a government policy that is failing and needs to be scrapped

Hollow promises from Osborne on house building. Truth is lowest level of houses built in peacetime since 1920s under this govt #Budget2014
Osborne's promises to increase house building sound hollow after 4 yrs of doing next to nothing on boosting supply #Budget2014 #ukhousing
Osborne re-announces new garden city of 15,000 homes in Ebbsfleet - 5,000 fewer homes than govt promised in 2012 #Budget2014
My NS blog - after 4 years of hollow promises, Osborne's promise of a Garden City is too little, too late #ukhousing http://t.co/9yQ8XqYdzZ
Osborne's housing plans are too little too late, 4 years of hollow promises - read my New Statesman blog http://t.co/9yQ8XqYdzZ #ukhousing

@pauluppalmp did you really think that the Council spent 70,000 pounds sterling on a hotel in India? You need a currency converter!
@Bennyboyf @patmcfaddenmp to attract vital investment. Same reason Paul Uppal and David Cameron went on a trade mission to India.
@jennywrens @bbcwm @ExpressandStar to attract vital investment. Same reason Paul Uppal and David Cameron went on a trade mission to India.
@pauluppalmp you should apologise for misleading people Paul and get your facts right
@WolvesCouncil @APhotay Tory Councillors and the Tory #Wolverhampton MP would stop using bogus figures about Wolverhampton Council spending
@jennywrens @WolvesCouncil @APhotay I have not used false or misleading figures therefore I do not need correcting!
It beggars belief that Paul Uppal fails to take into account exchange rate! #Wolverhampton @bbcwm @ExpressandStar @patmcfaddenmp
#Wolverhampton Council have to make £123 million of cuts due to central Government 50% cut to their grant. @patmcfaddenmp is right @bbcwm
Paul Uppal blames #Wolverhampton council for cuts, says they spent £1,400 on pizza in India but actually they are rupees not pounds! @bbcwm

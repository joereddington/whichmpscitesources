No. Still not budged @VirginTrains
Ok. So @VirginTrains say can now proceed to Crewe but train not budged. Is we or isn't we?

Good and bad news: MK then Crewe, missing Stoke-on-Trent. Must be what #HS2 will be like.... @VirginTrains
@VirginTrains PLEASE release the heavily delayed 1600 to Manchester; they're ringing control room but can't get thro as so busy!
@VirginTrains heard my prayer and reinstated the 4pm'ish train to Manchester!
Train mgr just announced no trains leaving euston for foreseeable  @VirginTrains Always makes me wonder how other countries cope

@JayneyTatts I'm not sure what statement you're referring to - my press release refers to mental health need and disease burden
@JayneyTatts we have the 6th highest disease burden, highest of the core cities, it's not incorrect

@JayneyTatts it's a technical term - if you google it you will see it's used by the World Health Organisation
@JayneyTatts the term used is the disease burden
Good luck for the swim leg @andyburnhammp @TriLiverpool @BritTri #Triliverpool http://t.co/uZtqoGl5cG

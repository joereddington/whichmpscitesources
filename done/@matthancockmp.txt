Labour's problem is not the media, but is Labour people complaining about Miliband reported in the media
.@HarrietHarman Yes, that's what we're doing, like for the 1.7m people who have a job now but didn't when Labour left office
Speaking to @JuliaHB1 on @lbc now, on how Ed Miliband doesn't have an economic plan and it's hardworking families who would pay the price.
Errm, Labour did nothing about tax avoidance by the richest for 13 years – some bankers paid less tax than their cleaners. We're tackling it
Ahem, Unite the union use zero hours contracts & paid zero corporation tax last year. By contrast we're banning abusive zero-hours contracts
Miliband relaunches again. But because he doesn't have an economic plan to secure Britain’s future, Ed Miliband will never be up to the job

Wow. Now @ChukaUmunna says it's "bad faith" to give English MPs power over English-only laws. Labour digging a huge hole. #trustthepeople

On Oct 1 we're putting min wage up by 3%, fastest since Great Recession. Only possible because of growth. Labour wld put that growth at risk
@pollytoynbee Polly, there was no double dip. Just the long work of recovering from the Great Recession. Worth checking the latest data
Our tax cuts for the low paid have halved the tax bill for someone on Min Wage. Labour's tax & spend policies would put that at risk

Good to see further manufacturing growth figures - showing a 0.3% rise on the month. Still a long way to go & more to do
With proposals like today's from @ChukaUmunna there's no wonder every Labour Government leaves office with unemployment higher #jobs

Good news: West Suffolk unemployment has dropped by 45% over the last year - to 818. Just 210 young people are unemployed, more than halved
Particularly welcome the biggest fall in youth unemployment on record - the long term plan is spreading opportunity amount young people

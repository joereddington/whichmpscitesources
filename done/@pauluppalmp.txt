My latest article on Tilbury Sikhs http://t.co/6Sp0utiWSc
Further to a letter to the Home Secretary, I today met with her to discuss the 35 Sikh asylum seekers who were discovered at Tilbury Docks.
It is crucial that the clause remains so that employment opportunities available to others are available to Turban wearing Sikhs.
Initial reading of Labour’s amendment suggested they wished to remove hard hat exemptions for Sikhs who wear the Turban.
The amendment “will be withdrawn at the end of the discussion and we [Labour] will not vote on the amendment.”
Glad that after my letter to the Shadow Equalities Minister in the Lords, they will not now seek to remove workplace protections for Sikhs.

@LeeStanleyWV I have been busy working on something and will have an anouncement Monday.
@NancyGiblets @colinross1975 am I expected to question every piece of data? Dangerous position if we cannot trust Council figures.
Thanks @colinross1975 some common sense at last.
.@PSbook As has been covered, I was merely stating figures published by the Council. We have to be confident these are correct.
.@PSbook my earlier tweets/photo show the Council published the figures in £. They have thanked me for pointing this error out.
.@PSbook if you had done your homework you would have seen this was an error on the part of the Council. Please amend your article.
This is not sloppy research as R Lawrence puts it, but a failing on the part of the council to realise that these figures were incorrect.
For anyone listening here is the proof that WV council published incorrect figures. http://t.co/qXnqE3UBLK
@CllrIanAngus It was the council that messed up. Raises questions over the reliability of the spending data that it makes public.
@CllrIanAngus Your concern should be directed at the Council. If they cannot publish spending correctly what else is going wrong?
If there is one thing that #pizzagate has taught us is the need to scrutinise public spending and justify every pound.
@EmmaReynoldsMP I have nothing to apologise for. It was the council that got the figures wrong; they have thanked me for pointing it out.
@ExpressandStar @WolvesCouncil have admitted they were wrong and will put this right, please rephrase headline!
@WolvesCouncil you link to the site as your commitment to be open and transparent with residents. Surely you should make sure it is right?
@WolvesCouncil @wainwright_star How many other errors are you aware of? Does this happen every time spending occurs abroad?
@WolvesCouncil @wainwright_star you have not explained why the public data was wrong? Will you be reviewing data to make sure it is right?
@WolvesSELabour We need to restore confidence in the council that data published is correct. How can we hold them to account if not?
@WolvesSELabour the debate has moved on, @WolvesCouncil admit it was their mistake. They published the incorrect figures.
@wainwright_star Again this was published in pounds, @WolvesCouncil need to urgently review all their published spending data.
@wainwright_star here is the proof it was listed as pounds. How can we trust anything else that is published? http://t.co/qXnqE3UBLK
Are @WolvesCouncil saying that the spend for the Westin Hotel in Pune at £69819 is incorrect too? This seems a lot for a hotel?
How can we trust any data that comes out of @WolvesCouncil on spending?
Did @WolvesCouncil supply the data, you promote the website, why was this wrong?
Will @EmmaReynoldsMP apologise for misleading people over pounds/rupees? Unbelievable that much money was spent.
@EmmaReynoldsMP @bbcwm @ExpressandStar @patmcfaddenmp. Here is the proof it is in pounds and not rupees. http://t.co/Wlln0CqLoB
@EmmaReynoldsMP @bbcwm That is completely wrong, @WolvesCouncil spent £1428 at a Pizza Hut, this is not in rupees.

@tom_watson No, I know as much as you.
It is important that we address what went on, what advice was given and how this differed from the final strategy of the Indian Government.
As a government we have taken decisive action to investigate the questions raised in the disclosure of the documents. #Amritsar
Just been on the BBC to discuss the statement this afternoon on #Amritsar
I will be on the BBC tomorrow talking about #Amritsar ahead of a possible statement.
@PennLabour @ruskyboy I ran a campaign in 2012 to get restrictions. If they are still a problem I will look into it.
As the law stands turban-wearing Sikhs in other  industries face disciplinary action or dismissal for refusing to wear head protection.
As the law currently stands, turban-wearing Sikhs are exempt from wearing head protection the construction industry. This will be expanded.
A quirk in the law that compels the UK’s 750,000 Sikhs to remove their turbans and put on hardhats in certain working environments.
Pleased that the Government will seek to extend the exemption for the Sikh Turban to all workplaces.
@PennLabour It is the interest on the debt which is the real issue, as this affects day to day expenditure.
@PennLabour At 31 March 2013, its total borrowing stood at £519.0M, of which £415.2M is owed to the PWLB and £103.8M to private lenders.
@CYT_Wolves Would it be possible to come along and watch one of your rehearsals? #SaveCYT
. @CYT_Wolves The Leader of the House in his response said council's should never take the easy route out and look to support services.
This morning I raised the campaign to save @CYT_Wolves using the time we have with the deferal to stress the importance of voluntary groups
@CYT_Wolves this morning I raised the closure in the HoC will post question shortly. #SaveCYT
@ExpressandStar @WolvesCouncil must have listened to great organisations like @CYT_Wolves.
@centralbaths Most importantly it is essential that I meet with users of foodbanks. There is a need to discuss why people need food banks.
@centralbaths I visited The Well and volunteered at The Good Shepherd last week. I helped make up food parcels and met with volunteers.
@centralbaths @WolvesCouncil have shareholdings to the value of £18.6M in Birmingham International Airport. Don't know what the dividend is.
@centralbaths Great spot, support the call to use the money to protect leisure services. Will find out how much Wolverhampton's share is.
@RebeccaHarrisMP suggests that young people are finding it easier to enter employment after leaving training or education. #ShareTheFacts
@RebeccaHarrisMP Great news, young people are getting the skills they need for a modern economy. #job2014
@tyrewulf That is just interest on debt, does not include pension liabilities. I will check that statistic. Thanks
@PennLabour @LeeStanleyWV What households need to realise is that £250 of their council tax doesn’t deliver services, it pays off debt.
@PennLabour It is not per annum, it is from 2010/11 to 2015/16.
@PennLabour How much of council tax doesn’t deliver services but goes straight to paying off debt?
@PennLabour this could possibly been financed through selling land and other assets. Why was this funded with money we don't have?
@PennLabour @LeeStanleyWV It is not per annum.
@PennLabour Cameron came to #Wolverhampton and we discussed it at the time with @ExpressandStar. Have regular discussions with both.
@PennLabour How much of the £0.5bn debt pool consists of those projects?
@WilliamJHague assured me that review will soon reach its conclusion, and its conclusions and findings will be published in the near future.
Today I questioned @WilliamJHague on the timeline for the inquiry and a possible statement to this House. #Amritsar
@LeeStanleyWV @WolvesCouncil @CYT_Wolves Collection rates, debt write off and debt interest are just some of the savings I have pointed out.
@LeeStanleyWV @WolvesCouncil @CYT_Wolves They have but I have found savings which they haven't. If we find savings we can protect services.
@LeeStanleyWV @CYT_Wolves For example, the council spend £25m a year servicing a debt pool of £0.5Bn. That is equivavlent to the deficit.
@LeeStanleyWV I think you will find @WolvesCouncil are choosing to cut @CYT_Wolves. I have found many instatnces of waste and mispent money.
I have just signed the petition to save @CYT_Wolves.
@MrsCompaneros I will also speak to Tim Loughton who is leading the campaign to ammend the law on still birth registration.

@Wolvopie That is another thing I am undertaking. Already found that WCC are £0.5bn in debt which is costing £25m per year to service.
@tom_watson I have written to the PM thanking him for taking swift action. Any process must be transparent so we have confidence in outcome
@tom_watson I have stated that all remaining documents should be released, including the months and days leading up to and after the attack.
We still need your support, over 2.5k have signed the petition, but we still need disclosure of documents. http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
I will be on the BBC this afternoon discussing the great news that the PM has ordered an investigation into Amritsar.
@UKChange We are still not finished we still need the UK Government to disclose all relevant documentation. #Amritsar
@priyaatwal Lord Singh and NSO been appointed by FCO to examine the case.
@SikhFedUK There is a gap in correspondence between February and June '84. The advice may have been ignored or plans changed.
@SikhFedUK We simply do not know at this moment. This is why we are investigating to find out what advice was given.
@SikhFedUK We need to establish the facts first and this is what we are doing. The PM has taken action today to answer serious questions.
@SikhFedUK The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts regarding Amritsar.
@paulwaugh The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts.
Almost 1000 people have signed the petition calling for an enquiry. Thank you very much for your support.
Great to see the PM has listened to the concerns of the Sikh community and has asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish the facts.
"These events led to a tragic loss of life and we understand the very legitimate concerns that these papers will raise." HMG
The Prime Minister has asked the Cabinet Secretary to look into this case urgently and establish the facts regarding Amritsar.
@_JasvirSingh @HarjitSarang I have spoken to No10 this evening and they are treating this with the upmost importance.
@TheBloopster Thanks, will get back as soon as possible.
@paulwaugh speaking to Number 10 I have pressed the need for an inquiry into the Amritsar/SAS revelations.
@CatrinNye I have just spoken to Number 10 pressing for the need for an enquiry.
I pressed the need for an inquiry that tackles the questions which were raised this morning. We need answers at this difficult time.
I have just spoken to Number 10 over the serious allegations that were raised this morning regarding the UK's involvement in Amritsar.
@guardian I am calling for an enquiry to answer the many questions posed by the Amritsar SAS disclosure.
Sikhs demand inquiry into claims of British role in 1984 Amritsar attack http://t.co/Y83yVgfts1 via @guardian
@_JasvirSingh @HarjitSarang There are many questions still to be answered, most importantly the nature of the plans.
@HarjitSarang @_jasvirsingh just to show how many people support the call for a full investigation. Together we can get the answers we need.
@_JasvirSingh @HarjitSarang I will be speaking to the PM at the earliest opportunity. Already spoke to his PPS today.
@bobbyfriction I am sorry to hear, it is a story we see far too often. Thank you for your support, we are in serious need of answers.
@Talwar_Punjabi We need answers, who was involved and what assiatance was given. Support my call for an enquiry here http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
@bobbyfriction Agree, we need answers and will be speaking to the PM. In the meantime call for an urgent inquiry here http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
@Captain_Bhangra support a full enquiry here. http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF With your help we can get the answers we need.
@NavtaijSangha Thanks for your support. We will find out exactly what happened in 1984.
Over 100 people call for enquiry into UK involvement in Amritsar. Are you one? http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
@Harinder1977 I will be pushing for a debate, we need to ascertain what exactly went on in '84.
I will be pressing for a debate on UK involvement in Amritsar and calling for a full enquiry. You can support it too. http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
@Harinder1977 They have to be considered but no debate is guaranteed. I will be asking for a debate on Thursday on this crucial issue.
@HarjapBhangal You can support my call for a full investigation here  http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF.
@HarjapBhangal It was an investigative journalist who uncovered it. After seeing the story I called for a full enquiry.
@SikhFedUK I have already called on the Government to launch a full enquiry into British involvement.
@_PSingh_ Thank you for your support. The Sikh community deserve answers to these revelations.
@Kully_Dhillon As a Sikh MP I will be speaking to the PM later urging him to launch an urgent investigation into British involvement.
@Kevin_Maguire Agree, this is why I am calling for an urgent inquiry into the events that led up to the attack in 1984.
@Sikh2Inspire you can also sign my petition asking for an urgent inquiry. We need to show the strength of feeling! http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
Ask the Government to launch an urgent inquiry into Britain's involvement in the attack on the Golden Temple. http://t.co/z2YH00rHgF
@Sikh2Inspire I will be speaking to the Government later urging them to launch an urgent investigation into British involvement.
Further, all remaining correspondence should be released, including the months and days leading up to and after the attack.
@PreeceRobert I am urging the Government to launch an urgent investigation into British involvement.
I am calling on the Government to launch an urgent inquiry into British involvement in the attack on the Golden Temple.
The file stops short of detailing the precise nature of the plan, so it is not clear how it relates to the Indian Government’s response.
I am concerned to see documentation that implicated British Special Forces in the 1984 attack on the Golden Temple in Amritsar.
JLR coming to #Wolverhampton is another example of the revival and successes of British car manufacturing.
This Government has already created 260,000 new school places and this announcement means thousands more are on the way.
This means that between 2014 and 2017 schools in Wolverhampton will receive over £7.5m.
This government has announced an extra £2.35bn to create more school places. This is in addition to the £5bn that is already being spent.
@DrEoinCl the number of young people claiming JSA is down over 100k since 2010.
The number of young people not in education, employment or training is at the lowest for a decade.
I am working hard for the people of Wolverhampton SW, delivering a more secure future for those who want to work hard and get on in life.
These figures show that our plan to fix the economy is working, getting people off benefits and into work.
Since 2010, unemployment and youth unemployment in Wolverhampton South West is down.
Great to see employment in the #WestMidlands up by 23,000 this quarter, and up by 60,000 since the election.
Under this Government we’ve helped councils freeze council tax. This saving is worth up to £147 on a Band D home.
Under Labour Council Tax doubled. Don’t let them hit hard working families across Wolverhampton.
Just reading @WolvesCouncil financial plan. Dissapointing to see plans to increase Council Tax by 2% a year. #ChallengeWV

Do you think parking charges in Wolverhampton should be increased? Have your say. http://t.co/phWDuMuBQz
Wolverhampton Council should be providing solutions not problems. My new article. http://t.co/phWDuMuBQz
@WolvesCouncil say there is a risk to the economy because shoppers may be deterred from visiting the city. Is this a price worth paying?
@socialistvilla percentage ‘reductions are generally smaller for the most deprived areas and larger for the less deprived areas.
@ExpressandStar They should implement policies that support local businesses, not ones that harm them.
@ExpressandStar Local government must begin to view health of the local business community as the health of their own organisation.
Association of Town & City Management say that car parking charges cannot be viewed one dimensionally as a simple revenue source.
@MartinJTelf The Council should be doing more to make sensible savings. That's what I'm fighting for! #ChallengeWV
This includes improving collection rates. There is a total of £2.4 billion of uncollected council tax across England.
Councils account for 25% of all spending. It is vital they continue to help tackle the inherited budget deficit by making sensible savings.
@putasinghonit Increased parking charges in Wolverhampton will only make this worse. We should be encouraging people into the city.
@baptistjon of course not I'm looking to protect services across the city including voluntary groups and Central Baths.
@baptistjon Which is why I'm urging @WolvesCouncil to improve collection rates and use the money it is owed to protect services.
Don't let the council harm businesses, sign the petition here. http://t.co/UHjVWCzxBd #ChallengeWV
@ExpressandStar we should not be looking at ways to save money that could harm businesses. Increased parking charges do just that!
Dismayed to see that @wolvescouncil are looking to increase parking charges in tonight’s @ExpressandStar.
Great visit to @JacobsJams this morning, run by enterprising local businessesman Jordan Bowen #SmallBusinessSaturday http://t.co/2DMPtFv9xv
Sign the petition to #ChallengeWV to save local services by finding alternative ways to reduce budget deficit here: http://t.co/UHjVWCzxBd
@PennLabour This is a crude lobbying exercise is based on made up extrapolations designed to scaremonger rather than inform public debate.
@PennLabour Excluding London, northern regions have larger start-up funding assessments and revenue spending power per dwelling.
@PennLabour for expenditure/funding measures, deprived areas generally receive higher per dwelling allocations than less deprived areas.
@PennLabour Council funding is fair to north, south, rural and urban areas.
@PennLabour Will you support our campaign to seek ways to improve collection rates and reduce the number of cuts? #ChallengeWV
@PennLabour do you know in cash terms how much Wolverhampton has failed to collect in the previous 5 years?
@PennLabour @ExpressandStar do you agree that improving collection rates reduces the future risk of writing that debt off?
@PennLabour Cllr Johnson stated that @WolvesCouncil are only £3.3m short over a 5yr period. Do your figures support this claim?
@PennLabour interesting that your figures seem to contradict those given by Cllr Andrew Johnson in the @ExpressandStar.
@paulwaugh hope we can restore faith in the game. Sadly it is not just football experiencing these problems but snooker and cricket too.
Councils write off outstanding arrears when they consider it uneconomical to
collect them. #ChallengeWV
If councils do not collect all the council tax due to them within the year it is due, arrears
accumulate.#ChallengeWV
Depending on the amount uncollected, it may impact on their ability to fund services as people expect.
Where council tax goes uncollected it can deprive councils of the resources they need to deliver their spending plans.
Today I asked @WolvesCouncil how much money was lost in ‘write offs’ in the last 10 years. #ChallengeWV
As your MP, I want to listen to what's important to you - please take a few moments to complete the survey below! https://t.co/ljtKkJ5DS5
Brilliant evening in Tettenhall for the switching on of the Christmas lights. Great to see so many turn out! http://t.co/9MK6UG8ZPI
@PennLabour I asked if your figures include debt that is written off. If they do how much has been written off over the last 5 years?
@PennLabour implies all outstanding council tax is collected. Is it the case that some Council Tax and Business Rate debt is written off?
@PennLabour What about your plans to raise council tax in Wolverhampton? Council tax not collected means a larger burden for everyone.
@PennLabour Are you happy with 95.6%? An increase reduces the future risk of writing that debt off. Other councils are collecting above 98%
@PennLabour A scandalous claim! We have moved to help households bring down their monthly bills by spreading payments over the year.
@PennLabour by your own figures that is amount outstanding. Does that include debt that has had to be written off?
@PennLabour I am standing up for Wolverhampton by looking at ways to protect services across this city.
@PennLabour Councils account for a quarter of all public spending,the reduced funding is due to the inherited budget deficit.
Sign up to our mailing list to be the first to hear updates on #ChallengeWV here - http://t.co/UHjVWCzxBd
@PennLabour Ratepayers will be dismayed with your complacent attitude to improving @WolvesCouncil collection rates. #ChallengeWV
@PennLabour Why aren't we asking @WolvesCouncil to do better when there is clearly room for improvement. #ChallengeWV
@PennLabour The point I was making is Cllr Jonson is saying collection rates are "very good" when they are below the national average.
DCLG figures show last year @wolvescouncil collected 96.5% of council tax, this was below the national average of 97.4%.
Councillor Johnson said last night "Our collection performance is very good" This is simply not true #ChallengeWV
"If the shortfall was repeated over the 5yr cuts programme, it would add up to £30m - most of which would boost council coffers"
@CllrIanAngus I stand by my figures in last night's @ExpressandStar
GMB says it is a scandal and a disgrace that vital services are being slashed when more than £1bn is going uncollected in rates.
@CllrIanAngus Head of GMB says these figures should not be dismissed as distortions or exaggerations as many of them (councils) will do.
@CllrIanAngus even GMB survey supports my facts. See @ExpressandStar article from 2012. http://t.co/1zNq8FQCnS
In @ExpressandStar I argue @WolvesCouncil may be facing a budget deficit, but are facing a moral deficit in deciding to cut vital services.
In tonight's @ExpressandStar I talk about #ChallengeWV in article "Collect debts and save on services, says MP"

@HungryBistro Thanks, I'll look forward to it #apprenticeships #PortasPilot #Regeneration
The £30m owed accounts for just under half of all cuts announced by @WolvesCouncil. #ChallengeWV #Missing30m
The shortfall in collection by @WolvesCouncil is condemning loved local services such as Central Baths #missing30m #ChallengeWV
Thanks @napatory I will be looking at the figures to see how much @WolvesCouncil is owed in arrears. #ChallengeWV
Central Baths are likely to close. Join the campaign to protect the baths by signing http://t.co/ceGvCIXC6Y and following @centralbaths.

This adds up to £30m over the 5yr budget period and could be used by @WolvesCouncil to protect vital services. #ChallengeWV #Missing30m
@geoffjellis I will be raising the issue in Parliament on Thursday to ensure that vital services are protected across the city.
Did you know last year @WolvesCouncil failed to collect £6m in business rates and council tax? #ChallengeWV
@WolvesCouncil say there is now no way to address the budget shortfall without considerable pain. This is not true. #ChallengeWV
@WolvesCouncil want you to believe that there are no alternatives to the cuts ... #ChallengeWV
@staceyumax best of luck! Let me know how you get on.
@centralbaths that's me! Shame I didn't catch you if you were there. Look forward to hearing from you.
@centralbaths No prob, look forward to hearing from you!

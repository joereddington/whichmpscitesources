@AlexSchillemore Ah.  Problem.  Hope you're happy to be the recipient of my first tweet for a year and a half!
@AlexSchillemore Have you tried Shazam?
Canvassing in Bishops Waltham
Radio Solent interview today
Great game! 5-2 great performance from H&W
4-2 H&W, Really good game!
At Westleigh park watching Havant and Waterlooville in the sunshine. Penalty for the Hawks.... 2-2
Off to Waterlooville for a street surgery with the mobile surgery.
Excellent debate tonight in Waltham Chase.  150 people, good time keeping and sharp questions.
Big difference this election is email. Vast amounts arriving. Hard to keep up.
No sign of movement to LDs in MV. Canvassing solid and loads of poster requests.
Street surgery and canvassing all day. Only a few people mention debate. Clegg obviously did well but it doesn't seem to be changing votes.
@gstopani Doesn't matter what I think . .  Opinion out there seems to be Clegg 8, Cam 6.5, Brown 4.  Concur?
@paulwaugh Saved NI increase that would have been paid by NHS is being used to fund drug promise
@ajwilcox Sorry.  Only just caught up with this.  Yup, it will have been me on the way to I've no idea where.
Finally a debate where some people turned up. 97 in Cowplain. Still only three Qs. With 6 candidates things move very slowly.
@gstopani Just try and stop them.  My three from 17 to 12 use it all the time to stay in touch, arrange fun and whinge about their parents!
@gaborelectric Bill seems overly authoritarian to me.  Artists deserve to have rights protected but not at the expense of our liberty.
@gaborelectric Education, Freedom and driving power downwards
@gaborelectric Mmmm.  Really?  I'm 500 yards outside, lived here for 15 years and been a Winchester councillor for 11. This is where I live.
@gaborelectric ref candidates living in #MeonVy, which one would that be?
Vox pops in papers driving me mad: "Tories have no details".  Why don't people actually look?  If anything we've got too much detail.
Here we go again. It's groundhog day. Beautiful morning, thousands of leaflets and thousands of labels to stick . . . #MeonVy
How on earth did the Labour mail out to cancer sufferers ever see the light of day? What were they thinking? http://bit.ly/d9FxYe
3 debates last week.  Not for me to comment on winners and losers but not enough attendees to be of influence.
Canvassing in #MeonVy feels firm for Cons.  Still the largest change though is for abstension.
@gaborelectric They've only just been created so no great surprise.  Sorry to hear about your Dad.  No fun.  Been somewhere similar.
@alexschillemore Nope.  Mr Harris has had a full bottle of orange (and prob 2 twixes and a pack of polos in his pocket just in case)
Portsmouth News debate last night but very disappointing turnout.  Prob only 40 people there.  Mind you, it was a beautiful Friday evening.
@gaborelectric #MeonVy is the tag for tweets about MV constituency in the election.  Full list of all constituencies http://bit.ly/dfDui6
@gaborelectric In BW for street surgery 10:00 to 12:00. Any good?
60 or so in the hall for debate. Bit of a moment when UKIP rep. Steve Harris had a diabetic turn in the middle of answering a question.
Climate Change debate in Horndean tonight.  Kicks off at 7pm.  See you there?
Wed a.m. Lady complaining about "people waiting for deportment".  Couldn't help the mental image of Abu Hamza with pile of books on his head
@HampshireLawyer errrr . . .  I am!
As first election leaflet goes out, the number of people in contact goes up exponentially.  I can plot hour by hour where we are delivering.
So both we and the LDs chose to work in Bishops Waltham HIgh St this a.m. (well they did for about ten minutes)
Useful checklist from Guardian on Liberties.  Think it needs an option for "Not sure" though.  http://bit.ly/c5YJm4
First hustings tonight. Debate on SDA in Botley. Sitting next to Chris Huhne on a platform is a bit nerve wracking but I think it went OK.
Equitable Life victims to be compensated by an incoming Tory Government.  Brilliant news.  http://bit.ly/auefhh
Been running a street surgery in Waterlooville every Friday for six months.  Snow, wind, rain but never yet warm and sunny.  Is it me?
http://twitpic.com/1ccf05 - The egg in the fireplace
Broken vase on kitchen floor this a.m. Unhappy looking Tawny owl on window sill and egg in fireplace! I know it's April 1st, but really.
We're about 80% of the way stuck.  Strange how repetitive tasks can be quite compelling.
Thought #chancellorsdebate was a really positive development.  Hardly unbiased so no opinions from me but it was civilised and constructive.
Today is label sticking day.  With only 17p spend allowed per elector in the GE proper, all campaigning is make do and mend.
@davidlancashire Don't bother if you use an older Mac like 'cos it doesn't work.
Ta Unite. My family's flight on Sunday to Miami for 50th anniversary party for my mother in law and her deeply unwell husband cancelled.
Latest LD Botley Focus a disgrace on SDA. If you have to twist the truth like that to get elected, I really can't see the point in standing
OK, so now British Gas employees are going on strike.  This is going well.
Farming meeting in Corhampton, then Equitable Life meeting in Hamble and evening canvassing in Waterlooville.
@alexschillemore What's the business?  She's in Manor Road in Durley.
@mpntod Amazing how many people can be out on a Saturday . . .
@alexschillemore A good friend has fab Labrador puppies.  Ready early May.  Sheena Judd on 01489 860685
Visit to Southwick first and then to Waterlooville this a.m.  PB reports YouGov changing their sampling method slightly.
Canvassing a.m.  Afternoon meeting with band and sound team for AFNFN Ball.  Jazz, Latin, Salsa, World and Rock venues.  Going to be fab.
Out canvassing Hart Plain this a.m. Visit to Astrium p.m. Satellite manufacturer with £1bn of kit in the clean room. Not your usual visit!
Dinner with the BBC. Learned a lot.
@Peter_Henley Tell!
OK.  Guardian sub doing graphics couldn't read his own paper properly.  It's 100k contacts made in 90 constituencies. http://bit.ly/deAETQ
Today's Guardian says 100k Unite activists canvassing 90 marginals.  What?  1,100 in each?  Prove it.  Sounds like utter nonsense to me.
@Joanne_Cash Have you got a link to the letter we could see? Been face to face with them for 12 years now.
Our charity ball, "A final Night for Naomi", looks like selling out. 65 tables sold. Just 15 to go. Book now! http://bit.ly/ccJDtY
Canvassing this evening and, for the first time in all my political life, real numbers switching from LD to us.
Gordon Brown thinks the BA strike is "unjustified and comes at the wrong time". I don't think he's thinking of the passengers, do you?
Direct mail to UKIP voters seems to be striking a chord.
He's related to the short order chef. Nightie night. Country bumkin off for some Zs
@mpntod Just had a drink with Liz in the Brush in Upham.  We found a mutual friend in my best man's sister.  A small world gets smaller.
@mpntod Just call me Imelda from Alresford.
@Nickking Yes (or so says this PPC)
@LuckyAitkens Talk about a bizarre episode. Was just polling through Twitter and saw 'Alresford'. Followed the link and up came my shoes!
Vince Cable and Martin Tod (LD PPC) visit cobbler in Alresford only to be trumped on live TV by my shoes. Yes, really.  http://j.mp/d4aOtj
@LuckyAitkens Can't all be high flying media sorts darling. J away in FLA.  Xan and I on a boys' night in.   Making tracks on Garageband.
If you've got an iPhone and you're going canvassing, download the Conservative iPhone app.  It's a useful tool.
@deerstalker Arm's in plaster
@BettyBoop1938 Certainly was.
Just had Assoc. AGM.  Very lucky with my group.  So supportive and such great people.
Gypsies becoming big issue in MV.  Difficult 'cos of racial overtones.  But why do some people have special planning rights?  Who qualifies?
Much talk on political sites re. Ashcroft. Game changed they say. Spent all day with normal people. Subject never came up at all.
Latest LD letter on Botley SDA twists truth to within a turn of breaking point. Is it really necessary to grossly mislead to win?
Got to love an anorak. LD mag being del'vd with pic of race on back. Yellow jockey ahead of blue. Mate id'd the race. Blue won by a length!
Been out delivering.  17 versions of an 8 page annual report take some getting out.
@LuckyAitkens This looks pretty good. http://bit.ly/pI4Rr.  Never been though.
@LuckyAitkens Not since Pacific Time closed.  It reopened again in the garment district.  Not easy to get to.
@LuckyAitkens Aaaaaagh!  That's my lighthouse, not yours.
Waterlooville surgery. Almost every person complaining about the unfairness of paying tax all your life and getting nothing when you need it
@LuckyAitkens and @jamesfletcheruk I dislike you both intensely . . .
On the telephones in Swanmore tonight.  Finally got Merlin to produce lists limited to those with numbers.  Hooray!
You see.  The BBC is brim full of left wingers on a mission.  Dr Who as political pamphlet!  http://bit.ly/a5Z4ez.
MIssed the announcement about £6m to monitor MPs pay this a.m. Oh dear!
@LucyAitkens.  Where are you?
Telephone canvassing tonight in Durley, Curdridge & Upham.
"We are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons."  Took a while!  Why now I wonder? http://bit.ly/cZDOCI
@alexschillemore My guess is you did . . .

A new client for the Kebab Van today. http://bit.ly/dwTnMj
@BruceWebster Nice to see you here
Will today's announcements of prosecutions on expenses finally draw a line under the whole thing?
Feeling rubbish with a heavy cold.  Tomorrow holds an early surgery with trailer in Waterlooville and then to Cameron do near Petersfield
Big society not big government.
Bureaucracy, form filling, more money for living apart, don't work more, promote responsibility. Will lead to compassion.
Marriage, responsibility? State too big, choose your own school
Listening to Cameron in Battersea.
Just about to set off for big Cameron fundraiser in Battersea Park.
How extraordinary is that Times article on the Audit Commission?  Could anything make a stronger case for the Bonfire of the quangos?
Cowplain was really good. Six new deliverers.
Canvassing and street surgery in Cowplain today from 10:00.
Mates and his of course
Listening to Michael Mayes at hi farewell dinner. Excellent.
@LuckyAitkens talk to my cuz
@jamesfletcherUK OK, I'll admit that looks kinda fun.
Pets at Home sold for close to £1bn. Some of you will know how that makes me feel . . . .
Beginning to get lots of round robin emails:  Albion Alliance, hunting, climate change etc. etc.  At least 10 this week so far
@alexschillemore I guess that depends how far it is between stations . . .
Also seems very expensive (add a 3G contact for mobile browsing).

Not sure what the iPad is for.  Haven't got a pocket big enough for an iPhone on steroids. http://bit.ly/bUhw8j
@Nickking Gov ads all over TV too.  Endless teacher, road safety, 5 a day, save energy stuff.
Just off to press meeting and then election planning session.
Finally got the Nick Herbert visit finalised for Thursday.  Mind you, they haven't said yes yet.
On my own tonight.  J away, Xan away, Jess on exchange, Brooke in Wiltshire.  Work . . .
Hullo Mail download. http://bit.ly/6D7tMN
But you can install Hullo Mail app to do the same thing
@jamesfletcherUK not happy that Vodafone don't do Visual Voicemail . . but reception streets better.  Guess I'm happier.
Could be something on N.I. Or maybe officially coming out if recession . . . or is Michael Jackson back?
@alexschillemore It's taken a while and still inconsistent but I'll keep trying!
Rumours abound that ministers are crowding into No.10 to hear about a Feb election date.  Mmmm. Don't believe it.
In London for a dinner at Policy Exchange. Arrive to find I'm not on the list. Oops. Poor admin skills.
Would you want to be on a luxury liner anchored in Haiti behind a 12 foot fence, eating burgers and riding a jet ski?
Hey Gordon!  What about the recession, destroyed pensions, negative real savings rates, no long term care . . . shall I go on?
Brown as champion of the middle classes?  What?  He spends the last 12 years ripping them off and now wants to be their friend.

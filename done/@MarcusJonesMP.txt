@MarcusJonesMP
@JTomlinsonMP hope he knows who the council leader is and who controls the council this time!!
@thenuns great result. Keep it up Nuns!
Positive day out campaigning on the doorsteps of #Whitestone and #Kingswood - #Nuneaton with @NuneatonMatters and @CllrKrisWilson.
well done to ASDA #Nuneaton staff for organising and baking cakes for @BBCCiN. Tough job judging the winner!! http://t.co/YEwnTisptr
Excellent night at the Higham Lane School #Nuneaton awards evening. #Welldone
Unemployment has reduced in #Nuneaton by 47% since May 2010. More people earning a wage. I am working to secure full employment in Nuneaton.
@daynegilbey Not sure. Think its an access for plant to support the station build.
@gunny1979 Completely agree with your assessment of the spelling. Fundamentally disagree with your view of Nuneaton.
@daynegilbey my understanding is that the access will be on St Georges Way - opposite Bookers.
youth unemployment in #Nuneaton now 50% lower than 12 months ago. Great news, but still more to do to deliver full youth employment in Nun.
Proud to support the first @WorldPancreatic Cancer Day today http://t.co/5y73uLQKeE #WPCD2014
Lovely Armistice Day service in #Bedworth this morning. Good to see so many school children,800 there I was told. http://t.co/H7jkG3Ehlr
@BattlefieldBen this, the VAT rebate on the Tower of London poppies and the extension of the war widows pension are excellent decisions.
@cc_cotonGriff I will help in any way I can. Please e-mail me with more details. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
On my way to the Armistice Day service in #Bedworth today. Hundreds of school children from #Nuneaton will be there. #lestweforget
An enjoyable afternoon in @SainsburysPR #Nuneaton collecting for the Poppy Appeal. Nuneaton people are so generous http://t.co/5X4uxOf7XU
Good morning campaigning in a very soggy #Attleborough #Nuneaton. Thanks to the @NuneatonMatters team for braving the elements.
Enjoyed opening the Linden Grange Care Home in #Hartshill. What a friendly and welcoming place with great facilities. http://t.co/mExF6Dttci
@NBBCouncil this is disastrous news. Who ever introduced American Signal Crayfish to the UK has a lot to answer for.
@FilletWorld all good life experience. Good job that not all of us believed their version of events!
@FilletWorld amazing what you can forget! Yes - I have never been keen on such material. That sort of stuff was why I entered politics.
@FilletWorld very wise! Hope you are well.
@FilletWorld by the way. Great photo, they were the days! I wonder what happened to Clive!
@FilletWorld all due to a ridiculously put together local plan. If it were more balanced this would not be required.
@greennuneaton This is all being caused by the flawed @NBBCouncil Borough Plan that Labour are trying to force on Nuneaton.
@BattlefieldBen @NBBCouncil Completely agree that it would be fitting to honour the contribution of our Gurkha community in such a way.
Just expressed my concerns and support in HOC for #Nuneaton based Rolls-Royce workers following yesterdays announcement by the company.
@Official_NTFC sounds like Boro played very well. Very honest assessment from @tividale_fc  good luck to them for the rest of the season.
@hockley_rachel @BermudaBridgeAG If I am available I can attend. Please can you e-mail details. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
@crankshaw_lisa Please can you e-mail over some more details. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
@hockley_rachel I certainly will if I am available. Please e-mail me with the details. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
Attended a fabulous concert tonight performed by the Atherstone Choral Society. Very poignant tribute to the First World War.
Good session this morning out canvassing in #Kingswood ward #Nuneaton with @NuneatonMatters.
@hockley_rachel as an MP I don't have a vote on WCC. I didn't vote for opening the bridge and don't think I would given the views expressed.
@hockley_rachel as an MP I don't have a vote on WCC - thus I did not vote. I understand you have concerns and I do not support this idea.
@spikey_richie I have checked my Facebook and don't have a message. Can you please e-mail. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
@GaryCRidley well done and best of luck Gary.
Pleased to speak about our section of the A5 in HOC tonight. Am determined to get a study on how we can give a real solution for #Nuneaton.
Voted tonight for the Goldsmith amendment to the Recall Bill. Unfortunately the amendment was defeated.
@craig4nwarks great stuff - keep it up Craig - it will be worth it.
Sporting a pink shirt today in support of @BCCampaign . A very worthy cause. #wearitpink
@ayestotheright planned. That said- might start looking around now to replace my old Blackberry.
Lovely Harvest Festival assembly at Queens CofE Academy #Nuneaton. Very talented young people who will no doubt be an asset to our area.
Interesting visit to the 3 shop in #Nuneaton to learn about their roll out of 4G mobile service in Nuneaton - later this year.
@BattlefieldBen I hope that they can secure premises. I have pledged some time to collect for the appeal.
@BattlefieldBen it would be good if they could help, but in fairness to them they own very few shops. Can you DM me with more details?
@NuneatonMatters residents views must be taken into account. Any plans to open the bridge would have a fundamental impact.
Voted today for a Bill to give the British people a referendum on #EU membership. Let's hope Labour/Lib Dems don't stop Bill in the Lords!
A big thanks to all those businesses in our area that have helped reduce unemployment in #Nuneaton by 44% since 2010.
Unemployment in #Nuneaton is down by 44% since May 2010. More to do - but our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
663 less people unemployed in #Nuneaton than this time last year. More to do, but great news that more people have the security of a job.
@greennuneaton True and weekly earnings per residence have increased.
@greennuneaton @danielbyles I have just checked the ONS statistics and it says that average pay in Nuneaton & Bedworth  has increased.
Good to join the #Nuneaton Sikh community this morning at the Marlborough Road Gurdwara.
Lovely evening meeting #Nuneaton people at the Greek Church of Coventry. Such a friendly and hospitable community. http://t.co/MQPJDXvMS3
Pleased to support new Stagecoach service from #Nuneaton to Birch Coppice giving access to hundreds of new jobs. http://t.co/IV0kmKwJQH
Great to see HRH Earl of Wessex visit Nuneaton this afternoon to open a  new building at @KECNuneaton.
@Gilo Good luck and all the best in your new role. Unless that is you are playing Warwickshire!
Great night watching @Official_NTFC . Magnificent 3-2 win for the Boro!
@RedHueTory I have no objection as long as its done legally and with consideration for others.

@FimusTauri please can you e-mail and elaborate on your concerns. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
Great to see @onebiggins at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. #CPC14 http://t.co/uL6JzAFpmj
@greennuneaton the figures show that the gap between rich and poor is slowly narrowing.
@greennuneaton rich paying more tax. 3,000 Nuneaton people taken out of income tax all together. Will be more after next election.
What a barnstormer from Cameron. True leadership. Stark choice next May between true leadership from Cam and the weakness of Mill.
@davidmiles_01 I'm told that the travellers have moved on this morning.
@davidmiles_01 Thanks for the message. I have contacted the owners of the land to find out what steps they are taking about this issue.
@28ff7b088b304fa well done Paul. Well deserved.
Thank you to @NOERFC1 for inviting me to today's game. A thoroughly enjoyable afternoon with great people and a great atmosphere.
Great afternoon at #Nuneaton Old Ed's Rugby Club. Poignant  commemoration before the game for Old Ed's lost in WW1. http://t.co/il5mKvZuGY
Looking forward to the @oakfmradio Pride of H&N awards. Good luck to the nominees. #prideofhn
@OfBeans @MaryAnslow @VisitHelmsley @Galtres @BenAhmed please can you e-mail with more information. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
I've been to Shire Hall today to meet with County Councillors to put the case for keeping the Opportunities Centre in Camp Hill open.
@TruSkyBlue @EveryoneActive sorry to hear that. You need to formally complain to EA. Beyond that I would complain to @NBBCouncil.
@aprosser35 @WarwickshirePCC the PCC can tell you more but I am not aware of that being a possibility.
More to do, but encouraged that unemployment in #Nuneaton is 44% lower than in May 2010. >1,000 people now taking home a pay packet.
@angela_whelan very good meeting. It's never easy to get results, but we got our message across very well.
@THENUNEATONFOX @LondonMidland @VirginTrains on the first floor. You just need to go to the ASDA help desk, they will direct you.
Come to the community room at ASDA #Nuneaton to discuss rail services. Drop-in 10am-3pm today. @LondonMidland @VirginTrains @crosscountryuk
Have your say on #Nuneaton rail services - today at ASDA Nuneaton 10am-3pm. @VirginTrains @LondonMidland @networkrail & @crosscountryuk
Visit to @abbeynuneaton ,canvassing with @NuneatonMatters ,watching CCFC win and off shortly to a Nuneaton Choral Society performance. #busy
Great behind the scenes visit to @abbeynuneaton this morning. Excellent volunteers running a great small theatre. #theatre #Nuneaton
@ClaireH_NN great guy and ambassador for Nuneaton.
@cpttamworth @NWarksConserv well done Craig. I am sure you will be a great candidate and MP.
Attended launch of #Cov&Warks Growth Deal. Great speeches from Lord Heseltine, Jonathan Browning, @gregclarkmp & Izzi Seccombe. #growthdeal
@preeds131 I have been pushing for this. Will make point again on Tuesday.
I appreciate some #Nuneaton commuters can't get to my drop-in with the rail co's. Please e-mail any points & I will take them up with co's.
Come to Asda #Nuneaton to give @LondonMidland @VirginTrains and Network Rail your views on local rail issues. Tue 16 September 10am-3pm.
@anneholland79 @NWarksCops thank you for letting me know. It sounds like another bad one.
@ncc1826_1stteam Enjoyed today's game.Thank you for the warm welcome and great banter.
Excellent afternoon at #Nuneaton CC watching Ashley Giles playing for Nuneaton. Fantastic ambassador for cricket. http://t.co/KOL4EVFvNn
@NWHCPublicServ glad to hear that. Look forward to meeting your students here in Parliament later this year.
@aprosser35 that's a shame. Hope you are happy in your new home.
@aprosser35 I believe that people in genuine need should be helped, but I also believe in the principle of you get rewarded for hard work.
@aprosser35 and we are providing more help with childcare when both parents work. Important to support those who do the right thing.
@aprosser35 Parents important but can't hold children responsible. Education in early years gives better life chances= less burden on state.
@covtelegraph remember the special CCFC editions of the Telegraph in 1987? I still have them all!
Looking forward to tomorrow night. Let's all sing together play up Sky Blues....... #PUSB
@Martin_Barber please write to me with any concerns.
@CllrKrisWilson another really bad decision being made by a Labour Council who don't care about local people. #Letdownbylabour
Spoke in tonight's HOC debate on hospital parking charges. Pleased to join colleagues in the call for free parking at our NHS hospitals.
@ClaireH_NN @NuneatonNews This is a completely unnaceptable position for local people to be left in. #Nuneaton #Labour #politicsbeforepeople
Supporting local #Nuneaton cricket team in a final in Bradford. Good weather and a great game.
@Mark_Aldrich not many people I know!
Sympathise with fellow #CCFC fans trying for tickets. I was locked out of the ticket office earlier. Website impossible! #frustrated #PUSB
Great result for @nuneatontown_fc @GazDean05 today. Now they are off the mark it will hopefully be the first success of many.
@TheRMcQ1986 TR
@Mark_Aldrich 2% of workforce is zero hours. Gov't making these contracts fairer.
@greennuneaton 36,000 Nun people have had a large income tax cut. Over 3,000 taken out of income tax all together.
@greennuneaton As usual you ignore that many Nun people work elsewhere as has been the case for decades.
@CllrKrisWilson or even Labour's Great Recession. Spend more, borrow more. #sameoldlabour
@CllrKrisWilson The worry is that he does not think him or Labour did anything wrong, despite presiding over the Labour's Great Recession.
Ed Balls in #Nuneaton today, perhaps he can explain why unemployment down by 41% and 1400 more people in employment since Lab left office.
@anneholland79 @NWarksCops @TrafficComplete @OFFICIALWMAS Terrible news. Let's hope that the improvements do make a difference.
@BermudaPlay Please can you advise the phone number that I need to call for children's parties? Many thanks.
@00SaeedSheikh00 I am going to do what I can to be there.
@TheRMcQ1986 should be starting very soon. Project will be good for people to access jobs and watch the Sky Blues!
@TheRMcQ1986 The station at the Ricoh should have been built with stadium. Today's news adds weight to why we need work to start ASAP.
@stuartwood98 @beciboots @NuneatonNews I am opposed to the proposal and have made representation to the NBBC planners.
@stuartwood98 I am opposed to this proposal and have made representation to NBBC planners.
@CCHQPress Great news for jobs in the West Midlands.
@stuartwood98 @beciboots @NuneatonNews I am opposed to this proposal and have made representation to NBBC.
@covtelegraph #bringCityhome #PUSB Excellent news - hopefully we can now start to move-on and bring better times for Sky Blues fans.
Best of luck to everyone in #Nuneaton collecting their GCSE results today.
I support @macmillancancer - UK cancer survival must match the best in Europe #LivesDependOnIt http://t.co/CtwLeBdVD2
@covtelegraph excellent news, let's hope its a positive move towards #bringCityhome
There are now 1024 less people unemployed in #Nuneaton than when Labour left office. More to do but we are making excellent progress.
Delighted that youth unemployment in #Nuneaton is down by 40% in the last 12 months. More to do but the #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
Pleased to hear that unemployment in #Nuneaton is down by 28% in the last 12 months. More to do but the #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
Met many #Arley and #OverWhitacre residents last night who have concerns about proposed green belt development on the old Daw Mill site.
@aprosser35 all very important issues.
Good drop-in surgery at McDonalds #Nuneaton this lunchtime. Lots of casework to bring back to the constituency office. #Pleasedtohelp

My family and I have Just attended a lovely, poignant service to commemorate the start of the First World War at #StNicolas church #Nuneaton
Just spent a few hours with #GalleyCommon #Nuneaton residents who are opposed to a potential large scale housing dev. #NBBC #NoBoroughPlan
@SandraEmmett I think that the major shareholder in Harworth is the Pension Protection Fund.
Happy Eid Mubarak to my Muslim friends and constituents.
@Skylar_xox that's great news. Thank the hard working people from Severn Trent water rather than me.
@Skylar_xox please can you email all the details about the location and I will look into it. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
Labours Great Recession was the deepest of any major economy and cost Britain six years. Still along way to go, but now on right track.
Great GDP figures thanks to the hard work of British people, today we have reached a major milestone in our #longtermeconomicplan
@anneholland79 Your Tory Cllr voted against it and was outnumbered by Labour. We will continue to fight against disproportionate development
@CllrKrisWilson @NBBCouncil #Labour #BoroughPlan yet again smoke and mirrors. No doubt Labour members will be whipped, as they were before.
@CllrKrisWilson Let down by Labour!!
@danielbyles You have done a fantastic job with some huge constituency issues to contend with. I am sorry that you are standing down.
@Aimetu I will do my best to attend this important debate.
@ThisledomeCG I hope that I can be there. I will look at the diary and come back to you.
@Mark_Aldrich terrible sight! I was watching The Boro and Coventry play and I have never seen weather like it!
Honoured last night to attend the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers central branch dinner. Good food and great company.  #Fusiliers
Attended lovely presentation assembly for leavers at #Stockingford Primary School in #Nuneaton. Well done and good luck at your new schools.
Delighted to attend the opening of the new waste recycling centre in #Nuneaton. Partnership between private, public and charitable sectors.
@DaveB59 only 2% of jobs zero hrs.
Youth unemployment in #Nuneaton down by 38% in last 12 months. More to do but on the right track. #LongTermEconomicPlan
Delighted at today's unemployment figures in #Nuneaton showing unemployment down by 26% in the last year. More to do but on right track.
@cu54sions @haswell99 #nuneaton let's hope so. I hope you have a good trading day on Saturday.
@AsiyaMam5a I am very concerned about the threat to innocent people and have made representation to the Foreign Secretary.
CQC give @GEHNHSnews Good rating and say that there has been a "remarkable turnaround". Well done to GEH staff. On right track, more to do.
@PeterR1947 missed it, will look. If its like the episode I saw it shows why the system needed and still needs more reform.
Congratulations to @NickyMorgan01 who will make an excellent Secretary of State for Education.
@greennuneaton look at the supplementary question, you will see that I am supporting the UK aero industry. Lot of Nuneaton jobs rely on it.
@emmyfarndon please can you e-mail me. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
@ClaireH_NN well done Warwickshire Police. Cannabis growing and use causes misery to the people who live close by.
As David Coleman used to say : Quite remarkable!! #WorldCup2014
@THENUNEATONFOX I was not a big fan. During the time of AWM the number of private sector jobs in the West Mids reduced.
@slakyak This is for the rail project only.
@martw17 no problem. Done.
Great news that money will be available under the Gov'ts Local Growth Fund to allow completion of the full #Nuneaton - Cov NUCKLE scheme.
Just spent an excellent few hours at @NunFest . No doubt they are in for a good night! #Nuneaton
Positive morning out canvassing in #Whitestone #Nuneaton. Local people were very anti Labours Borough Plan proposals.
@greennuneaton @cllrbutlin @danielbyles I agree, however the Lab Gov't of the time did not commit the money.
@greennuneaton @cllrbutlin @danielbyles 2011 not 10 yrs ago. Gov't funding not committed until 2012.
@greennuneaton @danielbyles That's not true Keith. The whole scheme is to be carried out. We would all like to see it happen more quickly.
@greennuneaton @danielbyles that's not true Keith. The whole scheme is being done, its just taking longer that we would like.
@greennuneaton @danielbyles We would all like sooner, but as you know Keith it is being upgraded.
@ClaireH_NN @NuneatonNews let's hope so.
@ClaireH_NN @NuneatonNews #Nuneaton From discussions that I have had. The people living around the old Fox and Crane will be very pleased.
Great news for the #Midlands with manufacturing growing at the fastest pace for a generation. #longtermeconomicplan http://t.co/1zf7tmQ7MZ

Research from the National Literacy Trust shows that 5.2m adults in #England can be described as ‘functionally illiterate’ #quickreads
Department for Education stats suggest that 1 in 5 adults will have some difficulty developing literacy skills #quickreads
The 2013 OECD findings on literacy rates in UK showed the scale of the problem of poor basic skills for many people #quickreads

This is a fantastic opportunity for businesses here in #Nuneaton to apply for funding to help them grow and create jobs.
The Fund has already supported companies such as Jaguar Land Rover.
The £3.2 billion fund supports projects using private sector investment to create jobs and growth.
The investment supports 114,000 jobs.
This follows £430m of funding allocated to the West Midlands region to 69 different bids, attracting £3.3bn of private investment.
Companies can bid for a share of £200 million to help them grow and create jobs.
I’m encouraging local business in my constituency to apply for Round 6 of the Regional Growth Fund.

CBI survey showing strongest growth for 10 yrs. Still more to do but on the right track. #LongTermEconomicPlan http://t.co/dYh9JiqMgF
@crankshaw_lisa I realise that, I am just enthusiastic at the prospect of the opportunities that can be created there.
@crankshaw_lisa Been engaged with MIRA for 4 years and am aware of the project. You are right that MIRA are the developers not the employers
@crankshaw_lisa MIRA state owned until mid 1970's - private since. This funding is to pump prime the new tech park and two thousand jobs.
@Aimetu @ClaireH_NN @PhilippaClare That's fabulous! Since we spoke I have been asked to represent the Government at the Leicester leg.
@NuneatonNews @cartwrighthands #Nuneaton excellent news that the 'King of Spain' is coming to play in #Nuneaton.
@JeffMorArbury Bad luck Jeff. Well done for all the excellent service that you gave in to Arbury residents in such a short time.
@Stuart_MCFC Because of these issues the hospital was put in special measures. It is now improving, but still more to do.
@Stuart_MCFC I am a strong supporter of the NHS - that's why I have spend so much time over the last 4years supporting the GEH.

@DanielLockyer Did Severn Trent deal with the leak yesterday?
@aprosser35 Agree, there is a lot more to do.
Great experience calling the numbers at The Grand Bingo hall in #chapelend #Nuneaton tonight. The cut to bingo tax is really appreciated.

@aprosser35 women now represent  20.4% of people on FSTE 100 boards up from 12.5% 2 years ago. Good news.
Great to see The Barrow Boys outside @GEHNHSnews selling and promoting fruit and veg. #fiveaday #Nuneaton http://t.co/1pz4MMvplV
@greennuneaton Thanks Keith. You are more than green stuff, but its usually negative and without regard the positive stuff locals are doing.
@greennuneaton Greens have a left wing agenda that is anti business and jobs. Never hear anything from you to say how we will create jobs.
@greennuneaton that's not what any of your leaflets say.
@greennuneaton unfortunately the Greens are even less positive than Labour. The only thing you are positive about is wind farms.
@greennuneaton Unfortunately the negativity that comes from those running NBBC can put investors off. Despite them things are improving.
@greennuneaton shame you can never welcome good news. We do need to create more local jobs. Local small firms are employing, but more to do.
@LenHardy must do what we can to support veterans who need work to get into a job.
@DanielLockyer will contact STW tomorrow to see what can be done to sort the leak asap.
Now 740 less people that are unemployed in #Nuneaton than there were in May 2010. More to do, but shows our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working
More to do, but unemployment down again in #Nuneaton and great figures on the number of people now in work. http://t.co/pQLUssjq0F
Just attended an important meeting with @edvaizey to discuss the roll out of rural broadband. Vital for #Arley #Ansley #Furnace End
Delighted to ask a question in the Commons in support of the excellent work of @VeteransCP and other organisations who support our veterans.
@aprosser35 great news, but more to do.
@aprosser35 far better than they were a few years ago.
@VeteransCP Great night supporting the youngsters of Nuneaton 121 ATC. Always keen to support veterans looking for work.
Good response this afternoon canvassing in #St Nicolas ward #Nuneaton. Just finished before the rain!
Good morning out campaigning in #Galley Common #Nuneaton. Weather just held for us!
Excellent night with #Nuneaton 121 ATC celebrating the squadrons 75th birthday. Great achievement and great night.
@skimberhome @NuneatonRocks @Official_NTFC #futureinsafehands well done guys, an excellent achievement that we can be very proud of.
@Mark_Aldrich you raise a very interesting point which should be considered.
@everimarc You might be interested to know that Nuneaton Tories are pledging to support @NBBCouncil Playrangers in their election manifesto.
@NTFC_Youth Well done on your achievement this season.
As people get paid in next few days many will notice that they will get to keep more of their salary before tax.  #forhardworkingpeople
Great honour this afternoon to attend the #Nuneaton and District Scouts St Georges Day Parade. Great afternoon. #well done
Great day campaigning in #Nuneaton town centre this morning -Weddington and St Nicolas pm. Looking forward to @thenuns club dinner tonight.
@ManorParkRFC1 Great news and experience for the lads. Sadly I can't be there.
Great news for #Midlands #manufacturing with production of new cars up 12% in March. More to do, but our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
Happy St Georges Day. #England #StGeorgesDay
I have never been keen on Leicester City but know many of my constituents are. Well done to them on winning promotion in such emphatic style
Unemployment in #Nuneaton down by 16% and youth unemployment by 24% in last 12 months. Great news, still more to do. #LongTermEconomicPlan
@CllrKrisWilson 2/2 Lab think by kicking it into the long grass everyone will forget before they vote on May 22nd.
@CllrKrisWilson V poor answer. They know their plan is flawed and they don't have the gumption to put it to the test. 1/2
@annakatinkaholz It would have been good to meet - no doubt we can speak next time that I am in your area.
@Steve_1772 would be good to have a proper chat. Please drop me an e-mail if you would find that of interest.
@simon_rouse thanks Simon.
@Mark_Aldrich I am the link between the Minister and back bench MPs - I am also there support the Minister during debates.
@EwolbLowe thank you to you both.
@00SaeedSheikh00 thank you.
@GooseGreen10 many thanks.
@aprosser35 thank you.
@JemjemJoanne thank you.
@golate1 Thanks Chris.
@simon_rouse Thanks Simon.
Delighted to have been appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the new Culture Secretary @sajidjavid .
@CllrKrisWilson People so angry with the way they are being treated with such contempt by Labour.
@Stuart_MCFC There are lots of reasons why one MP may spend more than another. Can depend on type and size of constituency and its issues.
@Stuart_MCFC All on the IPSA website.
Great point by @sajidjavid on Help to Buy on @bbcqt. Policy helping people who have not got bank of mum & dad for a deposit for a deposit.
@rwsutcliffe In favour of proportionate well planned dev. I am opposed to 700 on Long Shoot, no plan for infrastructure and disproportionate
@GregHands As usual they pedal the politics of fear and misinformation.
@aprosser35 @CllrKrisWilson Its a pleasure.
@aprosser35 @CllrKrisWilson What you advocate is important and I don't object, but development needs balance and the right infrastructure.
@aprosser35 @CllrKrisWilson I am not anti development, however we need a proper holistic balanced plan with the correct infrastructure.
Congratulations to @sajidjavid on his appointment as Sec of State for Culture Media and Sport. #Welldeserved
Delighted to join @ASDA staff in Nuneaton to celebrate the opening of the refurbished Nuneaton store.
From today businesses paying employers NI will see their bill cut by up to £2,000 to help them invest and take on new staff. #smallbusiness
From today no income tax until you earn £10,000.Since 2010 36,000 #Nuneaton people seen income tax cut - over 4,000 now pay no income tax.
2/2 Hardworking people will now be able to keep more of their own money to spend how they choose. #taxcut #forhardworkingpeople
Under Labour people earning over £6,500 paid income tax. From today people will pay no income tax on first £10,000 of their earnings. 1/2
@Aimetu @PGColledge Will look out to see if the Back Bench Business Committee grant a debate on this important issue. If so- I will attend.
@JeffMorArbury Thanks Jeff.
@annakatinkaholz I know. Those running @NBBCouncil  seem intent on making political decisions to the detriment of local people.
@khopkinsmp Thanks mate.
@annakatinkaholz 2/2 make traffic in Nuneaton and on the Long Shoot better. When there are accidents at that junction Long Shoot gridlocked.
@annakatinkaholz I appreciate the inconvenience. Well paid jobs being created on the MIRA site. The A14/M1 junction upgrade should help 1/2
@aprosser35 Generally because it becomes less attractive for people to avoid paying the right tax. Lot's also done to tackle tax avoidance.
@annakatinkaholz You are right there is likely to be disruption. The works are required to enable the MIRA Technology Park - 2,000 new jobs.
Well off paying £9bn more in tax after 50p rate cut to 45p - not the tax cut for millionaires that Labour predicted. http://t.co/vEaxfcswBf
http://t.co/vEaxfcswBf
George Eliot Hospital #Nuneaton : only 1O cases C diff and no cases of MRSA in last year. 6 years ago - 242 cases C diff 15 MRSA. #progress
2/2 Now we need to know how much taxpayers money @NBBCouncil have spent trying to close @NNWEC disabled riding stables and why?
Delighted to hear that @NNWEC have been successful in court and @NBBCouncil are now backing down and negotiating a lease. 1/2
Delighted to support Jim Jarvis and @maehospice at tonight's charity fund raiser at the Co-Op Club #Nuneaton. #entertainment #goodcause

Attended a very poignant service at St Peter's #GalleyCommon to celebrate how the community dealt with a mini-tornado. #Communityspirit
Pleased to celebrate Naw Ruz (New Year) with the #Nuneaton Bahai community. Happy Naw Ruz!
@ralphy1517 NHS funding has been increased in last 4 yrs. If you would like a proper chat please e-mail me. Marcus.jones.mp@parliament.uk
@everimarc I did support the play rangers when I was involved with the Council, regrettably I don't have any say over NBBC decisions.
Positive surgery at #KingEdwardCollege #Nuneaton now at my latest McDonalds community surgery.
@LittlehalesC Nuneaton and Bedworth BC are responsible for local planning decisions. We need a fair Borough Plan with public buy-in.
Great to see @George_Osborne in #Nuneaton today talking about his 2014 Budget. #LongTermEconomicPlan
Delighted that the Chancellor has scrapped VAT on fuel for Air Ambulances. The Midlands Air Ambulance will save thousands as a result.
@EwolbLowe I am now a Parliamentary Private Secretary in the Treasury, thus I was there to support the Chancellor. Back there in 20 minutes!
Good news for #Midlands businesses. Gov't employment allowance will give £2k off employers NI bill from April enabling more firms to recruit
Good Budget for #Midlands biz. Reduced energy costs,tax help and help with exports for manufacturers. #manufacturing #rebalancingoureconomy
Just read Labour leaflet for #Attleborough #Nuneaton. Amused to see candidate opposing houses on Gipsy Lane that Labour are supporting.
@MrspOppins2012 No - it applies to all but the highest earners.
Delighted to make a speech calling for more transparency in football club ownership. #CCFC #PUSB
@Strawface @ComeDineWithMe I would make a good participant myself, but alas I am too busy representing Nuneaton. I will retweet.
http://t.co/hc50LpoXtq
As part of our #LongTermEconomicPlan we are helping working people with up to £2,000 per child towards their Childcare costs. #childcare
Tough decisions by Gov't on deficit mean that we can help #hardworkingfamilies with 20% of their child care costs for each child.
Excellent news that new orders to #WestMidlands manufacturers are at a 16 year high. More orders=more people taking home a decent wage
Great news for #Midlands manufacturing as latest EEF shows strong manufacturing output and orders. http://t.co/2IFXwz0BxS #manufacturing
@Colwalt @raychwalton @ZoesPlaceCov Hope that it went well. Good luck with the run.
@greennuneaton @nadhimzahawi @danielbyles 2/2 scrapping beer duty escalator, 1.6 million new jobs. All policies for #hardworkingpeople
@greennuneaton @nadhimzahawi @danielbyles Raising the personal allowance to 10k, freezing fuel duty, keeping council tax low. 1/2
@crankshaw_lisa Very frustrating, I know, however it's important that the police thoroughly investigate such incidents.
@aprosser35 I agree, need more of the Virgin off-peak services. London Midland semi-fast services are good value, but need more seats.
Delighted to welcome the Secretary of State for Transport to Nuneaton to discuss the A5, NUCKLE and other rail issues. #positivevisit
@PetarBalac 2/2 After the changes we will still have one of the biggest budgets for legal aid in Europe.
@PetarBalac unfortunately a lot of changes are being made that might not chose to make, but we also have a massive deficit to tackle. 1/2
@nuneatonmems There is a wall between the pavement and the stable block behind which are the grave stones of the various dogs they had.
@nuneatonmems #nuneaton I lived in Trinity Walk, once part of the garden to the Hall. The stable block of the Hall is still there.
I hear that yet again Labour Cllr's on NBBC have passed another planning application against local wishes. #Arbury #Nuneaton #sameoldlabour
Positive news from the @fsb_hq that business confidence is high, more businesses plan to grow, invest and export. #longtermeconomicplan
Vote Conservative - get a referendum on the EU. Vote UKIP - get Labour and no referendum. #LetBritainDecide
@nuneatonmems I remember it well and Williams Furniture. I vaguely remember a newspaper story when it was removed - not sure where it went
@Mark_Aldrich @JDRFUK I was on hand to support this important cause.
@nuneatonmems  Not sure. I was raised in a pram in the back of my mums record shop in Heron Way - opposite the International supermarket.
No EU referendum from Labour - they obviously don't trust the people of our great nation. #LetBritainDecide
@cpttamworth Sorry Craig I was working. Good result though!
@MillieHainge #CountMeIn It was a pleasure, good to meet you again. #bravegirl
New apprentices give a £2.4m boost to businesses in #Nuneaton. I’m urging more businesses to take on an apprentice http://t.co/leoM42wbRz
Pleased to be supporting Millie’s Westminster mission tomorrow to raise awareness of Type 1 diabetes #CountMeIn http://t.co/m02MpRh7UM

Great morning discussing the varied and wide ranging campaigns of students at @hartshillschool . #Welldone
@greennuneaton I am not surprised. How Labour treat #Nuneaton people is absolutely shocking. #Complacency #Contempt  #letdownbyLabour
Strong manufacturing growth in February and a sharp rise in job creation. Great news for many families in the Midlands. #madeinbritain
@aprosser35 due to extenuating circumstances now meeting Hartshill youngsters next week. Getting more women into politics v important.
Looking forward to meeting students and answering their questions at @hartshillschool this morning.
#Nuneaton market re-opens today after the recent poor weather. #shoplocal

Just asked the Sec of State for Transport in the HOC about improving resilience on the West Coast Mainline. #Nuneaton #WCML
@LordAshcroft Exactly the right thing to do. I am working with @VeteransCP in #Nuneaton to encourage employers to give veterans a chance.
@NNWEC Thank you for the update - let's hope you are up and running as soon as is practicable. If you need any help, please let me know.
@Slytherinshare please can you send me an e-mail and I will certainly see if there is anything that I can do to help. Best wishes, Marcus

@greennuneaton I hope you never have a condition which threatens your eye sight.
@ChrisP_NN @MattDavies_NN @NuneatonNews Best of luck Chris. Thank you for your contribution to Nuneaton Matt.
@karlmccartney @JonCollett @Official_NTFC @LincolnCity_FC Karl you are a true sportsman. Its great to see the Boro doing so well this season
Agreed. #Arbury & S'Ford deserves a high quality high performing secondary school. This should provide a high quality learning environment.
@bobby_bridge real shame you can't find somewhere with 'facilities'. Can you send me a copy of your e-mail?
@THENUNEATONFOX I appreciate the disruption that has been caused. It should be finished soon.
@bobby_bridge They have a new head - has he been approached?
Excellent visit this morning to debate with students at #TheNuneatonAcademy. Great to see the £10m school re-build/re-furb taking shape.
Very positive day. Surgery and then campaigning with a hardy bunch who braved the cold wind in #Arley #Nuneaton .
@MattDavies_NN I hope that the time for Nun&Bed Swimming Club has been factored in.
@MattDavies_NN This is very sad. Labour Councillors have been trying to get rid of @NBLeisure since they created it.
Just asked the Sports Minister a question about protecting football referees following the recent assaults in the #Nuneaton Sunday League.
Just been to see people in #GalleyCommon who have been affected by the devastating tornado. So impressed by the fantastic community spirit.

After yesterday's awful storm in #GalleyCommon #Nuneaton if any local residents needs practical advice, help or support 1/2
Rack up huge deficit, oppose cuts to sort deficit, make lots of unfunded promises and then say we would run surplus#BallsJackanoryeconomics
Just spent a really enjoyable hour hearing how @Dare2DreamUK are helping young people 'NEETS' turn around their life aspirations.
Just caught a quick glimpse of Labour Lords trying to frustrate @jameswhartonmp  EU Referendum Bill. Why won't they #LetBritainDecide ??
Great visit to #Middlemarch Junior School in #Nuneaton. Some wonderful questions from year 5.
Congratulations to @1legscotty from #Nuneaton who has just rowed the Atlantic for @help4heroes . #Greatacheivement #Welldone
@Blaydon1 @DamonPBrown Check the facts - there has not been an official recession since 08/09. #ClearingUpLaboursMess
@Blaydon1 @DamonPBrown  We inherited an economy from Labour which had lost 7% off GDP and was running a deficit of £163 Billion.
@AndrewLabour Employment is at a record high since records began in 1971. Over 30 million people in work. 70% of jobs full time permanent.
Youth unemployment down, employment at record levels and inflation down. #LongTermEconomicPlan   2/2
We have seen best manufacturing growth in 20 years and largest fall in unemployment since 97'. 1/2
@SophvLee I would be delighted. What is Cpl Blaney's Twitter address? Can you also let me have the link to the fundraising page? Thanks
@jclements61 Down by nearly 21% in the last 12 months.
Unemployment in #Nuneaton down by 12.5% in the last 12 months and down by 28% since the General Election in May 2010.
Encouraging unemployment figures. There are now 719 less people unemployed in #Nuneaton than there were at the General Election in May 2010.
@SNCC_nuneaton I will try and mention it in my column.
@Ed_Miliband wants to spend more, cut nothing and says he can cut the deficit. Think he needs a new abacus. #SameOldLabour
Busy day! Surgery. Then collecting with Nuneaton Rotary. Now canvassing in St Nicolas ward #Nuneaton
@PetarBalac I agree its been tough for local government employees as well over the last few years. Be assured that I understand that.

@EwolbLowe Out asking peoples views.
Enjoying a fresh but bright January morning campaigning in #Weddington #Nuneaton
@ClaireH_NN These are abhorrent people. I am speaking to local police later today about these incidents. #sickpeople
Let's hope that Labour and Lib Dem Peers don't cynically stymie the @jameswhartonmp  EU Referendum Bill. #LetBritainDecide

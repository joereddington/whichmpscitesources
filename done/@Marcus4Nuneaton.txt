Great news that unemployment in #Nuneaton is now 58% lower than in 2010. More still to do, but good to see more people taking home a wage. Fri Apr 17 11:27:19 BST 2015
Teams out today campaigning and getting a positive response in #Attleborough and #Kingswood #Nuneaton. http://t.co/4UgoSCFq4y Thu Apr 16 22:23:39 BST 2015
Watching the Challengers Debate - it shows the absolute chaos if we had these people involved in running the country. #VoteConservative Thu Apr 16 21:14:01 BST 2015
@greennuneaton @Marcus4Nuneaton @BermudaBridgeAG I said nothing at the hustings other than expressing my opposition to the bridge project. Thu Apr 16 08:29:53 BST 2015
@mabwatjohnson @Victoria_Fowler @greennuneaton opposite the town hall. I think it is 7pm this Friday. Wed Apr 15 23:10:37 BST 2015
@mabwatjohnson @Victoria_Fowler @greennuneaton This Friday evening at the United Reform Church in Nuneaton. Wed Apr 15 23:00:48 BST 2015
@greennuneaton @BermudaBridgeAG I am opposed to the idea as I confirmed this afternoon. Wed Apr 15 22:59:08 BST 2015
@BattlefieldBen glad to hear that Ben. Wed Apr 15 22:31:22 BST 2015
Great day campaigning. Canvassing with Chris Grayling in #Abbey, @FSBWarksCov hustings, then a positive chat with #AnsleyCommon residents. Wed Apr 15 21:18:44 BST 2015
Great morning out in #Nuneaton town centre speaking to shoppers. Wed Apr 15 12:39:07 BST 2015
M6 near Coventry closed for 2nd time in 12hrs causing congestion in #Nuneaton that's why I am campaigning for safety improvements on the M6. Wed Apr 15 10:17:16 BST 2015
@nuneatonmasjid @Victoria_Fowler @greennuneaton @YouElect It was a pleasure. Wed Apr 15 07:43:05 BST 2015
@nuneatonmasjid good discussion, thank you for organising the event. Tue Apr 14 23:08:11 BST 2015
@thrualensbyliz @NuneatonMatters @Marcus4Nuneaton Was nice to see John. I knew that he could not have been in a gymkhana! Tue Apr 14 23:06:27 BST 2015
Delighted to see @Conservatives manifesto contains pledge to put #Nuneaton school funding increase into base budget for the next parliament. Tue Apr 14 13:40:59 BST 2015
Great day campaigning in #Nuneaton - three sessions in #Hartshill & #StNicolas. Thank you to @MarkPawsey @nadhimzahawi and @NuneatonMatters Mon Apr 13 20:39:31 BST 2015
@BBCAllegra In Miliband's conference speech he forgot to mention the deficit. Looks like its still an after thought #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 10:05:10 BST 2015
Because of a stronger econ we can increase NHS funding. This is how we're already delivering better deal for Nuneaton http://t.co/RxsFXPlsZb Mon Apr 13 10:00:53 BST 2015
Thanks to a good friend who has just put this up for me! #VoteConservative http://t.co/8dktMaDlBD Sun Apr 12 12:23:18 BST 2015
Thanks to a good friend who Sun Apr 12 12:15:10 BST 2015
@THENUNEATONFOX Not today! Sat Apr 11 18:01:05 BST 2015
In between canvassing sessions, I was delighted to attend the opening of #Ansley Cricket Club's new nets. #cricket http://t.co/VqQg5AsaAw Sat Apr 11 17:07:41 BST 2015
@NuneatonMatters Thank you to all of the @NuneatonMatters team for all your hard work. Today was an exceptional effort, as usual. Sat Apr 11 17:02:50 BST 2015
Really pleased with @Conservatives pledge to put extra £8bn a year into our NHS. We can only make this pledge because of the strong economy. Sat Apr 11 09:21:46 BST 2015
@abeehkr anything you want to ask, please don't hesitate to e-mail me. Fri Apr 10 22:01:28 BST 2015
@M0GKY manifesto out next week. We have frozen fuel duty for last 5yrs and stopped 20p per ltr in duty increases that Lab left in 2010. Fri Apr 10 11:43:44 BST 2015
We'll freeze rail fares for five years and save commuters £400

@Jeremy_Hunt Great to see you Jeremy. Thank you for supporting the staff at the Eliot and their continuing efforts to improve the hospital. Thu Apr 09 21:11:25 BST 2015
@THENUNEATONFOX Miliband wants to force #Nuneaton council and others into a merger with Birmingham. This is not localism its dictatorial. Wed Apr 08 22:46:20 BST 2015
@THENUNEATONFOX shame not the whole interview. I suggested that Miliband may want to consult Sturgeon and Salmond first on this policy. Wed Apr 08 22:43:38 BST 2015
Just interviewed by @bbcmtd about Labours top down devolution policy. Wonder if Miliband has consulted Sturgeon or Salmond for approval? Wed Apr 08 17:31:36 BST 2015
@EricPickles Thank you Eric for coming to listen to my concerns about the Borough Plan debacle that the Labour council are presiding over. Wed Apr 08 16:30:49 BST 2015
@martinangus yes - one that the Labour Party in #Nuneaton want to fill with houses against local wishes. Wed Apr 08 16:26:26 BST 2015
Great teams out today in Arbury and St Nicolas #Nuneaton and a positive response on the doorstep. #VoteConservative http://t.co/WfFKcGLAG4 Tue Apr 07 20:07:45 BST 2015
@spalatelu93 thank you for your help Stefan. Sat Apr 04 21:29:47 BST 2015
Thank you to @NuneatonMatters for a great day's campaigning in Arbury, Attleborough, Galley Common and Whitestone. Happy Easter. Sat Apr 04 16:44:09 BST 2015
Why do ITV not have a family from the Midlands discussing the leaders debates. Thu Apr 02 22:18:25 BST 2015
Competence of Cameron versus a coalition of absolute chaos. Vote Labour get SNP vote UKIP get the SNP. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:57:31 BST 2015
Miliband does not realise that we need strong businesses to employ people and create prosperity. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:51:05 BST 2015
Sturgeon : hope SNP MPs will keep Miliband honest. Looks like the SNP getting ready to control Miliband. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:42:22 BST 2015
Miliband at it again. There were more unqualified teachers under Labour than there are today. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:37:23 BST 2015
Cameron wise in helping Syrian people in their own region rather than bringing Syrians to the UK. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:22:58 BST 2015
After this Miliband will be glad that he did not get a head to head with Cameron. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:13:35 BST 2015
Great answer from DC. Realistic policy to reduce uncontrolled immigration from the EU. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 21:11:00 BST 2015
Labour had an open door immigration policy. Weak answer from Miliband. #Nochange Thu Apr 02 21:05:49 BST 2015
Miliband still trying to weponise the NHS and use the politics of fear with unfounded scaremongering. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:57:46 BST 2015
Sturgeon still dominating Miliband. This is frightening. SNP tail will be wagging the Labour dog. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:53:58 BST 2015
Anybody explained to Miliband  waiting times, waiting lists and ambulance response all worse in Wales where Lab in power.#voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:48:53 BST 2015
Cameron is right. The only party to cut the NHS in the UK is Labour in Wales despite them getting more money because funding up in England. Thu Apr 02 20:44:13 BST 2015
You can't have a strong NHS without a strong economy. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:42:44 BST 2015
Another u-turn from Farage - he wanted to turn the NHS into a private insurance based scheme before. Says one thing does another. Thu Apr 02 20:40:29 BST 2015
Sturgeon seems to be dominating all that Miliband says. Imagine a Lab Govt propped up by the SNP. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:33:28 BST 2015
Labour did vote for £30bn of cuts and won't say where they would fall. More taxes and borrowing. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:30:44 BST 2015
Miliband has spent that bankers bonus tax 12 times over. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:28:07 BST 2015
Labour : I am sorry there is no money left. Good luck! #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:25:40 BST 2015
Miliband not being straight. The Conservatives are raising more from the wealthiest in tax than Labour did when in power. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:20:14 BST 2015
Question 1 and only Cameron has an obvious plan to keep our economy on track with lower taxes. Others have no plan. #voteConservative Thu Apr 02 20:17:21 BST 2015
@mabwatjohnson Please do send me an email if you have any questions. Best wishes. Marcus@marcusjones.org.uk Thu Apr 02 15:56:53 BST 2015

@ConsultPotter Was able to do this today in the House of Commons. Thu Mar 26 17:33:19 GMT 2015
Humbled to ask a HOC question in memory of #Nuneaton youngster Georgie Hall who lost her battle with #meningitis. Hope we see MenB vac soon. Thu Mar 26 17:12:48 GMT 2015
@MartynFindley @NBBCouncil @Marcus4Nuneaton Not sure how it was organised. Wed Mar 18 18:09:54 GMT 2015
@NBBCouncil Can you confirm that the taxpayers of Nuneaton are not subsidising the delivery of Labour literature? http://t.co/YsyUMUFASY Wed Mar 18 17:48:24 GMT 2015
@NBBCouncil Please can you explain why a Labour Party leaflet was delivered inside the council's In-touch newspaper? Wed Mar 18 17:39:43 GMT 2015
@AndrewLabour That was under Labour when they called a course of a few months an apprenticeship. Sun Mar 15 12:17:03 GMT 2015
@rollins_will Yes - since I was eight years old. Sun Mar 15 12:16:08 GMT 2015
@theresecoffey We have such dedicated CF members. Thanks to them for supporting the campaign in Nuneaton. Fri Mar 13 08:42:31 GMT 2015
Enjoyed last night's @KECNuneaton awards evening. Performances from many talented music and drama students. #welldone Fri Mar 13 08:40:09 GMT 2015
Great visit to the @VeteransCP #Nuneaton with @Anna_SoubryMP who was very impressed with the support that the VCP give to our veterans. Mon Mar 09 10:59:46 GMT 2015

@Colin_Bloom @UK_CCF A great session listening to Nuneaton's Christian community. Thank you to Holy Trinity Attleborough for hosting us. Sat Feb 28 17:33:28 GMT 2015
Pleased that the Veterans Minister has just agreed in the Commons to visit the @VeteransCP #Nuneaton in March. Mon Feb 23 14:39:32 GMT 2015
Excellent response out canvassing in #Attleborough #Nuneaton today. Quite a few Labour voters having second thoughts. Sat Feb 21 19:35:13 GMT 2015
@AndrewLabour read the literature - it says that Labour want to freeze energy bills. #chaos Fri Feb 20 22:29:08 GMT 2015
Received a Labour leaflet. They want to freeze the energy bills of #Nuneaton people. Strange move when prices are falling! #Labourchaos Thu Feb 19 17:35:55 GMT 2015
@Stuart_MCFC @avfc_neale @LondonMidland Network Rail and London Midland are going to do an initial survey in the near future. Thu Feb 12 19:24:36 GMT 2015
@NWarksCops have been advocating this to Government to try and reduce the accidents between J4 -J2 which often cause gridlock in Nuneaton. Thu Feb 12 10:52:35 GMT 2015
@greennuneaton as I said at the Chamber of Commerce hustings last Friday. I have been working on this important issue. Mon Feb 09 17:43:37 GMT 2015
2/2 Miliband came and praised hospital so seems strange that his Labour candidate writes letters scaremongering people about our hospital. Sun Feb 08 09:11:02 GMT 2015
Really positive story on @skynews about patient safety at @GEHNHSnews . More to do, but it shows that we are on the right track. 1/2 Sun Feb 08 09:08:40 GMT 2015
@danielbyles @CllrPeterFowler both nationally and locally. Did you hear the car crash interview on BBC Cov&Warks at 9.08 this morning? Fri Feb 06 21:48:36 GMT 2015
@asabenn Nuns of Eaton would be unimpressed. As a former RC school pupil, don't think he will get too many Christmas cards from RC schools! Fri Feb 06 11:51:06 GMT 2015
@CllrKrisWilson its absolute chaos and contempt for the people of #Nuneaton. Could be so different if responsible Cllrs were running NBBC. Thu Feb 05 21:25:00 GMT 2015
@CllrKrisWilson that's appalling, every Councillor should have been able to debate and vote on such a fundamental decision. Thu Feb 05 21:19:17 GMT 2015
@CllrKrisWilson is that being referred for approval by all 34 Councillors or is it another 6 Cllr decision by Labour? Thu Feb 05 08:26:36 GMT 2015
@CllrKrisWilson they have nothing but contempt for local people. Wed Feb 04 21:54:30 GMT 2015
@haswell99 I wish you the very best of luck with your new business. Mon Feb 02 19:52:14 GMT 2015

@Mark_Aldrich 2/2 that we need for more emphasis on how the roads, school places, GPs etc are going to be provided in areas with new dev. Sun Feb 01 09:57:36 GMT 2015
@Mark_Aldrich If they already have planning permission, which they do, its impossible to stop this development. I agree that... 1/2 Sun Feb 01 09:55:21 GMT 2015

Early morning farewell to this amazing sight. How are we going to remember 1918 ? @PoppyLegion http://t.co/C0yJvC7nZ5
@BCBUAE @BBGOnline Thanks for remembering! Good luck with this and thanks for what you are doing for UK business abroad! @AlistairBurtMP

Proud to support our naval forces receiving thank you in Westminster Hall from the PM today @alistairburtMP http://t.co/MMGz4zqwtP
Warm tribute by PM Cameron to Linda Norgrove who gave her life for widows and orphans in Afghanistan.Proud of our aid workers and Forces.
@timgardiner @BBC3CR @iainlee Thank you. It's far from perfect but Afghani's I meet value the work done by extraordinary UK people 2001-14.
I continue to meet Afghans deeply grateful for our forces sacrifice, and for remarkable volunteers like Linda Norgrove. Think of them today.
Great IV with Damian Green MP in todays Times. Correct that UK better protected by EU Arrest Warrant, and on UKIPs nasty allies. #nodeal
@meolscop1978 As long as I've got it right that TU's now don't regard £140k salary as super rich- perhaps we have turned a corner on envy.
Don't get me wrong. No complaint about Len's rate for job pay. But not sure he conveys that he recognises this in others? #bbcqt
Don't get me wrong. No complaint with Len's salary- rate for job- just expect him to recognise this in others. Not too sure he conveys this.
Pain of stones in glass houses noted. As is that £140,000 is not super rich and is defended from the left. Will let Ed know. #bbcqt

Excellent and encouraging meeting with Palestinian delegation in Geneva who spoke of positive & continuing talks with Israel. @BGIPU
3. My letter to constituents who have already written in on Palestine debate is on my website- as I do for issues attracting much interest.
2.MPs like to know who constituents are. Cllr Biernis is up front but some choose anonymity. Email /letter contact much better all round.
1.The reason I don't use twitter for detailed responses to constituents is that some issues need more space for answer.
@BenHaddock83 You are very welcome. Complex issue still at the heart of the ME despite all the other dramatic changes in recent years.
@BenHaddock83 Thank you. As a constituent please email me-my details on my website- with your details so I can send you a full reply. AB
If you wrote to me you would find out. I don't use twitter for correspondence with constituents; other methods seem to work fine. Thanks.
@Bill16STN Once again that is your right and that of all my constituents and that's as it should be. Thank you for your interest.
@Bill16STN You have same rights as all my constituents to write, email and see me. Your preference for anonymous contact is your choice.

Great IV with David Flitcroft on 5Live. Honest and passionate about Bury FC progress. Good to see BBC interest in the Shakers.
@Bill16STN No. I am happy to respond to your query but reserve right to respond as to any other constituent via name and address. Thank you.
@Bill16STN No. I wish to reply in more than 140 characters. Upto you if you wish to write or attend an advice centre as offered before.
@bedfordramble @McNultyBrendan @papabilham @william_naylor @uglyhacker Thanks Charles. Always glad to support Rotary- thanks for all you do.
@Bill16STN Thank you for inquiry. As a constituent please write or email with address so I can respond fully. Contact details on website.
4.Our aim should be to govern well. In consequence we will win. Saying anything to keep the others out is where public feel we let them down
By elections 3. My comments not aimed at Grant but at assumption that public share main parties objective to keep the others out. You don't.
By-elections 2. Not sure people want to be told if they vote for one thing they get another. We can and should be positive of own message.
By elections 1. Important night not to be dismissed by main parties. Party banter losing its appeal to a public who want re-engagement.

@ITVEmmaH No Emma - already gone sorry
I wonder how small Carswell and Reckless feel after PM speech? Or does the bigger political picture ever prick the UKIP obsession? #Cameron
@JustAl58 Of course they are different but there's a link. And it's not the character of protest which defines events but the Govt response.
@JustAl58 I think Arab Spring is work in progress from N Africa to Gulf. It's not all about violent revolt but about evolution of governance
Arab Spring moves onto Hong Kong: It's not a lack of authority which brings people's protest- It's a lack of consent to their governance.
@JonBenja @tianran Just a taste of the Referendum to come. You thought Scotland was rough? Just wait- more of those comments to come.
Finally the J Redwood mask slips away with his threat to business which disagrees with him. I thought we were democrats? Surely misquoted?
@Panzerfrank Thanks. Appreciate your courtesy/comments. Issues trump personalities, but cannot be totally divorced from them. That's life!
@Panzerfrank I have no smart answer beyond you're right.
@Panzerfrank The disaster of coincidence. My tweet totally unrelated to Brooks. It's about UKIP sympathisers and the pain of their members.
@chris_underwood I'm sorry- absolutely unrelated to Brooks. I didn't know. Was for potential UKIPs- but I would rather we rally round.
If anymore MPs want to go, go now will you, and not cause this cynically calculated pain to the Party workers who got you to Parliament?
Great Track meet in Sandy. Fine day out for competitors and volunteers at first rate club @BiggleswadeAC http://t.co/SF7bkAvqSO
3. If Daesh was fuelled by Iraqi failures, so it was also by the atrocities of Assad in Syria. Must not lose sight of need to end conflict.
2. Do not underestimate Arab states confronting Daesh; profound statement against corrupt ideology/false claims to protect Sunni communities
1 I make 3 points in Commons: Daesh occupying land and minds; each needs confronted; legal force to end barbarity and challenging ideology.
Turning point in ME as regional states lead against IS. Chance of new drive for wider peace in Syria should also be taken. #Recall please
@NelsonEngland @ConHome Drivel. Hmm. Expected better from Chair of 7/7 Trust. Still- makes my point on abusing those with whom you disagree!
Shakers Shakers Top of the League Shakers Top of the League. Great result, celebrated everywhere. Except perhaps Bolton. But, hey?
Great result. Now the rest of the UK can show how it feels about Scotland by visiting it to say thanks. Lets make it a bumper tourism year!
@noboybands @buryfcofficial I support the excellent non-league teams in NE Beds as their MP, and a Bury lad follows the Shakers for life.
What a great speech from Gordon Brown just now-none of us any less Scots because we love the Union. Lets build a united UK from next 24hrs.
I don't see the Westminster elite fiction - just quiet proud Britons, all ages, colours and accents #bettertogether http://t.co/xWVAnmgH3Z

@peteenty62 The Waders did indeed make it through a well contested tie. A meeting with the high riding Shakers would be a dream game!
@Nozzell72 @ShippersUnbound No one discounts the need for theological/ideological undermining of IS.  This is already being Islamic led.
Beyond understandable reflex reaction to horror, a serious regional alliance is available in the region.Resolution and urgency justifiable.
And we need to be back in Parliament Monday for further briefing and to give clear authorisation for Government action. Enough debate.
UK Govt & Parliament should give backing to taking/supporting action against ISIL; wherever, whenever and for however long it takes. Now.

@fdaoulb Yes of course. The ME already has the values needed to win hearts and minds for the future- they show up the poverty of those of IS
Commons debate. IS should be contained by an Alliance led from Middle East states, with us, then ultimately defeated by values and theology.
The death of Jim Dobbin MP is a sad loss of a good friend across the Commons. He will be mourned as a man of faith, principle and humanity.

Gaza cease fire good news- but surely no 'victory' until long term peace, security and final two state agreement for Israel and Palestine?
@EblaTranslation Thank you for kind comment. So important not to have agony of Syria forgotten amidst other tragedies in Middle East.
@Edwina_Currie @BBCRadio4 Thank you for comment. Sad Syria no longer on front pages- no solution so no longer newsworthy. Deserves better.
Excellent analysis by David Blair of how Assad is fooling all- essential reading. 200,000 dead and counting http://t.co/n3kLqHXg0V
On BBCRadio4 and 5Live today making point that Syrian conflict deaths stand at 100x Gaza or 1000x Nigerian girls seized. Assad deal? Really?

@SamWatt111 No! Am sorry for late goal- away win for Shakers would have been good. I suspect opponents may have more against me than Bury FC
@lehain OK- debate is on following today's poor public engagement. I'm hesitant the concept will catch on - but lets see what people think.
@lehain I am not convinced they add anything to previous Police Authority system, and have not caught public support. So worth examining.
While its not the most important issue right now- I hope UK Govt will re-examine nonsense PCC elections and scrap them. Good try but useless
My letter in @Independent 19/8 sums up my view of year since Syria vote in UK Parl. Syrians deserve better than Assad or IS @SyrCoalition
@dom4good @vicarofbaghdad @KingsArmsChurch Yes thank you. Sorry to miss tonight but glad to meet up with Andrew last week- what witness!

UK has consistently said settlements are obstacles to peace incl a UN vote. But MEPP cannot be one sided-it's about land and security.
Ceasefire in Gaza welcome. Now the job must be completed- a comprehensive MEPP. No justification for return to violence. @AlistairBurtMP
@Bill16STN @jonsnowC4 @Channel4News If I'm your MP why don't you come and see me? I'm not hard to find-choice is yours.
@OmarBaggili My point was to draw attention to the fact that children are dying in Iraq and Syria in greater numbers and are not news.
On Channel 4 news tonight re Gaza. Will try to cut through polarisation. Violence must stop unconditionally- but honest talks must follow.

Prince Turki al Faisal has it right. Those Israelis and Palestinians of courage should seize chance of peace. Call for MEPP now @haaretzcom
Revenge attacks on Palestinians from any Israeli source unacceptable. All escalations risk targeting the innocent - MEPP only answer.
Hamas new attacks from Gaza are wrong and not the answer to current crisis. Status quo won't hold. Despite all, it's vital to restart MEPP.

@sgeretz Some thought it would never happen. An Alliance of moderate Islamic Govts, supportive others and theological denunciation needed.

Told you- the dodgy penalty plan always works in a game like this! What an advert for football!
I wonder if dodgy penalties should be allowed just to set up an amazing fight back and add to the excitement? Oh hold on- there's one now!

@kamelhawwash Years of legal wrangling- more misery. Talks could produce Palestinian State and recognised Israel within a year. Better bet.
@paulaerwe No. Just saying that those who sit round table are best judges of deal to be done. Too many voices leave us where we have been.
@kamelhawwash Not surprised! We are at a tough stage. So both are negotiating publicly. Politely tell them to get back to it and do deal.
If perfect MEPP existed it would have settled years ago. It doesn't. It's  messy and compromised. They both know that. Just back them.
@kamelhawwash Sure you do. So lets allow P Abbas to be the judge of that not you or me. Unless you think we should all have a veto?
@paulaerwe So you've been at the talks then? You don't know and nor do I. Leave it to them but tell them both clock is ticking.
@paulaerwe No. Our job is to urge agreement and then back it. Each side possesses those who will never see it as fair- they cannot have veto
@kamelhawwash Again, not your shout. Leave Palestinians negotiation to Pres Abbas. I'm not sure you even want him to succeed.
@paulaerwe Not my shout. Why should you or me get in the way of what the parties agreed? If you truly want an end to this, support them.
@paulaerwe Mediator accepted by both parties. That's up to them, not us. Our job to support them both in getting to their agreement
@kamelhawwash Most of us know all the history on both sides. No answers there. Current talks best chance- press for both to keep at them.
@JohnEAustin No one truly knows the content of negotiations at this stage John. We need to urge both to keep at it-this period is crucial.
@NadineLumley No. It's not too late, but its been too long and time is running out. Support Palestinian and Israeli 2 state negotiators.
@benabyad Because BDS is not my policy, it's not the UK's policy, and I spoke about the urgent need to reach the negotiated 2state agreement

Meanwhile- Syria. Follow Lindsey Hilsum's key C4 dispatches. 3 years. If we cannot solve at least we should not forget. @lindseyhilsum
@peteenty62  Profoundly no. Look at backlash from PM's supporters. This has been done because its right. Values love and stability for all.
@IainDale Not our family Iain. You're right to draw attention to it, but follow Hazel Burt and Vicky Beeching and you will see a difference.

@DanHeley1 So good news we now going in right direction. Today's point not money. It's women and protection: Beds police already improving.
@DanHeley1 Being left with a disaster of an economy by the last Labour Govt played a part in all our public service issues. No going back.
@DanHeley1 @Heart976News 2 She points to practice changes being introduced, and changed focus.But reporting and data sharing issues imp too.
@DanHeley1 @Heart976News 1 It may be tempting always to say this, but the C Constables response does not use this as an excuse.
@MrsEboJones I understand that possibility, but the comparison with other forces methods of working worth a look. Sure Beds can rise to it.
Disappointing news about Bedfordshire Police and domestic violence. Will be discussing today what needs done and how soon. @AlistairBurtMP
@FShedden Hi. Decision appears to be judicial rather than Ministerial so I fear hands are tied. But he is coming up. RF will be in touch. AB

Discussion with Russian delegation at Geneva IPU.No meeting of minds over Ukraine but important to convey UK Parliament concerns. #IPU130
@peteenty62  Ha! Glad you liked it. Most people just want MPs to get on with their work. We stopped talking about schools when we were 12!
Could my colleagues stop this obsession with their schools? Get on with your jobs. It's not your fault you were not at Bury GS. Get over it.

The pride and the pain of a Kurdish father, whose child died in his arms- a victim of Saddam Hussein's gas. http://t.co/0nq4ABqfVq
@SuhailAlgosaibi I hope so. My point, however unpopular, is how you get to that position with one party so much stronger than the other?
WilliamHague right to blame Assad for Syrian talks failure. No surprise. Backed by Russia, Iran, Hizbollah- why negotiate? @foreignoffice
@peteenty62 He told me he played a charity match in Grimsby once and after was promised 'something for his trouble'. Turned out to be fish!
Tom Finney- a Northern hero, a gentleman to his laces. A fine legacy to players grand or humble. Thanks Tom. http://t.co/i5dXRZHEdu

At Little Barford Power Station to view result of £100m investment. Good long term planning. http://t.co/d6Xvq7fvMv
BBC website reports suspicion growing that Syrian chemical weapons deal was a 'shrewd ruse' to buy time and avert action. No, really? #fools
Speaking at CMEC tonight. No surprise that Syrian regime in strong position- chemical deal suited them, and allowed killing to go on.
With Richard Fuller MP at Bedford Hospital seeing CEO and Children's unit. Strong progress on paediatrics - good news.@bedfordhospital
Oh! I wonder if Baroness Morgan's outburst over losing her position  prompts a look back at Labour and public appointments? #own goal
At Luton Airport to look at passenger arrangements. Do they queue on stairs too long and too often? What do people think? @AlistairBurtMP
@MartinHumbersto You have point. I am in touch with EA in our region to set out their dredging policy. Will get that out to local papers.
At launch of British Influence scorecard in the EU, hearing where our influence is strong and where we can do more. @britishinfluence.org
Fine debate in the Commons on Syrian refugees. Thoughtful response from HMG, targeting those most vulnerable for new help. @DFID_UK

I take it from the Regimes opening remarks that they have not come to discuss a transition of power. Reality check for difficulties to come.
Extraordinary to see Geneva conference live. Kerry got it right. Harder to hear Muallem talk of 'pure'Syrian state.
No easy path to peace.
Calling a game to support Boost Bingo campaign at Flutters Biggleswade. A safe, social, good night out! http://t.co/6GxuhXsP1z
@LorelyBurt My hologram turned out to be a bit of a surprise - but the hair was a nice touch. Lorely might sue! #Commonsoops
My point is that we may not be interested in portraits of our MPs but perhaps history will be. Do we not look at portraits of the past?
At BBC for World Tonight. Making case for democratic Syrian Opposition and need for support pre and post Geneva. @foreignoffice
Really silly lead story in Evening Standard. Portraits of MPs for posterity. Really the top story today? Syria? Europe? Fracking? Ridiculous
Good to see @BedsFireChief on BBCs Fake Britain. Excellent awareness raising on dangerous flammable furniture sold by leading retailers.
With Edward Peake Middle School Council , Biggleswade. Tough questions but the best lunch! http://t.co/K6NrfQqJg5
So sad about Paul Goggins. A decent, kind man, great values and commitment. The heart of a servant leader if ever I saw one. Will be missed.
Important meeting of all Beds and Luton MPs with Commissioner, Chief Constable and Police Minister to talk finance and innovation.
Waders may be off but have got to Wroxham FC v Needham Mkt here in Norfolk. Football eh? Happy New Year! http://t.co/H2UKbjksdy
@fionaunwin Stroke this afternoon. Being cared for in hospital, but serious I understand. Such a good man, and a friend since his CPAG days.
Deeply distressed at news of Paul Goggins MP who has many friends on all sides in Parliament. My family joins his in prayers for recovery.
Good news for 2014 lies in progress on ME peace process. Further release of prisoners by Israel is brave and right- maybe this is the year.
@MartinHumbersto @ hi Martin: EA claim locally they do dredge, and I've seen them do so. But I know some others are not convinced!
Dreadful Beirut murders emphasises that cycle of violence begun by Assad in Syria must end urgently. Lebanon must not suffer yet again.
5-1 for the Waders. Last gasp goal for a fine 2-2 Shakers fight back. What did I say earlier? Football. Nothing beats it. @Biggleswade1874
Heading for Waders v Bedford Town. Boxing Day Bedfordshire derby. Keeping eye on vital Shakers clash too. Football. You can't beat it.
@peteenty62 @TheICMP thanks Pete. An interesting role- will keep you posted. I remember Dave as a Queens Scout. Legend! Merry Xmas, Ali

Honoured to be new UK appointee to ICMP. Plight of the missing from conflict or other causes especially poignant this time of year @TheICMP

Photo of Obama and Castro great. Why are Cuba and USA at odds? Point? How many more pointless conflicts could be ended with Mandela spirit?
Privilege to make Commons tribute to Nelson Mandela. A legacy of reconciliation/ conflict avoidance would suit MENA region. @CommonsHansard
If there is a decent politician today who has neither been changed nor influenced by the example of Nelson Mandela I would be amazed.

Good Iran statement from FS Hague.  House welcoming but cautious urging verification, and end to Iranian part in Syria horror @foreignoffice
Israel's concerns understandable. Iran rhetoric and threats towards it must change. But there has to be a first, verifiable step like today.
Will do C4 news tonight on Iran deal. A welcome first step. Iran needs to uphold terms and change actions elsewhere ie Syria. @Channel4News
Excellent statement from PM on CHOGM, with huge attention paid to his visit to north in media spotlight. Right call to go. @foreignoffice
Labour is wrong on CHOGM. Clarity of PM and FS message, and focus on key difficult issues, is right and impacting strongly @foreignoffice
UK Govt decision to attend CHOGM vindicated by combining important C'wealth business and spotlight on Sri Lanka issues@Number10gov
Journalists should be able to work freely in Sri Lanka but no surprise they are hampered. UK Govt sense of spotlight on SL well founded.
Good statement from Wm Hague on Iran talks progress. But Iran must also address its role in terror, Syria and human rts. @CommonsHansard
An English town remembers. The people of Biggleswade out in large numbers under blue sky to say 'thank you' http://t.co/cxPrsAJYLG
@billneelyitv Which is why it's right that PM and Foreign Sec go to Sri Lanka, in CHOGM spotlight, where they can make just that point
@Biggleswade1874 Waders achievement in making history today just paving way for next year! We're proud of Chris and the club. Thank you.
Appears to be successful first round in Maldives. Vital next round not delayed if required- Maldives so close to affirmation of democracy.
@billneelyitv @Channel4 I'm sure there will be considered response. Sri Lanka Govt would be better advised to deal with underlying issues
Big day for Biggleswade Town FC. Good luck Waders - making constituency proud in 1st round FA Cup for first time. @Biggleswade1874
@Biggleswade1874 Big day for the Waders. Best of luck to all who have put the town on the football map and made Biggleswade proud. A Burt MP
All eyes on Maldives in a few hours. Free and fair elections would be welcomed as a release from shadows of the past for Maldivian people.
Just because a deal with Iran looked unlikely does not mean it can't or shouldn't happen. Detail before cheers or condemnation would be wise
Whoever decided to build Blackfriars station across the Thames is a genius. This view is from the platform! http://t.co/a3Zm4c976r

Commonwealth should uphold right of all accredited journalists to attend its CHOGM regardless of venue. If not, why not? @commonwealthsec
@MaldivesGrid @Ushfac Friends of Maldivian hard won democracy not interfering by supporting conclusion to a sovereign free election process
Important that Don McKinnon visits Maldives. CHOGM soon would welcome Maldivian democratic progress-if it is allowed to happen. But will it?

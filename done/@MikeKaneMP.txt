Labour will call a vote in Parliament by the end of the year on pay transparency calling on the Gvt to implement section 78 of Equality Act
Labour will require big companies to publish their pay gap so women will be able to see if they‚Äôre being paid less for doing equivalent work
Women today still earn just 80p for every male-earned pound, 44 years after Labour‚Äôs Barbara Castle passed the Equal Pay Act #EqualPayDay
Today is #EqualPayDay  this year women are working 3 days extra for free because of this Government‚Äôs failure on Equal Pay.
The next Labour Government will incentivise more businesses to pay the Living Wage with Make Work Pay contracts #LivingWageWeek
I am pleased to say that @wythenshawe_chg and @ManCityCouncil are both living wage employers #LivingWageWeek
The number of people paid less than the Living Wage has risen from 3.4 million to 4.9 million over the past four years #LivingWageWeek

151 foreign criminals released without consideration for deportation 2009-14 #PAC @ukhomeoffice
@ukhomeoffice don't know how many of those 'immigration offenders' are foreign criminals...they have no data and no idea what is going on
@ukhomeoffice doesn't know how many of these 'immigration offenders' are foreign criminals...they have no data and no idea what is going on
Outrageous use of taxpayers' money #PAC
Extraordinary - @ukhomeoffice paid out £5 million in compensation in 2013 alone to immigration offenders for delays in deportation process!!
@ukhomeoffice: around 700 foreign offenders who have completed their sentences being held in prison pending deportation. NAO:it's 1400 #PAC
mark sedwill - @ukhomeoffice - says it's cause foreign offenders' "circumstances can change" in prison - what circs? Not good enough #PAC
crazy that @ukhomeoffice don't start lengthy process of deporting foreign offenders until 18 months before removal date from prison #PAC
failure of home office to get better at removing foreign national offenders post-2006 scandal despite extra resources and powers just awful
V interesting session at 14:15. #PAC questioning Home Office on the removal of foreign offenders. http://t.co/Bf2FhndPTQ

@hselftax @CommonsPAC Thanks Heather - and thanks for your contribution #pactaxconf
Getting grip on tax avoidance requires a great deal of political will but state of our public finances makes it more important than ever
That means our govt must resist temptation to engage in race to the bottom on tax through devices like patent box relief #pactaxconf
No good countries signing up to @OECD tax standards in principle and then undercutting one another in practice #pactaxconf
Transparency just between tax authorities is not enough for citizens to have confidence #pactaxconf
We all, including multinationals, have a stake in the efficiency and delivery of public services and that requires people to pay their taxes
Great to have brought so many different stakeholders into one room- Some controversies but plenty of common ground to work with #pactaxconf
"If business becomes more unpopular than politicians then we really do have a problem"!!! - Justin King #pactaxconf
Current tax system encourages retail to move online. Drives down revenue from business rates. So public purse loses in that way too
"State should have no role in giving one company a competitive advantage over another"- Justin King #pactaxconf
Fantastic,thoughtful and measured speech fromJustin King former Sainsburys CEO - tax and fair competition two sides of same coin #pactaxconf
Justin King -"It is in the interests of our business, customers and shareholders" to comply with spirit as well as letter of tax law
"@CommonsPAC: .@GPerezinParis at end of day it is up to legislators to implement the rules they think best #pactaxconf" Very true.
Consensus across business, tax campaigners +academia that international tax system must change and soon. Politicians take note! #pactaxconf
Crazy to cut HMRC at a time when we need more than ever to focus on getting the money in. Will Morris, CBI, agrees #pactaxconf
We urgently need to simplify our tax system-@ICAEW tells us neither its members nor shockingly HMRC fully understand UK tax code #pactaxconf
Not convinced by argument that sharing info should be limited to tax authorities. Should be available to public. #pactaxconf
@RichardJMurphy "We have had the talk but now we need to see the action" #pactaxconf @OECDtax
Politicians who shy away from strong stance on tax avoidance for fear of seeming anti business should listen to CBI @CBItweets
Strong agreement on the issues between CBI and @OECDtax - it is nonsense to claim this agenda is anti business #pactaxconf
Will Morris from CBI- human rights has become embedded in corporate behaviour over last ten years- tax is next frontier @CBItweets
Grace Perez Navarro from @OECDtax -current rules date back to 1920s. World has changed and govts have to change with it #pactaxconf
Companies should not be able to choose whether they pay tax #pactaxconf
Thrilled to welcome MPs from around the world from Sweden and Tanzania to Switzerland and Hungary #pactaxconf @OECDtax @CommonsPAC
Today @CommonsPAC will be holding an international conference on tax avoidance kindly sponsored by @cityoflondon and @ICAEW with @OECDtax

Companies funded by UK taxpayer via PIDG depriving developing countries of tax receipts #DFID
Companies embroiled with PIDG looking more and more shady as hearing goes on....#DFID
Hard working taxpayers' money placed into hands of people who are involved in deliberately avoiding tax #DFID
#DFID PIDG trust administered by SG hambros, bank found by HMRC to have helped devise NT advisers' #taxavoidance schemes
Astounding that #DFID not consulting its country teams on the ground about PIDG projects, despite huge amount of taxpayers' money involved
#DFID failing in its duty to safeguard British taxpayers' money going into private sector companies
UK taxpayers' money should not be managed or distributed by companies motivated more by maximising profit than helping the poorest #DFID
Company running PIDG sold in 2013 to Harith which describes itself as a company specialising in 'maximising returns from risk capital' #DFID
Shocking lack of oversight and complacency by #DFID over £860m of UK taxpayers' money intended for world's poorest
ECP embroiled with James Ibori, former Nigerian state governor in prison for stealing nigerian taxpayers' money #DFID
Outrageous that #DFID unware of relationship between PIDG and Emerging Capital Partners, under investigaton by #SFO

Council tax revaluation you could do in a way that targets super rich eg properties over £5m owned by wealthy foreigners #LondonsFuture
I support hypothecation 4 NHS but Mans. tax will hit Londoners who are not rich,bought yrs ago+seen their homes rise in value#LondonsFuture
Questions about mansion tax. Personally I would rather see revaluation of council tax bands- still set at 1993 values #LondonsFuture
Mayor of London needs to do the same-but requires new levers eg powers to raise finance through property taxes @Demos #LondonsFuture

@leicesterliz passionate on why and how we need to personalise our public services. Great to hear a politician who really gets it #lab14
@leicesterliz Absolutely right that we must listen and address concerns about economic credibility, not just attack Tories #lab14
But without getting tougher on #taxavoidance and focus on getting the money in we start from a much weaker position @policynetwork #lab14
And we need an open and honest debate on the NHS- need is rising and we need a debate on what we fund and how eg hypothecated tax # lab14
We need to make radical choices eg spending less on tax credits/child benefit to fund child care @policynetwork #lab14

This would mean #taxpayer footing £300-400 million bill if Probation contracts terminated - appalling. What on earth was @MoJGovUK thinking?
HUGE pause from officials when asked if true that contract terms mean we are tied into paying #Probation contractors even if terminated
Fantastic phrase from civil servants on overpayments to work programme providers - payments "the dept would prefer not to have been made"!
Outgoing govt COO Stephen Kelly warns of 'car crash' from combination of more outsourcing and lack of govt skills. Are ministers listening?
@BlaenauGwentMP concerned misled by minister on floor of house. We want a written explanation and NAO to look at
Evidence from G4S/Serco shows they DID get more taxpayer funded work during period govt told us they were suspended. Was parliament misled?
Incentive for good behaviour only exists where there is proper competition which we simply do not have in a world dominated by G4S and Serco
@CBI_PublicServ CBI giving evidence to @CommonsPAC on contracting public services "Good behaviour = good business"- Quite.
#PAC finds that roll out of #smartmeters will cost  £215 per home but will only save 2% on average bill! http://t.co/JoEL30sSS4
@ICAEW Thanks for having me!
Fluffy answers on extent of hospitality depts receive from the top private companies they do business with. Must have full transparency.
MoJ needs to put in the public domain what went wrong on electronic tagging if we are to have confidence in the way govt contracts in future
Damning evidence of poor performance by G4S at HMP Oakwood- cut staff to cut costs eg of 'efficiency' at the expense of quality?
No rational person would do business with a company that cheated so why does govt?? Because they have let G4S; serco get too big to fail.
Serco says it would be prepared to publish performance information - will govt say the same?? We'll see.....
Serco categorically denies cheating on pathology contract. Hope that is correct @Independent
Govt gave clear impression there would be a ban on new contracts after tagging scandal. Now providers say that is not true. Extraordinary
G4S confirms ongoing investigations by SFO into 2 of their contracts with govt. Yet they say no ban from govt on bidding for new ones
G4S struggling to tell us what has actually changed since electronic tagging scandal
G4S £730m. Huge sums of taxpayers' money going to private companies
#Serco tell us they have a whopping £2.3bn of business with central + local govt a year

Off to Barking Mayor making with the brand new team and great vision in place. Good luck to the new leadership
If what I heard from Tories yesterday on tactical voting true, #newarkbyelection result not as bad for Labour as people making out
Hear from Tories labour voters in Newark voting Tory to  keep UKIP out!
Speaking in #QueensSpeech debate on #housing #immigration #transport in Barking
However pleased that govt will now limit excessive redundancy payments across the public sector, which PAC has criticised #QueensSpeech
Where is the transport infrastructure to unlock investment in affordable homes eg the 11,000 on Barking Riverside waiting to be built
Government rhetoric on housing has not been translated into homes on the ground and new measures look like drop in ocean #QueensSpeech
Nothing on NHS #QueensSpeech
Govt has done very little for the last year and appears to be doing nothing for the next year #QueensSpeech
http://t.co/acktCTIZBA A fantastic appointment  . Darren  has worked tirelessly to listen to and get results for residents in the Borough.

Absolutely outraged that Andrew Lansley has decided to close A&E and maternity services at King George Hospital.

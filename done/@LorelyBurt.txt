@davidpitt88 More than happy to visit Solihull Fire Station. Perhaps they/you would like to contact my office on 0121 706 9593 to arrange?
@davidpitt88 Yes but they are not in government
@SaileshPyPatel No problem - I believe in freedom of speech after all!
@davidpitt88 PPS to Danny Alexander & Deputy Chief Whip - only backbenchers allowed to sign EDMs I'm afraid
@davidpitt88 Unfortunately no matter what my views may be on any subject I cannot sign EDMs because of my government role
@SaileshPyPatel No. It's right to ban people if they incite violence. This is not about censorship, it's about safety.

@Skeptical_John ISIL are an insult to Islam which is a peaceful religion. That's all I will say on the matter.
@mrhig I disagree. Plan includes new political settlement in Iraq and  acknowledgement of realistic time frame.
@rougeforever When there are no good options you have to try to pick the least bad. Horrible decision to have to make.
@Bidermann41 I don't have a crystal ball on this but clearly the Iraqi Govt will have to accept a more pluralist state than under Maliki
@Bidermann41 You're right Keith but it must be Iraqi Army & Peshmerga - not British Army this time
I respect your principled stand @julianhuppert - only with a heavy heart did I support action this time against urgent threat of #ISIL
With heavy heart have voted to support airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq - but only political solution will bring final victory
@chrisccoulson A very grave decision but this time with regret I feel we have no choice but to support democratic Iraqi Govt defeat killers
ISIL murdered & raped thousands & plotting to attack UK. Britain invited by a sovereign govt to help defeat ISIL & will answer that call.
The division bell rings... and it's time to vote on UK military action against #ISIL

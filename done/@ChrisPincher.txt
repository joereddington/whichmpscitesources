Excellent #ExportWeek Conference at @Draytonmanor today. Thanks esp to @Cllrp James Hinton of @StaffordshireCC and @UKTI for all their help.
@LichTamChamber @UKTI Our export events begins this morning at @DraytonManHotel at 7am http://t.co/QUc15LM33Z
Finished doorstep surveying in Lakeside with @Simon4Belgrave - Good feedback in Lagonda/Jowitt. Now for a Shenstone curry with David Smith
Off to Hopwas to deliver letter on my next village surgery at the Social Club.
@leekelly1989 fine call up tomorrow and we'll settle on a time to talk by phone. I can't see my diary right now.
@leekelly1989 give my office a call in 01827 312778 and we can set up a surgery appointment.
Good news that Tamworth unemployment has fallen yet again - 672 lower than this time last year. Only 1% now on JSA. Still much to do though.

@themercyband I think 140 characters isn't going to be enough to explain the detail. But essentially we need a majority to pass the law.
Just returned from a moving commemoration of centenary of WW1 at Westminster Abbey. Wreaths at the tomb of Unknown Warrior #LestWeForget
@themercyband simply because Lab and the Lib Dems blocked the legislation. We need a majority to get a referendum & we don't have one - yet
Lest we forget this Remembrance Day http://t.co/DKxnOh8xT8
@themercyband Brown ratified Lisbon Treaty before he left office so couldn't have a ref on it. This is different. UKIP scoring 16% = no maj
@DanielleHM47 I don't sign EDMs as I don't think they have any effect. But I do write to ministers - as am doing in this case.
@themercyband Lib Dems scuppered our Referendum Bill two weeks ago - we don't have a majority in Commons to pass it. Solution? Con majority.
@karlsmith8511 I sent you a full letter, signing it on Friday, so you should have it today I would think.
@karlsmith8511 in fact I think you should have a letter from me now or shortly.
@karlsmith8511 sorry I don't sign EDMs but am happy to take up specific issues with ministers - as I have on issues like this. Email me.
Many thanks to @WhitbyAJ for laying my #RemembanceSunday wreath for me at Fazeley War Memorial this morning.
I will be at St Editha's church At 11am to honour our war dead and then later this pm at Prince of Wales, Wilnecote #WeWiilRememberThem
Off to my village surgery in Shenstone library shortly then over to Dosthill to doorstep issue survey.
At my regular Friday surgery at the Phil Dix Centre. Awful weather outside.
@michael70252096 120 chars is not enough for a response. I only have a previous "thank you" tweet from you. Please email me 4 full response
@ScottyTu sorry I don't sign EDMs.
@ScottyTu difficult to respond fully with 140 chars but if you email you will get full responses. And I meet local firefighters each yr
With ratings like these Conservative MPs will be queuing up to invite @Ed_Miliband to visit our constituencies!

Good to be out earlier with @Simon4Belgrave Danny Cook & our great Wilnecote ward candidate Roy Rogers canvassing in Hockley. Good response.
EdM's "plan" for senate is a wriggle to avoid question of Scots MPs voting on English laws + means more professional unpop. Lab politicians
@AlvecoteWood @savehopwaswoods @tamworthherald "we have asked SCC to withdraw Hopwas Woods proposal from the Minerals Local Plan.." Gd news
Just got news from LaFarge Tarmac- they are withdrawing Hopwas Wood from Mineral Plan. People power works! @savehopwaswoods @tamworthherald
I raised threat to Hopwas Wood in House of Commons telling William Hague people are "outraged" at LaFarge Tarmac proposals @savehopwaswoods
@caspbird thanks
Pleased to be interviewed on @101TouchFM on a range of issues - Hopwas Wood, Good Hope, HS2, Robert Peel hospital and Priory Park kart track

@ade6593 as I've always said when I've visited fire station in Marlborough Way by all means lobby, and negotiate, but striking helps no one
@Richfburep you know my view Rich - on the several occasions we've met at the fire station. It does not help that you're striking.
@drlukeevans @DHansenLuke Very pleased to support Douglas and his Con Future team #WorkingForWalsall today. Loads of campaigners in town
Just back from my Stonnall village surgery with County Councillor David Smith. Lots of local issues to sort out.
2/2 but please also ensure you object direct to county planning address planning@staffordshire.gov.uk or on county website consultation page
Lots of people signing up to object to Hopwas Wood quarry on my website - http://t.co/dOmoEoxrTz I'll pass them directly to County Ldr. 1/2
All please follow @savehopwaswoods >>> @Cllrp @MickGreatorex @MichaelOates5 @Allan_Lunn @tina4wilnecote @Joy4Belgrave @Simon4Belgrave
will do. All please follow @savehopwaswoods @Cllrp @MickGreatorex @MichaelOates5
@AlvecoteWood @savehopwaswoods no problem. I will send all objections on to the County but I encourage all to object direct to County too.
@kevin57carter I've written to County opposing proposals & have just delivered a survey to Hopwas. Email your details, will keep u informed
Just delivered surveys in Hopwas on unacceptable proposals to quarry Woods. Now off to raise concerns about Good Hope changes with managers
V concerned at proposals for quarrying in Hopwas Wood. I've written to County objecting in strong terms. Contact me if you'd like to do same
@Cocoonfxmedia mail me and I'll send you all the details. Not in office right now.
@Cocoonfxmedia see my comments in the Herald. I've objected to the County. You should do same and email me.
@AMMorrisMP Thanks Anne Marie
@JohnHambidge John send me your specific concerns by email or letter and I'll respond. 140 are characters not quite  enough.
Met with Jeremy Hunt this pm to discuss proposed service changes at both Robert Peel and Good Hope hospitals.
@taxi2425rover @tcatory they certainly report serious crime (judging by the letters and emails I get) and much of that is falling too.

Lots of excited kids (and parents) racing in the Castle Grounds at @kidsrunfree event this morning. Will be a weekly event so get involved.
@arrundell_m Parl Act can only be used after a "second refusal" by Lords ie this time if they block . Think we need reasonable debate time
@arrundell_m its for a 2017 referendum - a resubmission of last year's Bill blocked in Lords. If Lords block it again we can use Parl Act
I'm off to the Kids Run Free charity race in the Castle Grounds at 9am. Should be fun, despite the weather, so come along. @kidsrunfree
Yesterday in Parliament I voted for an in/out EU referendum to give people a say. Labour spent 3 hours attacking Bill then abstained. #weak
Great evening at St Editha's church #Tamworth listening to Philip Scrivens play the Grade 1 listed organ.
Just finished my surgery at the Phil Dix centre. Now off to a music recital at St Editha's.
@pmbbiggsy what happened was Lab put Treaty on Statute Book without asking anyone making subsequent vote pointless - we made that point then
@pmbbiggsy sorry that's wrong. Bill was tried last year too - but was blocked by Lab/Lib Dem Lords. Only Cons can AND will offer referendum
In HoC for debate on a referendum on the #EU. Succession of Labour MPs offering increasingly lame reasons why Britons should not have a say.
Enjoyed meeting @LFATvision Landau Forte sixth formers from Tamworth on tour and talk about HoC today.
Thanks to @WilliamJHague for speaking at my Campaign Club launch last night. http://t.co/RR0KxXNFDz
In the Modern Slavery Bill Committee most of today. Should finish around 5pm.

@BBCNews wrong to report #CPC14 promise to scrap HR Act in favour of new Bill of Rights is reaction to UKIP. It was our policy in 2010.

@jonahsend fine by me - as long as you don't think you're wasting your time (pace your previous tweet)
Looks as though the sun will shine for @craig4nwarks and @KarenMercerWest wedding in Aviemore this afternoon.
@jonahsend fair enough. But you'll just have to put up with my tweets I'm afraid.
@JHallHDI @craig4nwarks @KarenMercerWest sadly I only have a beanie hat!
Maybe David Suchet could reprise Poirot with The Mystery Of The Missing #Miliband Deficit? But who did it? Brown? Balls? The butler??
Norman Smith on @BBCRadio4 nails EdMil speech - people are looking for Labour reassurance on the economy - but they didn't get it.
EdMil began his conference saying it's all about economy. Yet at the end he failed to mention it. Core credibility problem. #LabourFail
@LabourEoin then why are you quoting other historical stats if you're only interested in latest data? Inconsistent. Sorry. Early start tom.
@LabourEoin And the deficit? You're not going to admit it's reduced since 2010 so no further point in asking. Like Ed M. Thanks anyway
@LabourEoin no it isn't an answer. You just don't want to say it has been cut significantly since 2010. But you know it has.
@LabourEoin Not answering the deficit question then? Rather like Ed M.
@ClairUnderwood1 Will do Claire. Thanks for all your local healthcare work.
@LabourEoin just remind me what the deficit was in 2010 and how much it has been reduced since then? Even Ed Balls is admitting it now.
@chrisshipitv @craig4nwarks @KarenMercerWest A good, and sobering, point!
Off to Scotland tomorrow to join @craig4nwarks & @KarenMercerWest for their wedding. Told by a guy on phone from Glasgow to "pack a jumper"!
@jonahsend I offered you the chance to sign up to my regular emails - but we haven't heard from you.
Ed Miliband "forgot" to mention the deficit in his speech. But UK hasn't forgotten who caused it. Amazing omission. Lab still don't get it
EdMil admitting he's not prepared to stand up 4 Britain in Europe nor 4 England & fairness within our Union. He'll stand up 4 Lab though...
@davidtorrance biographers must know their subject? So that's why Jenkins on Asquith, McKinstry on Rosebery, Starkey on Elizabeth I so poor?
Busy day in the office with lots of focus on constituent issues and planning November export event.
@jonahsend how do I "run" our constituency? Borough Council/County Council provide most services. Email me & I'll add you to my update list

Overwhelming Conservative support on fulfilling vows to Scotland, resolving #WestLothianQuestion for England/Wales & restating our Union.
Usually uber loyal Ben Bradshaw now bashing #EdMiliband for failing to address #WestLothianQuestion. Only Conservatives serious about #EV4EL
@BradleyScottWin good luck
A few Labour MPs get the need to solve #WestLothianQuestion but their leadership (and wannabe leaders) do not. They want same old unfairness
@toni_pearce @HouseofTwits it's not about "understanding" but about being responsible 2 your constituents 4 your votes. Lab don't get that
1997-2010: Labour had the time, money & majorities to address #WestLothianQuestion. They failed. We need fairness for England #englishvotes
Will be at the Battle of Britain service at St Editha's Tamworth later this am remembering all who fought for our freedom - and still do

PM right that we must build a new settlement for all the United Kingdom- we need one that binds us all together again for all time #indyref
Sail on, o ship of state; sail on o Union, strong and great....
Salmond certainly has chutzpah. Talks of 1.6m who voted for independence. Fair enough but not about 2m who didn't. Not a man to unite Scots.
As Scotland votes for Union we must start to rebuild it & heal divisions of the debate. Alex Salmond must question whether he can do that.
@LabourEoin @MBarrettCH then you should have been with solid Lab campaigners in Harwick working with Conservatives to preserve the Union.
Striking result for #bettertogether in Western Isles. I was told 2 wks ago by SNP at Wminster that it "was in the bag". Must have jumped out
Back in Tamworth but have been calling friends in #Hawick to GOTV for #BetterTogerther - let's make our Union stronger not weaker #indyref

@SchmidtMuzik I'm saying, & I reckon you know this just as Alex Salmond does, that BoE is accountable to UK Plment but not ind Scots Plment
@jimthetim8 I accept that you don't. But the majority of Scots do want to be in the UK - unless all the polls are lying. #bettertogether
@SchmidtMuzik I fear you're wrong - overwhelming economic opinion (not political opinion) is if BoE controls rates there's no Scots £
Strong finish from #Alistairdarling making clear the Union is better together. Alex Salmond still won't/can't answer currency Q #indyref
@CllrDave4Gornal very sad that you choose to politicise a joint campaign to preserve the union. And I suspect your boss will agree.

Proposed split HoC Clerk job muddies waters. Who makes decision? What will roles be? Cost of 2 to taxpayer? Etc. Need debate b4 appointment

@smoothflowpaul suggest you re read my last tweet. But if you want full response email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk with yr details
@smoothflowpaul I don't think tackling Hamas which hurts civilians is right but Israel has every right to defend itself against attacks.
@smoothflowpaul so it's not so bad 2 fire rockets that don't kill? R's fired into Israel 4 years killing/injuring. Must stop or be stopped
@smoothflowpaul Then read govts stance as reported in Tgraph 2 days ago and make clear you oppose Hamas rockets falling on Israeli kids too
@smoothflowpaul that is an appalling thing to say. Govt and UN have called for a unconditional halt. I take it you also demand Hamas stops?
@smoothflowpaul are you blaming the British government for the Israeli actions, the Hamas rockets or both?
Will shortly chair x4 sessions between #HS2's Sir David Higgins and local communities affected by route. Hope for constructive #HS2 feedback

@truemagic68 indeed I agree. And I guess anyone of them would be embarrassed by #edmiliband performance!
On health in #PMQs #Ed Miliband is about as useful as a Brazilian goalie! #Labourfail
In Energy Select Committee looking at small nuclear power and small reactors.
Great day at the Elford ale festival yesterday afternoon. The walled garden is looking especially good http://t.co/pVsZnOcVnw
@RSaltLeeds @cjpearson82 I do indeed Richard.
Now at Elford ale festival. Sun is out which should aid sales!
Off to my village surgery in Clifton Campville later this morning
@RSaltLeeds @cjpearson82 thanks for the ff
@ben437 lights rephased 2 yrs ago/new S.bury's exit built last year. Email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk with details - I'll check
@garyjondavis @grumpyoldstan FYI still waiting a response from County on flooding around arches - but I think they have done some work.
Just at the Glascote Heath Primary School Farm. A great new facility for local kids in Glascote @tamworthherald
Now in Energy Select Committee looking at network issues and charges
@Petrichor_exe employment means skills building, experience and confidence. Low pay commission has proposed min wage inc + many jobs skilled
Spoke in welfare debate tonight focusing on importance of getting people back to work as est way out of dependency - something Lab avoided.
Listen to my interview on @bbcwm this am on the EU and Jean-Claude Juncker http://t.co/A1buXrg2VA (scroll 2hrs 20mins)
The party is really getting going at  @FOXCancerCentre this pm. Crowds of people here to launch new centre in Craven http://t.co/3V3JDU9WcO
Off to see the new Sharon Fox Centre in Craven, Stonydelph. Looks like there's a big turnout @FOXCancerCentre
@Therapod1 @sunpoliticsmids @bbcmtd by not having to suffer a £38b black hole in its budget - which affected kit and demands on people.
@FOXCancerCentre @LeeStephenBates will be joining Sharon and her team at her new centre at around 1.30pm.
Really enjoyed Amington fete earlier this afternoon. But a pity Greysbrooke primary school garden party was cancelled due to weather.
On #ArmedForcesDay today we should all say thanks to those that serve this country to keep it safe from harm.
Labour criticise @David_Cameron for not stopping #Juncker - but they wouldn't have tried at all. Only Conservatives can & will stand up 4 GB
About to kick off my regular Friday surgery - rain has finally stopped and the sun is shining.
Off to visit Sir Robert Peel hospital shortly meeting patients and staff.
Great to see 3 Battalion @MercianRegiment homecoming parade through #Tamworth this am. Town very proud of them all. http://t.co/V8xBD2UXdp
Off to speak to the Association of Conservative Peers to tell them about what are the major issues this week in the Commons.
Appearing on @sunpoliticsmids supporting @MercianRegiment as they march through #Tamworth tomorrow after their Afghan tour .
@JimTrood real but misleading. Time stamp is 8.20pm - we vote at 10pm so chamber fills up again from 9pm. & you're looking at Oppos benches!
Spoke in energy debate in HoC last night calling for more competition, easier switching and fewer tariffs to drive down consumer bills.
Bad news for Labour this morning - 43% of Lab voters think #EdMiliband should be sacked. Meanwhile Alan Johnson/Peter Mandelson pile in too.
@Andrew4Pendle Prayer card in reserving seat for PMQs, e-mails sorted, papers read, off to give a tour >> you're forgetting beans on toast!
@AlunCairns: @nick__bourne Latest bid is 1925 to 1929. Full credit to ChrisPincher >> I should get a life!!
Pleased to back mandatory jail terms for knife possession in HoC today.
Excellent service for Mayor @RichKingstone (great sermon from Vic Van Den Bergh @VictheVicar) & Mayor speech at Bolehall Swifts #tamworth
In economy debate @edballsmp fails to clearly rule out Lab plans for #jobstax now or at GE. Lab still threatens jobs #LongTermEconomicPlan
@Richfburep sorry but I'm in Westminster today as Parliament is sitting.
Just spoke in Queen's Speech debate on jobs. Tamworth jobs figures today show lowest unemployment in yrs. Good news #LongTermEconomicPlan
Out and about meeting residents in Sunset Close. Off to London shortly.
@MartinSummers seems odd unless there are legal issues.
Congratulations to@RichKingstone on becoming Mayor of #Tamworth @TamworthCouncil - you'll be a tremendous first citizen.
Filthy weather this morning. Hope rain clears up before the #Elford walled garden fundraiser at lunchtime
@Richfburep always happy to speak to ministers for my constituents- better to email rather than tweet: christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk
@jono_morgan @NickyMorgan01 the joke was very good. Really good evening and a lot of thanks from 130 supporters,
Great speech from @NickyMorgan01 at the Shenstone Fish & Chip supper tonight - with comedy entertainment from Johnny Coal @TamworthConserv
@jono_morgan @NickyMorgan01 make sure you get her to tell you ALL her jokes. >> both of them??
Looking forward to @TamworthConserv fish and chip supper with @NickyMorgan01 in Shenstone village hall tonight.
Out in Harlaston delivering my next village surgery invitations for 14 June with @Cllrp @HPoultney and @WhitbyAJ . Sunny lunchtime.
@ChrispLOL always pleased to welcome new supporters to the Conservative Party contributing to the v good result for Rob Jenrick
A sunny morning in Tamworth, remembering the morning 70 years ago and the bravery and sacrifice of the Normandy landings #DDay70
Remarkable that in a by election (where anything can happen) @RobertJenrick Conservative majority is bigger than entire Labour vote #Newark
Congratulations @RobertJenrick on being elected the new Conservative MP for #Newark. See you next week.
@ChrispLOL thanks for the advice Chris. Remind me, how'd Labour do?
If the polls are right Labour is going backwards in #Newark - a bad sign for them just 11 months before a general election.
Very helpful meeting with Health Minister Dan Poulter this morning discussing Sir Robert Peel hospital and Burton NHS Trust funding.
Just finishing last push GOTV for @RobertJenrick with @GregHands @Mike_Fabricant and @DLidington #newarkbyelection. Great sunny evening.
Now back in #Newark town for mid evening push for @RobertJenrick #newarkbyelection
#newarkbyelection just spoke with lady saying UKIP canvasser knocked door this am & shouted at her 4 not voting UKIP. Interesting technique!
Out in Lowdham with @DLidington and @James_Bird_ getting out the vote for @RobertJenrick
@ade6593 I think I am! You're better placed to tell! See Andrew Miller (Lab Ellesmere) speech on fracking going on right now. Nail on head.
@ade6593 fracking will take place 1000s of feet below ground (far deeper than coal mines). Care must be taken but don't buy the scare myths
#QueensSpeech Debate Ed Miliband continually refused to deny he may increase employer/employee NI contribs. A jobs tax will hurt growth.
Brilliant Loyal Address speech from @PennyMordauntMP and thumbs up from the PM - congratulations Penny.
Just returned from listening to Queen's Speech (& Skinner's "Loyal Joke"). Good news on tax cuts, shale gas/energy plans, tougher crime laws
@johnhadley07 you're right John - I disagree. It wouldn't be a British way of doing things but a Blair way of doing things. Slapdash.
EU needs a sensible President of the Commission who believes in real radical EU reform not a life long federalist offering more of the same.
Sad to learn of the death of #Tamworth former mayor Gerry Pinner.
Campaigning in Windsor Road with @Jesse_Norman @WhitbyAJ @HPoultney and David Ruffley for @RobertJenrick http://t.co/DTq2M45div
Driving up to #newarkbyelection to campaign for @RobertJenrick with @Jesse_Norman @WhitbyAJ and David Ruffley. Hope the M1 is clear!

@joyltom email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk or write to 23 Albert Rd Tamworth B79 7JS
@joyltom sorry been away. Afraid I don't sign EDMs -don't think they have any impact. But happy 2 write 2 ministers on constituents' behalf
And at 12.44am in the South East the Lib Dems break their duck...
@stellacreasy surely there's only one? Sion (predictive text switched off) will be texting to remind you!!
@ChrisPincher: Soon Simon is back in elected politics! >> by which I mean Sion Simon!
Congratulations to Philip Bradbourn and Anthea McIntyre on being returned as Conservative MEPs for the West Midlands.
Soon Simon is back in elected politics!
Jeremy Vine's @BBCElection coverage "heat map" graphic is a bit, er, naff.
East Midlands returning officer seems a bit unsure of his own returns.
@CCHQPress Labour running 3rd in Tamworth too.
Still waiting for the West Midlands Euro result. But some results declared eg Birmingham and #Tamworth
Am hearing Labour has come third in the Euro count in #Tamworth. More bad news for Labour if correct.
@tamworth_new thanks.
@tamworth_new sad to lose John Garner + also missing Stonydelph by just 27 votes. But pleased by Belgrave win + bigger vote share than 2012
@PatrickBurnsBBC @daily_politics Sunday Politics reports Lab had bad night in #tamworth. Too right. They lost a seat to us/won fewer votes
@grumpyoldstan I will contact County Council & water authority but need your contact details pls email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk
@ASLCoton cheers Alan
@VarleyNick thanks Nick
@owenlmeredith thanks Owen

@coady_tom @Kins96 @Conservatives yes John Garner is a good man and good Cllr. Sorry he lost. But our gain in Belgrave was by bigger margin
@bizmandan NP
@TheIslandsMP thanks Andrew
@bizmandan in fact Lab do not have one more seat. They have the same number as before. They failed to make headway.
@bizmandan Labour targeted to win Tamworth yet they lost a ward to Conservatives as well as gained one and polled fewer votes than Cons
@paulwaugh Well they would say that wouldn't they?? Rumour at count last night was he would be coming to Tamworth>>then we got the results
Plans for Ed Miliband to visit Tamworth this morning have, apparently, been cancelled.
Thank you @SkyNews for the correction http://t.co/JqqSDx8OOS
@lanerobertlane @skyelections 'bout time. Thanks for the info
@SkyNews Sky still reporting Tamworth gone to NOC. Not true. Conservatives retain controlling majority. 16 Con, 12 Lab, 1 Ind, 1 UKIP
Conservatives retain Tamworth - Labour beaten into third place by UKIP in three wards. Cons polled more votes than Labour. #labourfail
@SkyNewsBreak Sky is incorrectly reporting Conservatives have lost control of Tamworth. In fact we RETAIN control
2 more hours to keep council tax low in Tamworth. #VoteConservative #Tamworth #tamelections

@loisislane @TheLaughinPig @tcatory No problem Lois.
Out helping John Garner campaign in Amington. Sunny day in Tamworth @TamworthConserv
@loisislane @tcatory thanks Lois
@tcatory quite interesting to be lectured by a Labour chap who loves socialism so much that he moved to, er, America.
Danny Cook absolutely right 2 say Tamworth's Conservative council will keep council tax low-only party that can/will do so @sunpoliticsmids
Great sunny morning. Off to my Little Aston village surgery later then campaigning for @TamworthConserv candidates around the town.
@JimTrood yes it is Alastair Whitby. Leaflets are delivered by volunteers but most of area should be done by now.
Unemployment in Tamworth down to just 1.7%. Good news but we must continue to attract employers and jobs to our town #LongTermEconomicPlan
@Mike_Fabricant @wrgly How do you feel about Tamworth?” < I love Tamworth and I just adore @ChrisPincher. (THAT's ruined his career.) >>yep!
Minister @NickyMorgan01 beating up a very sheepish Labour front bench about job creation incentives in Finance Bill Committee #financebill
@johnhadley07 @Cllrp sorry for the delay. We'll see what happens but speaking to people on doorstep they think Con council has run town well
@loisislane thanks for contacting me. Best to email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk with your issue and full contact details.
@farmersonfilm @iCheeseAwards sorry I can't make that day as am away. Good luck.
Out campaigning for @RobertJenrick in Balderton. Sunny Day. People say they like Rob #newarkbyelection
Despite to April showers (in May) great day campaigning with @Cllrp and about 18 others in Stonydelph, Glascote & Amington. 12 days to go.
Weather looking a bit dicey but @TamworthConserv start campaigning across the town at 11am. Will be speaking to lots of people today.
@jettzworld all well. Been busy not tweeting!
Now in my regular Friday evening surgery. One no show so far. Will be delivering election leaflets again later.
Joined @anthea_mcintyre and @TamworthConserv team earlier delivering postal vote campaign letters across Tamworth. Sunny day
In Energy Select Committee inquiry on Green Deal in rural communities with Calor Gas Ltd @calornews and ACRE.
Lots of people helping @tina4wilnecote in Wilnecote today inc Danny Cook, @CllrAndrewJames Michelle Thurgood and @Alex4Tamworth. Grt weather
At @Draytonmanor meeting Colin Bryan. Park seems to be busy despite chilly start today.
@Richfburep happy to meet up with your team Richard. Sorry I didn't get your message last month.
Full day (almost) on the Finance Bill Committee. Interesting meeting earlier on developing 5 day turnaround on energy provider switching.
A bit late but see my HoC speech on #HS2 and the impact on my constituents here http://t.co/SagCHuZXaX (scroll to 7hrs 13mins 15 secs)
Just spoken in #HS2 debate on business case, mitigation and blight. Made clear I will vote against the Bill.
Still waiting to be called to speak in the #HS2 debate in HoC. Very large number of MPs looking to have their say.
Met with constituents concerned about #HS2 this afternoon as part of #NFU delegation. Now in Chamber awaiting debate.
Will be meeting local NFU members in London later ahead of #HS2 Bill debate.
Great 100 Club party this evening at Shenstone village hall.
Happy Easter to all.

Out in Stonydelph with @MichaelOates5 @AdamIWoollard and @HPoultney campaigning for Frank Worrall.
Tamworth unemployed down to 2% - a massive 730 in 12 months. Today just 968 claiming JSA. Gd news but no complacency #LongTermEconomicPlan
Unemployment now down to a five year low. Good news. http://t.co/ZmBtIvW7yb #LongTermEconomicPlan
Out canvassing in Sunset Close for @Allan_Lunn. Sunny weather in Tamworth. Thanks @AdamIWoollard @HPoultney for helping.
@inspirechild I think 140 characters a bit limiting to answer all your questions? Why don't you write or email me?
Good canvassing session today on Tamworth Road - lots of support for local candidate @Joy4Belgrave Joy Goodall. Thanks to all helpers.
@craigawoodhouse is it real gold, or chocolate? Congratulations.
@inspirechild raised constituents' concerns with council - but course must prove it can be financially viable as I'm sure you'll agree.
@emobag ok Kate
@emobag  Re Parliamentary Uni Group, I'm afraid I have another commitment tonight. Lots of APPGs so can't attend all their events I fear.
@Cocoonfxmedia @tamworthherald very odd (no pun intended)
@anitathetweeter True. Debussy can't compete with John Parr!
@anitathetweeter cert one of my favourites - went to Uni about that time so film has a resonance. But long time favourite flick = Dodsworth
See @GiselaStuart and me on @sunpoliticsmids today here http://t.co/2EB9ZcPWpY
@DerekWhitaker3 @sunpoliticsmids @bbcmtd 0/flexible hour contracts paid minimum wage set by LPC. Govt consulting to close any exploitation
Caroline Flint tells @afneil Lab want competition in energy. Good idea - but why do smaller providers say Lab policy will do the opposite?
Enjoyed relaunching Tamworth Conservatives Shenstone branch. 34 villagers in Richard Cooper rooms signing up to help. @TamworthConserv
@rosschawkins Tamworth people bemused most famous son shrink wrapped at Westminster. Jeanne-Claude/Christo homage? http://t.co/TpXglABM6d
@mthroup Congratulations Maggie!
@CharityUKNews @charlesmorganuk @NatMakepeace @DJPAULETTE @tina4wilnecote @DurhamScChief @Doug4Fazeley @999forrest @soldier_79 thanks for ff
@emobag evidence from Australia suggests will only make modest beneficial impact. May make smuggling easier. Need 2 see consultation outcome
Cleaner air for Tamworth and local villages tomorrow morning apparently. Thank you Atlantic weather front (not often you hear that!)
@inspirechild mail christopher.pincher.mp@parlyament.uk with your details as 140 chars not enough to answer Qs. Where are you teaching now?
In HoC #BQ asked for 2nd day to debate the #HS2 Bill at 2nd Reading and debate on Uni Technical Colleges including one for Midlands/Tamworth
@thetamevalley @tamworthherald @birminghammail @birminghampost @ColeshillPost we'll be delivering a £2.5m scheme in your area! >> Great news
In Energy Qs highlighted Lab plan to "freeze" bills will cut infrastructure investment they admit is needed = higher taxes & bills. Lab con.
@labourenergy if you want to freeze prices why did you back carbon target change in H of Lords adding £125 to bills? Govt had to stop you.
@inspirechild lots of different Qs. What do you think? I try 2 get round community/understand issues eg visited your school when you were HT
@inspirechild @LCWilkes Follow the work of @Tamcommunity a local charity encouraging healthy lifestyle knowledge for schools and families
Will be at the Parliamentary Group For Energy Studies this evening. Will see what industry, academics, consumer groups make of Budget
@maurice1941 Sorry but I don't think 73 years old gives you the right to be that abusive. Like I say, you betray who the real nasty party is
@LCWilkes Thanks Laura. Will pass message onto our local candidates in Tamworth
Spoke in Energy Debate - Labour's energy freeze con will cut investment/place burden on taxpayer. Need tariff reform/switching to cut bills
@maurice1941 The real nasty party speaks. Thanks for that.
@CarolineFlintMP @tauppen Always impressed you stay on Front Bench through debates. Said so to Jonathan Reynolds. To be copied where poss.
@tauppen @CarolineFlintMP you should have heard Caroline's continuous chuntering. No personal disrespect to her of course, just her views.
@Alex__Stevenson The Conservative back benches made the gold-QinetiQ point volubly to Ed M. Strangely he chose to ignore that.
@Alex__Stevenson he also forgot sale of the gold and QinetiQ. Seems Labour is in total amnesia mode and wants to forget its own record.
#PMQs Ed Miliband forgot privatising Royal Mail was Labour policy. Really bad performance from him today - ignored staff who now own shares
Read my HoC speech and minister's response on the Sir Robert Peel hospital here http://t.co/RhY0W4id8S & thanks to @agriffithsmp for support
V pleased Minister Dan Poulter paid tribute to @FOXCancerCentre in my Robert Peel hospital debate (scroll 08.50.15) http://t.co/X53wgWJ2F8
@bluenose_carl seems to "come naturally" to BBC, Sky News, TotalPolitics, Independent...and Len McCluskey. Perhaps you should tell him Carl?
#Unite tonight continue to put boot into Ed Miliband who seems too weak to respond. Labour still run by Union bosses http://t.co/neJfXPsHY6
See my speech on Robert Peel hospital, minister's response+ @agriffithsmp comments (scroll 08.50.15) http://t.co/X53wgWJ2F8 @tamworthherald
Just done Debate in HoC on Peel Hospital. Secured meeting with minister to discuss Burton Trust issues. Thanks to @agriffithsmp for support
@alstewitn @WhitbyAJ @tcatory @PeterBoneMP I think he just got off a call from a Lib Dem!
@russell_lee4 will see what minister says tomorrow. All good thanks
Tomorrow pm I have Adjournment Debate on proposed service reconfiguration at Robert Peel hospital. Hope Budget Debate doesn't go all night!
@Real_Dr_Roy @ConHome LNG good. Fracking also very good. Was interested to visit SaskPower's Boundary Dam CCS project last November
@MarkPawsey @ddalton40 @RugbyTory It was an honour to receive one last year. Now sits proudly on my desk!
Out in Wilnecote campaigning for @tina4wilnecote. Fantastic sunny afternoon.
Spent most day piling through constituency correspondence and planning for export week from 7th April. Meanwhile storm clouds gather above
Asked @EdwardDaveyMP 2 confirm reducing Lab's array of energy tariffs/speeding up switching helps consumers cut bills #LongTermEconomicPlan
At meeting with #Ukraine presidential candidates Vitali @Klitschko & Petro @Poroshenko hearing determined desire 4 strong democratic future
Just had MPs meeting with Sir David Higgins of #HS2 calling for much better communication & compensation + him to meet affected communities
Listening to @EricPickles discussing the regeneration of town centres at @Con_Voice event in HoC.
Lots of leaflet delivery going on this weekend (dodging the hail stones) across Tamworth plus 12,000 addressed letters.
@TCheetham I'll write you with full thoughts. 140 chars not enough. Email christopher.pincher.mp@parliament.uk if I don't have your details
Off to meet with Tamworth's head teachers this morning. Sunny morning...for the moment.
@birdsnestsblog the chances are remote but if you really want to....
Have 2 say Ed Balls' spirited (though wrong) performance in #Budget2014 debate contrasts sharply with Ed Miliband's poor effort. #Challenge?
Just spoke up for business growth, bingo tax and APD cuts + corp tax reduction plans and need to close energy infra gap in HoC #Budget2014
@birdsnestsblog @grantshapps quite a few people who work hard/have worked hard all their lives enjoy Bingo. Go to Gala or BJs to find out.
See my @ConHome comments on today's Budget here http://t.co/WYy6sEy2Go
Abolishing automatic annuity rule means pensioners control their own money and can shop around for deals THEY want #LongTermEconomicPlan
Great news that Tamworth's unemployment figure is down 731 compared with February 2013 + 100 new BMW jobs! #LongTermEconomicPlan working.
@_BradStokes thanks
#PMQs asked PM to vist Tamworth to congratulate @bmw for bringing 100 new skilled jobs to town and pay us a visit supporting...
Enjoyed giving Ian and Jackie Burley a tour of Westminster today.
To Brussels and back this morning to talk to Foratom conference about Electricity Market Reform. @FORATOM_nuclear
Just driving to Shenstone and have spotted the first BBQ of 2014. Spring in Tamworth!
Now out campaigning for @Allan_Lunn in Castle ward. Great weather. Spring has sprung?
Grateful thanks to @Conor_BurnsMP for joining @TamworthConserv St Patrick's Night dinner and speaking about Margaret Thatcher. 125 guests.
Ed Balls failing to explain how he'll pay for his spend commitments on #MarrShow. Seems to think a couple of tax incs will cover it. #Wrong
Ed Balls #MarrShow claims he'll tax bank bonuses to pay for youth jobs. Trouble is he's promised to spend that on half dozen things already
Grateful thanks to @HPoultney and @WhitbyAJ for delivering invitations to our relaunched Shenstone branch party around the village this pm.
Now with Roy Rogers, Danny Cook, @Cllrp and @HPoultney helping @MickGreatorex campaign in Mercian ward. Good feedback.

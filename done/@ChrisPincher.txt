How can SNP "represent UK wide interests" when their very existence is to destroy UK? Yet Labour flirts with them for power. @Conservatives Mon Apr 20 13:22:17 BST 2015

So Labour's Angela Eagle has let cat out of the bag - Lab will go into secret talks with SNP as price of power. Frightening. @Conservatives Sun Apr 19 18:47:39 BST 2015

@yorkierosie @craigawoodhouse personally I think it reinforces the point that EdM was hugely over rehearsed and synthetic sounding, IMHO. Sun Apr 05 12:10:33 BST 2015

@DavidWooding MT Ed Miliband also left his....notes in which he declares himself a "happy warrior". >> well he's certainly no happy eater! Sun Apr 05 00:39:24 BST 2015
Has @TheSunNewspaper checked for EdM's fingerprints on his #Leaderdebates crib-sheet? Bet they're clean as he clearly didn't use the notes! Sat Apr 04 22:37:35 BST 2015

Commentary now dust settled clear. D Cameron offers clear, controlled plan 4 UK jobs/growth. Sturgeon trounced EdM who lost #leadersdebate Fri Apr 03 10:29:48 BST 2015
#leadersdebate framed stark choice: calm clear leadership with a plan from David Cameron or chaotic rag tag alliance of Miliband/SNP/Plaid Fri Apr 03 00:08:45 BST 2015
@BBCNewsnight undecided panelist says Miliband turned her off voting Labour - "like some one selling me a car". Damning. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:55:34 BST 2015
@BBCNewsnight panel of undecided voters coming out strongly for David Cameron then next Natalie Bennett. Miliband nowhere #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 22:53:08 BST 2015
Lab's Dougie Alexander already criticising debate format. Translation: "Ed M lost and we don't like it". Ed M in SNP pocket #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 22:47:28 BST 2015
2night SNP proved they'll be broom-stale up the back of Ed Miliband's suit  in Govt. Calm controlled leadership from Cameron #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 22:36:00 BST 2015
Clear message from calm, controlled PM. Let's finish job restoring economy; let's have a better UK & not go back to square 1 #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 22:00:09 BST 2015
Miliband ends with rhetorical message. But empty of substance & too plastic- over-rehearsed to point of aching. Not credible #leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 21:56:05 BST 2015
Calm, controlled, sensible Cameron presenting one option for UK. Miliband/SNP/Plaid rag-tag coalition presenting the other #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 21:49:18 BST 2015
EdM refuses to admit that Labour (a government he served in) crashed our economy. Nick Clegg bashes EdM who looks shaken #LeaderDebates Thu Apr 02 21:40:09 BST 2015
David Cameron clearly setting out record of action & a clear plan for education, jobs and pensions. Empty rhetoric from rest #leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 21:34:51 BST 2015
EdM has clearly ruled out referendum on EU. Prime example of a Westminster bubble politician not listening to British people #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 21:26:38 BST 2015
@SuziJHill thanks 4 vote of confidence. I do believe our economic plan is gd for #Tamworth - unemp falling faster than anywhere else in UK Thu Apr 02 21:24:26 BST 2015
@SuziJHill it's all in the timing! With me you can do both. Hope you agree with my local campaigns. Thu Apr 02 21:15:59 BST 2015
EdM ducks PM's question "what about Mid Staffs?" Refuses 2 admit Labour's dreadful failure. But in Staffordshire we remember #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 21:00:02 BST 2015
EdM rehearsed up to eyeballs (possibly further). Not natural at all. Too synthetic. Cameron much more relaxed/sensible #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:55:42 BST 2015
Doctors with stethoscopes or bureaucrats with clipboards. The choice for the NHS between Conservatives or Ed Miliband/Balls #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:50:05 BST 2015
To invest more in NHS, as Con. led govt has for last 5 years, we need strong economy to pay it. That's what we're building #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:42:26 BST 2015
David Cameron reminds us alternative to Conservative #longtermeconomicplan is more debt & more taxes from ALL other parties #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:33:40 BST 2015
Labour failed to deal with tax avoidance. I sat on HoC committees which closed loop holes under this govt. EdM telling fibs #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:23:14 BST 2015
David Cameron right to say we must help working people rather than hurt working people with Labour's tax rise plans #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:13:33 BST 2015
Strong message from David Cameron about new job creation and economic growth which pays for our public services. #Leaderdebates Thu Apr 02 20:09:00 BST 2015

@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier sorry Paul. Gd debate. But you define yourself by what you're against. We by what we're for - modern town with jobs Sun Mar 29 10:15:32 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier UKIP have spent those "numbers" time and time again Sun Mar 29 10:11:59 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier even on that basis that equates to around 1000 homes. Which brownfield site are you thinking of for 1000 homes? Sun Mar 29 10:11:02 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier yes - as I made point we need (and getting) more skilled jobs in industries of tomorrow not Ukip's theme park plan Sun Mar 29 10:09:09 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier plus Tony Madge said on radio that town needs 1700 new smaller homes. Where does Ukip plan to put them? Sun Mar 29 10:03:16 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier also and interestingly when Ukip asked its plan for Tamworth they respond "wait and see." Hardly inspiring. Sun Mar 29 10:01:36 BST 2015
@pmbbiggsy @TamTownCrier 2/2 Ukip's Tony Madge plan for town (Ukip candidate failed to turn up at hustings) is to turn town into theme park Sun Mar 29 09:55:32 BST 2015

@TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk my Labour opponent hasn't turned up to a single hustings yet. Not showing much confidence - or interest. Thu Mar 26 22:39:35 GMT 2015
@MarkMcc1875 Ed M would not put an immigration limit, no clarity on borrowing or deficit in audience q. Paxo was typically tough on both Thu Mar 26 22:38:21 GMT 2015
Labour MPs already on the airwaves attacking Paxo and Kay Burley. Translation: "our man lost and we don't like it" #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:29:27 GMT 2015
Ask yourself this question. Does EdM really look & sound like a PM under cross examination by Paxo? My answer: no #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:15:22 GMT 2015
Ed Miliband saying Ed Balls was wrong under Brown. But he was there too - which is why he won't sack Ed Balls #BatleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:03:39 GMT 2015

@Charl_Dempsey @TamworthCouncil clearly the refresh period on the app needs to be addressed. Thu Mar 12 23:16:40 GMT 2015
On @BBC3 #EdMiliband is asked time & time again by young voters to rule out coalition with #SNP. And time & time again he refuses to answer Thu Mar 12 20:51:52 GMT 2015

@flynnylad looks a pretty bad fire. Wed Mar 11 11:06:42 GMT 2015
There looks to be a big fire at the Lichfield Road industrial estate. I hope it's under control and local orders are safe. Wed Mar 11 10:51:15 GMT 2015
Seems the "disturbance" is a choir. I don't think madrigals represent a threat to parliamentary security. They're quite good. Wed Mar 11 10:23:30 GMT 2015
Apparently there's a disturbance in Central Lobby. People are singing. The sun's shining so somebody's happy! Wed Mar 11 10:14:59 GMT 2015

Making TV debates constitutional & lawful? What's the infringement penalty? Like the FA #Miliband has an amazing ability to send himself up! Sat Mar 07 23:30:27 GMT 2015
@Iain_33 well given his puppet was pretty awful I guess he had good reason. But this latest #Miliband wheeze? Just plain daft. Sat Mar 07 23:28:10 GMT 2015

Raised congestion problems on A5 to the M42 in HoC. V pleased that Roads Minister believes @highwaysagency should follow my recommendations Thu Mar 05 10:27:58 GMT 2015
@VictheVicar I'll take a look at the diary Vic Thu Mar 05 08:21:23 GMT 2015
@dufflezz I'll be making that point - but weight of traffic trying to get onto A5 at eg Stonydelph nr M42 makes matters worse Thu Mar 05 08:20:58 GMT 2015
This morning I'll raise the congestion problems on Pennine Way onto the A5 with Transport ministers in the House of Commons. Thu Mar 05 07:02:08 GMT 2015

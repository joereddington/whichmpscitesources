Labour will protect Sure Start funding so it is there for another generation of children - we recognise how important Early Years for devt Thu Apr 02 08:25:48 BST 2015
The Tories’ extreme plan will cut spending in the next three years further than the last five affecting Sure Start centres & much more. Thu Apr 02 08:24:20 BST 2015

In 2010 David Cameron said he would expand Sure Start, but in government he cut it. There are 763 fewer centres today than when he became PM Thu Apr 02 08:22:46 BST 2015

.@mmmmmrob @brumcyclist Clear that's your opinion but I'm challenging behaviour of a party leader & questioning it. Why isn't  that ok?
@mmmmmrob @brumcyclist Get all of that. Are you saying that, unlike all other politicians, commenting on her behaviour is off limits?
@brumcyclist this MP doesn't. More importantly most of my constituents don't. She is Green Party leader so not unreasonable to raise it
@Spock_83 I actually contacted a big cross section of voters but inevitably miss some people. Email me and will contact you about next one

.@DaveB59 fair enough there should be a discount if you end up with the £2M garage and a really small swimming pool.
.@Petersbrooking @EdLongden I cringe constantly at what Cameron&Osborne will do if given second chance to help those they really care about
@DaveB59 Apologies gave 2010 figure. Much richer Since Tories came in. No wonder she doesn't want to pay tax on what she calls a £2M garage
.@SunarinElentari @38_degrees I agree saving NHS close to many of our hearts. Slowly seeing effects of a 4 year attack on it by the Tories
.@EdLongden actually he did defend it with rather more grace than she managed. I'm just querying her motives & think others should know
.SU4Brum @itsrachhere @ImmyKaur I'm grateful to you for reporting it. Has given a wider audience a chance to see how ludicrous it is
Was Mylene Klass £2M garage claim just a celebrity outburst? What about her £7.5M wealth as listed in Times top10 richest reality TV stars?
.@SU4Brum @BhamCityCouncil surely a joke or awards people must be as out of touch as planners. Try telling my constituents how good they are
1 in 5 crimes not recorded while govt insists crime is falling despite cuts. Explains complacency&smugness at Home Office Questions on Mon.
.@ColinGreenLD there is a clear difference between us. I don't have to justify propping up a vicious Tory government & squabble over scraps
.@DaveB59 @SashabasherAlex not sure it's just me saying it. Wasn't Mark Carney saying something very similar?
.@DaveB59 @ColinGreenLD yes borrowed more than Lab did over entire time in office.Coalition has nerve to call it clearing up Labour's 'mess'
.@BTaupe  no on UKIP. I'm Labour&want fairness,equality,opportunity,tough love&work for those who can with proper rewards. Not a UKIP agenda
.@ColinGreenLD what about those tax cuts for millionaires you lot voted for& that VAT rise weren't they immoral&punitive?
.@DaveB59 @SashabasherAlex Yes.Always thought we should save country&then go after bankers. Unfortunately coalition took over
.@ColinGreenLD LibDems backing highest borrowing Chancellor since records began &voted for VAT&student fees rise. Feel free to criticise
.@SashabasherAlex Lab ran a surplus 98-01& of £38Bn borrowed in 2007, £28Bn was investment designed to keep people in their jobs&homes

@DrAndrewWatt @ciabaudo @CommonsHomeAffs I was asked to do the Shadow Children & Families job
.@WakeUpBritain You are peddling the Tory lie. Economy was recovering from global crisis under A Darling & Osborne sent it into recession
Osborne &Cameron strut around pretending they've fixed the economy. Four&half years of austerity &Osbornomics &UK has highest deficit in EU
@StraightBat1 @HouseofTwits @dillydolly4 @Spock_83 I give up. Bet you've researched it. Why don't you tell me
Rumour of Cameron leadership crisis as Tory MPs fear Euro budget fibs will lead to even bigger defeat in Rochester&Stroud.
@StraightBat1 @HouseofTwits @dillydolly4 @Spock_83 just having fun. I'm not envious &they are 2 public schoolboys who've been caught fibbing
.@Spock_83 @dillydolly4 what 2010 cabinet wanted largely irrelevant. Ed won & If had gone other way,his brother would have expected loyalty

Cameron's answers &stats increasingly erratic only most tenuous connection to the actual question. Wonder if it's part of his long term plan
PM denies any plans to increase VAT but that's exactly what he said last time & that was a big lie
Problem with Cameron's pre-scripted answers is that he thinks it's the end of the week but those of us in the real world think it's Wenesday

@JonesFearless @simoncardy Yes they are.Forgive me for wanting to have more considered approach but I don't think of children as commodities
@JonesFearless @simoncardy yes it's slightly more than 140 characters
.@simoncardy as I've pointed out repeatedly it's enabling legislation. I'm not persuaded but govt not forcing authorities so why try & block
@sphsphsph1 Labour never had an open borders policy. That's just another Tory myth, a bit like Osborne cutting debt

@peparkin @ZacGoldsmith what about example of Brian Souter's referendum for 'Keep the Clause' campaign. Doesn't that make you think?
@ZacGoldsmith @DJDonegal @peparkin thought we left it Mon that we'd try to find consensus by Report stage. Your aims but address concerns
@peparkin @ZacGoldsmith think Zac's included in this exchange. My memory is he only refers to cost of referendum which he quotes at £35,000
@peparkin @DJDonegal I don't agree that a well resourced politically motivated group should be able to mount endless recall petitions
@ZacGoldsmith @DJDonegal @peparkin Hi Zac Hansard quotes you as saying you are quite happy to see the percentages for your petitions changed
@peparkin @DJDonegal Bill not finished. Mr Goldsmith's option or nothing not quite right to me. Tea Party could have come up with his plans
@DJDonegal @peparkin genuine problems with Zac Goldsmith plans which you appear to be ignoring. I support sane,real recall

Who is it at the BBC that wants to protect LibDems in election debates. No justification for including Clegg in a three way debate
Seems missing the A&E waiting targets for 65 weeks in a row is nothing to do with the PM. He thinks he's doing rather well on the NHS
Prime Minister refuses to come clean on immigration. Simply won't accept the facts, he said he'd cut it & he hasn't

Chancellor tells BBC govt not immune to slowdown in global economy following IMF fears. Same man who blames Labour for global crisis in 2008
@maggie_mellon @PaulaDoherty864 @Brigid39 let's stay with children& what Minister committed to when he took order through parliament
@Brigid39 if this minister allows the privatisation of children's services I believe he will be guilty of deliberately misleading parliament
@Brigid39 Believe Minister describes this as a 'not for profit' trust. We are watching what he's up to. I'm not convinced he's got it right
@Brigid39 I don't actually agree with outsourcing but equally don't favour turning a constant blind eye to poor local authority performance

.@MattJamesFord PM claims he's paying down the debt. Surely he must know if it's going up or down? Can we trust him if he's so wrong on this
PM claims that under him we're a country that pays down it's debts but Head of UK Stats says debt has grown by £430Bn since 2010. Suspicious

@davidvass63 @vineapp as you know Lab lost 2010 election and nobody won it
.@simonbates_ Obviously entitled to your view. I'm saying families on average £1600 per year worse off & tax cuts an unfunded future promise
.@simonbates_ Not saying everyone is worse off under the Tories, just majority. Always nice to hear from people who feel they are doing ok

Michael Gove first minister to stumble his way through attempts to explain economics of Tory plans. Not very convincing. Must do better
Have I got this right? 5 years of misery followed by 3more &maybe tax cuts from 2018? Hope you've got a job by then& how will it be paid for
So what will all this cost and where is the money coming from? This is the austerity party, the party that wants us to remember the DEFICIT
It's all tax cuts tomorrow unless you're a millionaire or hedge fund. They've already had their tax cuts & everyone else is paying for them
Longer term plan to balance books by 2018 not 2015 as promised in 2010. Just need more faith that more austerity will work this time-honest!
If PM serious about preventing radicalised youngsters leaving the country. What went wrong when 15 year old girl left-no questions asked?
@ColinGreenLD know you're in denial but country being run by Tory/LibDem coalition that trebled tuitions fees,cut welfare,police& local govt
@ColinGreenLD @TomPoole007 they know that you plan another £340M cuts& 6000 more jobs losses. A bit of LibDem sophistry won't change that
@ColinGreenLD @TomPoole007 nice try but it's your govt attacking the people of Birmingham now. You've forced £460M of cuts& 7000 jobs so far
@ColinGreenLD @TomPoole007 seem to be under misapprehension that this starts in 2018. We are talking about rolling cuts between 2010&2018
Is Redwood doing a Jim Sillars by threatening a day of reckoning on business leaders who don't want to leave EU. So much for free speech
.@ColinGreenLD @TomPoole007 think you'll find your government has already made the cuts and spent the money elsewhere
.@TomPoole007 @GiselaStuart William Hague has already said that he's not too concerned about the threatened loss of 6000 council jobs

Looks like Lynton Crosby& that How to Corp guy are going to have their work cut out this week. MPs leaving Ministers resigning whatever next
That's 9 of the 2010 intake standing down and 2 defections to UKIP so far. David Cameron's steadily losing control of the Tory Party
.@ostercywriter @theblondebmw @BBCBreaking David Cameron&Lynton Crosby know who Mark Reckless is. And there's more like him
.@SW1James will Grant Shapps be organising a recruitment drive for conference? To lose 1 MP is misfortune etc.
Wonder how many Tories will have defected before David Cameron's speech to party conference. Maybe they should have hired a smaller venue
.@BBCBreaking now Mark Reckless quits Tories to join UKIP. Where will it end? There are at least two more in the pipeline that we know about
.@bythewatersedge yes we agree that Hazel Blears made a really important point about addressing risks of radicalisation in this country

@mmmmmrob Syria in grip of a brutal civil war. ISIL and Assad are sworn enemies. We need Saudi's to stop terrorists getting funds.
@mmmmmrob I understand that's what you believe but doing nothing leaves ISIL free to rape, abduct, behead and terrorise a whole region
@mmmmmrob we disagree. I think you underestimate what was happening in Iraq before the 2003 war. Look at Ann Clwyd's speech today
@mmmmmrob I don't happen to believe they can be defeated solely by military action but I do believe we need to stop their advance quickly
@mmmmmrob it is quite hard to see what kind of peace initiative there could be with a group like this.
@mmmmmrob international coalition drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait,presumably you would accept that as an example of positive intervention
@michaeleccles @mmmmmrob As far as I am aware the only negotiations ISIL is interested in is about securing ransom for their hostages.
@michaeleccles @mmmmmrob I agree that bombing alone won't defeat them. That's already formed a large part of the debate. What would you do?
@mmmmmrob I assume you don't approve of ISIL & what it's doing so what would you do as an alternative?
@mmmmmrob all weapons can damage&destroy but not everyone uses rape, abduction & beheadings as deliberate instruments of terror.
@mmmmmrob vote at 5pm. Think I'll support motion as believe  ISIL must be defeated. Can't ignore their aims or what they are doing
Thoughtful speech of the day so far by Pat McFadden. We in West responsible for our actions but so are ISIL. No excuses for their barbarism

@bushbytiger @angelasmithmp no extra parliament or politicians. Use existing politicians as interim measure until people decide way forward
@Matthew_Percy agreed & purpose of a constitutional convention would be to design those options. Don't need knee jerk piecemeal solutions
@CamBeavanKing @TheIanCruise key is for people to agree future then vote on it. PCCs classic example of phoney democracy conceived in London
@TheIanCruise don't agree. Need to move quickly to constitutional convention&transitional arrangements for devolution to regions.
.@SteMorris @FloTom I'm advocating that people have a real say in how they want to be governed in response to DevoMax. Let them work it out
@SteMorris @FloTom Good devolution is about giving people more control over their own lives & stopping the domination of London&SE
@FloTom @SteMorris Don't want everything run from Westminster. People of Birmingham&West Mids perfectly capable of making own decisions
@SteMorris Want considered outcome in exactly same way as Scottish devolution was product of partnership between politicians&civic society
Devolution for England is too big to be cobbled together by politicians alone. Must involve all sections of society&reach sensible proposals
Tory demands for English Parliament grow but what's needed is a constitutional convention involving civic society to decide England's future

.@peteashton I'm beginning to think I agree with you on that. Unfortunately this is 2014 & we need a Lab Party ready to govern for today
.@peteashton that's one aspect of Labour but supposed to be for the many not the few. That's quite a broad coalition including those in work
.@peteashton as email points out, I'm interested in voters having a voice even if we don't all agree on what is a difficult issue
.@MrDaveConroy @peteashton @UKLabour as email says we don't have to agree but I'm interested in what my constituents think about immigration
.@peteashton @UKLabour afraid I despair at your knee jerk reaction. Take it you think some subjects are off limits for ordinary voters?
.@MrDaveConroy @peteashton @UKLabour Immigration a difficult subject but can't duck it even if It means silly accusations from PC brigade
I'm supporting @mencap_charity #HearMyVoice campaign, I am listening and I hope that many more will do the same http://t.co/ZAkC0d6MAL
@itsrachhere not convinced they have their priorities right. Afraid I think they're standing up for the wrong people
@NoScotland No vote seems stronger on phones tonight. No complacency but as deadline approaches people seem to sense real risk of voting Yes
@itsrachhere it's time rogue landlords, cowboy builders & dodgy extensions were taken much more seriously by Birmingham City Council

Hurst planning saga continues. Bad line but listen to confusing interview on WM. Who was that whispering during Cllr. Sharpe's interview?
@MattJamesFord @AmilKhan that's the logic of constitutional conference or convention.We hear from all sections of society&find a way forward
@MattJamesFord @AmilKhan Scottish devolution was product of a convention. Similar approach could make sense for rest of country.
@AmilKhan I'm in favour of constitutional conference to agree most efficient& cost effective way for us to decide what happens in our region
Have the comments from Jim Sillars revealed a little more of the ugly, narrow aspects of nationalism at the core of the Yes campaign?
@swrb1 @MegMunnMP @EmmaLewellBuck @CollegeofSW it's enabling legislation but we're clear if minister is wrong a Lab govt will repeal it
Vote before 14 Sept for St Mary's Hospice to secure £50k as part of the #greatbritishswitch campaign, read more here: http://t.co/IG6UHDdMrk
Scots thought to be canny when it comes to finance so why ignore Standard Life, why take a chance on pensions, why take a risk on currency?
.@patrickjbutler @MegMunnMP @EmmaLewellBuck they are enabling powers.Councils are not forced to use them. If necessary, we'll repeal them

@mommygemima @EvaPhillips does this mean your picture of broken slabs is Ashburton Road or is it a different complaint.
@mommygemima @EvaPhillips would be interesting to know where it is & if you've already reported it
@14NC what can I say? I just like food
@beckf good to see you also. Think enough folk engaged on that one
Fiona Wolf obviously a talented lawyer but not clear why it's taken nearly 2 months to find her if her talent& experience is what is needed
Me and my constituents are fed up of rogue landlords and cowboy builders ignoring the law, we say enough is enough http://t.co/HRpz1iy4bG

@swrb1 not really something to explain in a tweet buy think more explicit duty must be placed on senior staff &more emphasis on prevention
If Labour wrecked the economy &squandered all the money, why is George Osborne the highest spending highest borrowing Chancellor in history
Great to see so many children take part in this year's  #SummerReadingChallenge at Druids Heath local library http://t.co/7YW45Kj1nS
Lots of hand wringing over Rotherham. Why not a clause in all senior officer contracts that failure to safeguard children means dismissal.

@sajidjavid @alex_avern .thanks Sajid. You worry about Bromsgrove and all those questions about DCMS & local TV & I'll worry about Selly Oak
@sallywillihunt @BhamUpdates @Stirchley_News ok Sally I'll just ignore you&your little friends. That way we can be sure you won't feel upset
@sallywillihunt @BhamUpdates @Stirchley_News No one is bullying you Sally. You enjoy being provocative but can't handle even a gentle jibe
@sallywillihunt @BhamUpdates @Stirchley_News analysis of Sally's tweets suggest she likes to dish it out but a little jibe offends. So be it
@sallywillihunt @BhamUpdates @Stirchley_News I think Sally should run for world president. Just nothing she couldn't fix or do better

Strange story about RSPCA & Claude the cat. Has power gone to their heads? Who is responsible for oversight of way RSPCA uses its powers?
New Police&Crime Commissioner must concentrate solely on policing & build on work of Bob Jones. That's the job!David Jamieson choice for me
@Richmondmania @BhamCityCouncil hard to say but some sharing of Chief Execs; London Challenge involves consortia&Scots a single police force
@Richmondmania @BhamCityCouncil actually a number of authorities across England are merging certain functions & roles
@leejames316 happy to take up your concerns with Tesco but no point in me commenting on the musings in newsletters from Tory councillors
@Richmondmania @BhamCityCouncil Familiar claim but where is evidence several smaller councils wouldn't cost more&lead to fragmented services

@TheIanCruise @brigidjones Not sure a public spat with you Ian will help but if you want to know why I'm complaining loudly ring me or email
@TheIanCruise @brigidjones sorry Ian but don't think it's Tory to complain about really bad service. High standards should be a Labour goal
@brigidjones who is responsible for those who can't answer phone, process complaint or complete task? We fund 6 £100,000 plus staff.
@simonbates_ just got home to a raft of emails and phone messages from constituents complaining to their MP about services run by council
@brigidjones lousy customer service by people who don't seem to realise the council tax payers are paying their wages. Not too good!
.@HarryLangford @MsIntervention Inevitable outcome of turning blind eye to Hamas&co while ignoring anti Israeli & anti Semitism connection
Is there a secret conspiracy to run Birmingham City Council so badly that we'll all end up supporting a directly elected or imposed Mayor?
Are calls to intervene&protect Yazidis from rape&murder by ISIS brother group of Hamas, reason for Israeli intervention in Gaza,hard to take
Should incentivise Returning Officer for P&CC elections with payment by results say 0.001pence for every vote. Might gee up Elections Office
Obviously daft having P&CC election on 21 Aug. If I was in charge Elections Office would be really working for maximum turn out. Afraid not!
@GregorianChat just interested in finding way forward. Fact govt has cut Birmingham's funding. Fact Tory/LibDems ran city 2004-2012
P&C Commissioner no help at Bham Elections office. Rang for PV last week,website down.10mins more today. 'Apply online' -you can't. Useless
@GregorianChat Labour paying for it,using funds raised by Labour volunteers. May object to our approach but your insinuations are wrong

Pause in fighting in Gaza a huge relief. Now is moment for UN& all those involved to not only deliver aid but press for talks& lasting peace
@sallywillihunt it has taken you14 tweets but I think that you want to take sides and blame one party for the conflict. Afraid I can't agree
Good luck to David Hoare but wonder what signal Nicky Morgan is sending by appointing boss of struggling academy chain as new Ofsted Chair
@sallywillihunt half the time people demand MPs be honest& then object to that honesty. I'm truly sorry Sally, there's no easy solution here
@sallywillihunt Are you suggesting military intervention? Doubt UN can engage without ceasefire.Even politicians haven't got magic solutions
@sallywillihunt I am an opposition MP not part of government. I understand distress& frustration but what would you do that would end this?
@sallywillihunt I'm at work in constituency so doesn't matter to me if recess is cancelled but as you know that won't stop what's happening
@sallywillihunt Raised it at F.O.Questions b4 recess. Shd Foreign Sec has spelled out Lab's view. Others can help but protagonists must stop
@sallywillihunt Horrified like others by attacks on innocents &loss of life but ceasefire &peace plan only way to end this. Don't you agree
Michael Green warning about 'secret' Lab Death Tax Plan that isn't. Pity he's not so forthcoming about dodgy get rich quick 'rip off' plans
Govt refuses to let independent OBR audit party spending plans but claims Treasury used,at taxpayer's expense,to provide anti Lab propaganda
So higher VAT on one hand and the prospect of a flat tax on the other. 'All in it together' who are they trying to kid?
Is VAT, up by £20Bn, now 'all in it together' government's preferred tax model? If clamour for pre-election tax cuts will it have to rise?
BBC News - Jeremy Hunt ticked off over hospital waiting times data http://t.co/GhH9os3qIF

@clkh_ Been listening hard to charities& other groups since taking on Child&Families role. Want credible ideas that reflect what I'm hearing
@solobasssteve as a Shadow Minister tend not to sign EDMs which are really a backbench device but did raise Gaza at F.O.Questions on Tuesday
@clkh_ Need more than Ofsted tick box approach. Hope Govt comes round to audit idea but if not keen to explore how Lab&charities might do it
@evefrancisholt @LucyMPowell Sorry have misled you. Cleared Commons all stages. GC Lords 28 could block but unlikely.If OK report LordsTues.
@evefrancisholt @LucyMPowell if you mean SEN Code of Practice it was approved by both Houses on Thurs &used to support the Act as of Sept 1
@evefrancisholt @LucyMPowell SEN Code dealt with both Houses last Thurs. Regulations on outsourcing services 28 July Lords&3Sept Commons
Lovely speeches at funeral service for my old friend Bob Jones. Thought his Deputy Yvonne Mosquito's contribution was particularly moving
@BBCNormanS @johnprescott wasn't individual in question a Putin crony. Isn't Tory defence that they'd fallen out before Tories had the money
@YoungHustler81 thank you. Was genuinely confused. Very helpful
@JuliaHB1 another startling fact about you which I just cannot believe
British weapons bound for Russia. I raised with PM weeks ago&assured all being properly reviewed. How many arms dealers are funding Tories?
I don't really understand horse racing & thought doping in sport was about foul play. Of all items,how does morphine get to contaminate feed
All those Cameron attacks on Lab being in hock to unions. Turns out UK foreign policy limited by Tories being in hock to Russian oligarchs

@PJT006 so what are your questions
@scoutsnigelt think you'll find I am following you
Minister rejects my call for annual assessment of Local Offer& promises role for Ofsted but this means his dept won' t collect national data
Should one ambulance chief run both West Mids & East of England ambulance services& should he get £89,726 more than the PM for doing it?
All these 2010 Tories standing down. If things are going so well why are they like rats & sinking ships
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
@ChristineGHunt @EvaPhillips @CllrMikeLeddy Difference Christine is we know council's role&can vote or not for Cllrs. Not private landlords
@_P_H_9_3_ very evangelical.
@ErdingtonTories you said £11M in earlier tweet. Must check all figures&cost any ideas. Need sensible,affordable solution. Not point scoring
@ErdingtonTories you said £11M in earlier tweet. Must check all figures&cost ideas. Need an affordable,sensible solution. Not point scoring
@ErdingtonTories When you take out contingency fund &Troubled Families which is govt grant&subject to clawback, there's a lot less than £11M
@ItsGoodCake Voted for emergency Bill& took part in debate. If I had your email I'd send reply I've sent to constituents who asked about it
@ErdingtonTories If sums correct&no further govt cuts or new costs,is Tory plan to restore collections short term. What happens in long run?
@ItsGoodCake not sure you can have read my replies. Maybe you just don't like/agree with them?
@ItsGoodCake Certainly about me being honest&sincere &representing people to best of my ability but doesn't mean saying I agree when I don't
@ItsGoodCake I'm sure you are sincere in your beliefs but I think you mean that I won't be properly informed until I share your views
@ErdingtonTories scrapping present green waste policy would be one option but would need to be paid for. What would you cut to pay for it
@ItsGoodCake I'm sure you are very well informed&very sure in your beliefs but solutions in most conflicts require cooperation on both sides
@ErdingtonTories public really turned off by that kind of abuse. I'm looking for sensible solutions&to be fair, your lot left city in a mess
Sick of seeing growing piles of waste with council yellow stickers.Councillors and I have started a major consultation. Must be a better way
@HarryLangford that's my boy. Congrats

Great morning at Broadmeadow Infants. Do they have talent! Picture Samson, mum&Head. He's never missed a single day http://t.co/MD57pXUFPy
@MattBennett29 I'd start to worry if I had credibility with you. Let's face it we both know purpose of your tweets & it's not really DRIP
@MattBennett29 Shadow Home Secretary did ask, that's why I say with my own Home Office experience that it needn't have been an emergency
@MattBennett29 I didn't introduce both 'Protection of Freedoms' Bill& emergency legislation. Govt posturing has caught up with them
@sailor_jerry no I'm afraid I wasn't but I was present for quite a lot of the debate as well as voting.
@mmmmmrob sorry to hear that but used judgement &been straight about my position. If that costs me your vote -so be it. Better than me lying
@peparkin Quite a complicated ECJ ruling. True there was debate yesterday mostly from anti Europeans on whether new Bill will be compliant
@MattBennett29 @peparkin now Matt sure you'd know more about hypocrisy than me. I've supported the Police in an emergency created by Govt.
@peparkin My main consideration is what we do to ensure Police retain current powers while we sort out this mess. Not to make things harder
@neilmarsh50 @iankatz1000 not much to celebrate in Gove legacy but teachers probably entitled to a 'he's gone' party
@simonpjbest Coalition disagreement has forced this impasse but is it responsible of me to deny police powers tomorrow that exist today.
@ItsGoodCake @OpenRightsGroup Yes I do. I'm in the Chamber listening to my colleague Tom Watson on case for shorter period on Sunset Clause.
@simonpjbest Not sure how much scrutiny you want of timetable. Can argue not enough time as we did last week but it is emergency legislation
@KarenInSellyOak try Severn Trent Cartland Road Website for details of work being undertaken. Why and details of closures
@bbclaurak support like that from Mr Gove should help Christine Blower no end. Obviously she's also helped his career as reshuffle shows
@simonpjbest I voted for Programme Motion which allowed us to debate the Bill. Did you want us to argue about timetable & not the substance?

@driftsight no I think that about covers it. Congratulations on achieving your level1 first class bigot award
@bphillipsonMP sure you must be glowing
One day Home Sec is posing as 'Protection of Freedoms' Queen next day she's Mrs Snoop. Just no consistency with this coalition
In 2010 Home Sec started with Protection of Freedoms Bill. After 3 months of dithering she's forcing through emergency data retention Bill
@BCCampaign you're very welcome, thoroughly worthwhile campaign!
@mmmmmrob @RichardBurdenMP @tom_watson my plan is to be at work in House of Commons which is where I am most Mondays when House is sitting

Greg Clark confirms that £63M of Greater Birmingham's £350M receipt from Local Growth Fund will arrive on April 1st -37 days before election

Home Sec appears to have conceded a wide ranging inquiry into historic allegations of child abuse
Am I right in thinking Chris Grayling presiding over largest number of escapes & mistaken releases of any minister responsible for prisons?
@discovery77_ @davidhencke @ExaroNews I did meet with David Hencke and have agreed to come back to him on some points he raised
@discovery77_ If I say I support an inquiry and you're not committed to MPs&Exaro setting precise terms what else do you need?
@discovery77_ I support a detailed inquiry.7 MPs have done good job so far but have they a right to specify exact nature&remit of inquiry.
@KarenInSellyOak have indeed seen that vest. Is that Mother of Bournville. Evemts?

Lots of wriggling from Leader of House on Coulson. Either vetted or not. PM consulted or not. Civil servants to blame or not. Transparency!
Great evening at Speaker's House with 202 Dawberry Fields. Army Hospital Reserve. Fantastic  men&women, service in Afghanistan outstanding
Not only did David Cameron fluff PMQs but it appears he prejudiced a trial. How much bad judgement can we afford in a Prime Minister?
PM, unable to defend himself over Coulson, reverts to smears that reveal that he doesn't know right from wrong or recognise criminal guilt
Imagine the outcry if Tony Blair or Gordon Brown had employed a villain like Coulson at No10? And they say we have a free &impartial press

@ABICLTD sure does. Thought Costa Rica looked a very well organised side.
Well what a surprise Pereira. Thought it was pretty unlikely that Uruguay   could get through 90 minutes with 11 men still on the park
Yes Costa Rica. Won't be sorry to see Uruguay go out. Nothing to worry about here England unless they're allowed to kick you off the park
Very pleased to see that Viv Randall (Head of Colmore Infants)& Emma Woolf (Friends of Cotteridge Park) have received an MBE. Well deserved
Good visit to Selly Oak Trust School to open new sensory garden & outdoor gym supported by Mondelez. Great School http://t.co/D6UdYtnc9L

Speaker cut UQ on passports when Govt ran out of Tory MPs. Understand time constraint but meant many Lab MPs denied chance to raise matters
@UpYours999 @discovery77_ I am in favour of an inquiry but I want one that's timely,gets at the truth &provides justice &closure for victims
@discovery77_ Yes I like Hillsborough suggestion. As Shadow Children&Families Minister,I'm keen that we get detail,timescale&outcomes right
@discovery77_ Child abuse.I support inquiry but not yet sure of best vehicle for getting at truth&ensuring justice and closure for victims.
PM even poorer on passport crisis. Not having a good day. Badly out of touch
PM poor on Trojan Horse. Says parents should go to Head or governors&condems Birmg.LEA which was run by Tories&LibDems2004-12
Govt says processing more passports than Lab& improved economy reason why so many people want passports. And me thinking they'd messed up
@Andrew_Howell @jonwalker121 dissembling as you know parliamentary term. Others might say economical with the truth
@jonwalker121 except it's obvious that Home Sec is squirming when asked about the letter. This makes us all wonder if she's dissembling
Home Sec not very forthcoming about lessons learned;why her SPAD had to go&why it took 3 days to remove her letter from Home Office website
Launch of Microsoft Hub at BAYC.Model has a lot to offer in terms of digital learning& online safety http://t.co/JkrBeDL7Fm
Just arrived in London to add my contribution to the Policy Exchange Panel - Youth & Children's Services
Wonder if this is another phase of the long term economic plan, to further punish students & those with disabilities http://t.co/l0Xz3iTkuh
At launch of Microsoft Youth Hub at BAYC  Selly Oak. One of 35 of 160 applicants groups. Learning & keeping safe in the digital age.
Gove/May spat a bad start to Queen's Speech! Whips then get order of Mover&Seconder wrong. Strength of coalition politics?Downhill from here
@NipoleonM @RichardBurdenMP for what it's worth I also favour an urgent review of the council's current green waste policy
Myself & @RichardBurdenMP are calling on Bham C Council to take urgent action over traffic dangers @ Lifford Lane tip http://t.co/98b3dcj29u
Execution in Iran of Gholamreza Khosravi for moharebeh-'crimes against god' is more evidence of 'tolerant' Rouhani acting like a barbarian
Grant Shapps lists what he says are 100 Govt achievements. Reads a bit like one of those Michael Green 'get rich quick' schemes-How to Con
@adamplank Thought it was in selected zones. I favour 20MPH near schools&residential homes for elderly&such like. Good to consult on this
@JuliaHB1 @David_Cameron 'after lots&lots of talk we'll have a big vote&I'll convince everyone that thanks to me it's ok to vote to stay in'
Glad to see Gordon Strachan's side giving Scots something to cheer. I'm for No but is all the negativity helping the Better Together case?
Happy Birthday Tommy. Are you doing anything nice?
Why hasn't Rouhani the 'moderate' condemned calls for the flogging of actress Leila Hatami for crime of being kissed on the cheek in public?
Occasionally events remind us of just how authoritarian the instincts of the Tories really are. Gove's decision on literature is an example
Good results in Selly Oak.Pleased for Mike Leddy&Alex Buchanan. Well done Changese Khan & thank you Dee Smyth for great effort in Bournville
@lynnkathleenkel Not sure we agree on Rouhani. He's interested in image but not controlling deeds of zealots &still pursuing nuclear policy
For Alf. Nice evening on Druids Heath http://t.co/LNUHEmQ1Qr
Glastonbury Rd with @neenaformep @cllralexbuchana @CouncillorSue @steve_mccabe so far so good but a long day ahead http://t.co/yqxK0vEXXh
Iran's 'moderate' President exposed over Happy video. If Rouhani really sorry should make public apology &promise it will never happen again
@Warrmr better still let's have your address and I can ensure you don't get any communications from me.
@Warrmr not sure I've sent you any emails but let's have your details to check&if you're right I'll make sure you're deleted from any list
@deanhuckerby just stating a few realities. I'd prefer that Lab wasn't dealing with ToryLibDem's Brum legacy or cuts imposed by coalition
@deanhuckerby I know you don't want to hear it but IT costs&new central library costs set by ToryLibDem group who ran our council up to 2012
@Druids_Heath @CMP_Tweet average Band D CouncilTax in Telford is over £100 more than Birmingham&they've had less money cut from them by govt
@CMP_Tweet @Druids_Heath many of your complaints are long term& cover 8 years when ToryLibDems in charge.Lab took over bankrupt city in 2012
@JaneAitken27 those with a duty of care for all the children failed to exercise it. Recognising that is a step to stopping it in the future
@Druids_Heath Managing Govt cuts causes huge problems that's what they want &Lab council also needs to listen more but vote LibDem really!
@JaneAitken27 Do you accept the Tribunal decision has been upheld or are you saying it has been over turned?
Neena Gill's long experience in business & as former MEP shows against Tory&LibDem incumbents. It's about jobs, investment& influence.
@JaneAitken27 Don't think I imagined the Tribunal decision, the costs awarded against the Trustees or the criticism of the Head & Trustees
Phil Bennion says LibDems hoping to make gains in Birmingham in council elections. Wonder what seats he has in mind? I can't think of any
@mikeofbristol @mark_bradshaw Nick Clegg ruled out coalition with Gordon Brown. We now know that's because he's more at home with the Tories
Nick Clegg says that the role of LibDems in the coalition has been to act as guarantor of fairness. Isn't lack of fairness their trademark?
@JaneAitken27 @troubledmuriel @tom_watson obviously you can say that I should ignore parents that spoke to me but I don't agree with denial
@JonesFearless @politicsinbrum you have the advantage of knowing there will be absolutely nothing of value in the Le Grand report. I don't!
Now Brandwood. Very good response for Mike Leddy &@neenaformep #labourdoorstep. Many more doors between now & Thurs http://t.co/atE1l0Vd8b
Great response with Dee Smyth&@neenaformep in Bournville today #labourdoorstep. Looking good but much more to do http://t.co/KaSyowOWWV
@JonesFearless @politicsinbrum  I was a social worker. Will give full response when Le Grand reports. Against mass outsourcing of services
@JhonCooper @GiselaStuart @RichardBurdenMP yes a good start. But we want more of our BBC licence fee spent here & we all need to work harder
Good news that BBC is to base Academy in Brum&HR&communications jobs. It's what @GiselaStuart @RichardBurdenMP and I have been working on.
Is it part of Govt's 'long term economic plan' that in 21st century UK 5 families should have wealth of 12M people. 10% have half the wealth
Baroness Lawrence wins Grass Roots Diplomat Political Social Driver award. Can't believe I was nominated in same group. She's a great lady
@matt1nnes I'd like to hear from LAs 6th forms & others missed in consultation on funding changes for students with serious&complex needs
Minister says there was extensive consultation with LAs & all types of institutions b4 funding changes for students with severe&complex need
Even Tory councillors are now warning that decision to scrap Local Welfare Assistance will drive desperate people into arms of loansharks
Is it part of Govt's long term economic plan that nat share of post tax income of top1% of taxpayers grows while that of 27M people falls
Am I the only person who thinks the PM's total euphoria at the news of a 0.1% fall in unemployment might be a bit over the top
Anxiety voiced across the Chamber over govt plans for large secure colleges to hold boys&girls, aged 12-17. Sounds like a big unisex Borstal
@alanmills405 @EducationLabour I agree his figures were entirely specious. Something really wrong when an Education Sec can behave like this
Hope UK Statistics Authority will look at the figures the Education Sec has been throwing around this afternoon. They sound very dubious
@TraceyBriggs1 Dee Smyth doesn't have a twitter account. Has worked hard in Bournville&used to work for Allenscroft Project and a good woman

Think it's time for BBC to explain difference between their decision to drop Carol Thatcher despite her apology & Jeremy Clarkson situation.
@Barneybonkers I didn't bother to answer a silly question just made a silly jibe instead. Does that qualify me for a job on the Daily Mail
@Barneybonkers let's face it your username is rather apt when it comes to to the way you unquestioningly swallowTory propaganda

@MW988 @DuncanStott yes I'm talking about proposed law in Queen's Speech to encourage fracking &bypass rights of landowners
What's happened to Tory values?Tory govt to weaken rights of private landowners. An Englishman's home is his castle but will his land be his
@theresecoffey your news report confirms Osborne was wrong in 2010, the weak state of economy after3 years&cost to families of his policies
@theresecoffey try reading what George Osborne said in first budget. Know it's difficult but always better to accept what's in black & white
Last time Man Utd board this brave they went through7 managers &relegation before regaining top spot in the league. Easy to sack the manager
@chrisg0000 I'm not responsible for his ever changing story: deficit,borrowing,triple x credit rating,unemployment. Wrong cuts & for the few
@theresecoffey you've missed the point,4 years of austerity to clear deficit & it hasn't happened & now pretending you've fixed the economy
By2015 Osborne will have borrowed more in5 years than Lab in13 &be offering 4 more years of austerity yet he's planning pre-election taxcuts

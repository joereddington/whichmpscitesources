@PeteSims1 where is it & when? Wed Feb 18 21:49:25 GMT 2015
.@A2Mac @MacfarlaneRobin Obviously an expert. I bow to your omniscience. You know so much more about Labour than its members&supporters Wed Feb 18 21:48:19 GMT 2015
.@A2Mac @MacfarlaneRobin I think it is about powerful, dominant elites. For them democracy is a veneer&character assassination common Wed Feb 18 21:19:21 GMT 2015
.@jeannesmith1 @LeagueACS We lost Mike's Bill but didn't give up. We got there despite opposition,don't you remember invasion of the Chamber Wed Feb 18 19:19:39 GMT 2015
.@jeannesmith1 @LeagueACS not sure I'd say last minute.Difficult but Alun Michael did great job steering it through against huge filibuster Wed Feb 18 19:01:33 GMT 2015
So Tory donor Sir John Ritblat & Samantha Cameron's pal Harold Tillman don't think it would be good if Ed Miliband wins. I bet they don't! Wed Feb 18 18:32:43 GMT 2015

#labourdoorstep.Brandwood Lab hits the Coverts Druids Heath. Good response http://t.co/KE4iSp9o3p Sun Feb 15 13:14:41 GMT 2015
.@jpowell79 personally I doubt Stirchley needs anymore hot food takeaways but will only change things by changing power of the planners Sat Feb 14 22:07:28 GMT 2015
.@Mr_Kwacky sorry but don't know. Are they all new outlets & therefore subject to a change of use? If so council planners must have approved Sat Feb 14 21:00:15 GMT 2015

#labourdoorstep yet another Saturday morning session in Billesley. They don't like Cameron on NHS or tax dodging http://t.co/Hfyjsg0dsj Sat Feb 14 13:21:29 GMT 2015
.@TomPoole007 David Cameron cares about the people of Birmingham the way he cares about the NHS and claims  'we are all in it together' Fri Feb 13 22:37:12 GMT 2015
.@NickChandley @BPrimary very good to meet you and really impressed with work you are doing with young people at Billesley Junior School Fri Feb 13 22:28:11 GMT 2015
Scientists have certainly got a lot of theories but not yet clear exactly what has been visiting Bournville Juniors http://t.co/QcznUNzGDV Fri Feb 13 17:11:56 GMT 2015
Finally get a chance to visit Bournville Juniors & see IT for myself. Definitely Something Strange http://t.co/lwpYcfpwJN Fri Feb 13 17:06:08 GMT 2015
.@HThornbery @pollyn1 sometimes there's just no justice in the world Fri Feb 13 09:06:40 GMT 2015
For those obsessed with issue, a Lab govt won't scrap FrontLine nor can all social work training be judged by a 100 place experimental prog Fri Feb 13 08:27:39 GMT 2015
.@simoncardy would you&Fearless care to point to my 'on the record' remarks. Tory fibs I take for granted. What's your motive? Thu Feb 12 23:42:39 GMT 2015
.@joewaIsh 13 years of Labour government pumped money into this city. Not sure 8 years of a Tory/LibDem council did it much good Thu Feb 12 23:30:18 GMT 2015
.@joewaIsh @RogerGodsiff @ShabanaMahmood @johnhemmingmp @tom_pwatson @LorelyBurt @GiselaStuart Osborne's not in Brum corner. He's against us Thu Feb 12 22:43:38 GMT 2015
How is Tim Sherwood any guarantee against relegation or building better team for future. Having sacked Lambert surely they need experience Thu Feb 12 22:40:18 GMT 2015
.@simoncardy funny talent you have for constant false accusations Don't they call this one the 'when will you stop beating your wife charge' Thu Feb 12 22:34:01 GMT 2015
.@simoncardy I think the politics of someone who tweets about demolition of Labour policy&then claims he doesn't know what is is does matter Thu Feb 12 21:40:01 GMT 2015
.@dezzatyson @Labour_MH good for you. Have you secured a place? When do you start? Where will you study? Thu Feb 12 18:34:59 GMT 2015
Council house if you give up benefits (for life?) Sounds bit like Rights for Shares but even more of a disaster -latest IDS wheeze for votes Thu Feb 12 16:40:45 GMT 2015
.@birminghampost Osborne wants people of Birmingham to crawl begging to him on hands &knees. I want fair share of what's rightfully ours Thu Feb 12 16:18:00 GMT 2015
.@dezzatyson @Labour_MH agree-great thing about Combat Stress is that many of the have been in the forces & understand what it's like Thu Feb 12 15:29:07 GMT 2015
So all those who asked me about tax dodging, you have Tory Lord Fink's (well named)view 'everyone does it' Lab doesn't agree&we'll tackle it Thu Feb 12 15:27:02 GMT 2015
#hearts4kids with Scott Rutherford. Truly inspirational beneficiary of a heart transplant. His story is so moving. http://t.co/DL4dcpszId Thu Feb 12 09:38:19 GMT 2015

.@dezzatyson @Labour_MH not sure what you have in mind. Need to talk to Vernon Coaker.I'm a fan of Combat Stress.Should build on their work Thu Feb 12 09:22:03 GMT 2015
.@simoncardy article is fair response for those who were critical of original piece. I think your views on Labour reflect your politics Thu Feb 12 09:17:39 GMT 2015
Priti Patel says 'let's be clear'. She's anything but clear in winding up on HSBC. Need the truth on this one. Afraid it sums up the Tories Wed Feb 11 18:57:35 GMT 2015
@purpleline @HouseofTwits we didn't take their money,give him a peerage & turn a blind eye to tax evasion. Time to come clean on this one Wed Feb 11 17:19:48 GMT 2015
@ShabanaMahmood one of our most able frontbenchers taking government apart in Tax Avoidance debate. Awful stench from No10 on this one Wed Feb 11 17:04:19 GMT 2015
Inconceivable David Cameron didn't know about HSBC tax evasion. HMRC David Hartnett told select committee in 2011 'whole nation knows' Wed Feb 11 16:59:09 GMT 2015
@jauger I wrote to Albert Bore about this for another constituent. Email your address&I'll copy reply. Cllrs not MPs making this decision Wed Feb 11 14:07:32 GMT 2015
@Methodist_TJN @GiselaStuart thanks. I did manage to pop in Wed Feb 11 12:46:08 GMT 2015
Can't see how Cameron gets away with this one. What did he know&when. What did he do about it & was he still taking their money throughout. Wed Feb 11 12:37:35 GMT 2015
Never answers the questions but today at PMQs on HSBC tax avoidance Cameron resembles guy in police interview room repeating No Comment Wed Feb 11 12:30:30 GMT 2015
#maketaxfair thanks Jane. An idea whose time has come me thinks http://t.co/HSmiSBuYGc Wed Feb 11 10:14:37 GMT 2015
@lawrenceLevin @JaphyRyder_ of course, no hard feelings. Tory smear prevalent in campaign.Have to rebutt untruths lest people believe them Wed Feb 11 09:09:53 GMT 2015
.@lawrenceLevin @JaphyRyder_ one minute you're smearing me, next you're insulting my constituents. Not much point in engaging with you Tue Feb 10 22:48:53 GMT 2015
.@lawrenceLevin @JaphyRyder_ I've never had a safe seat &my brother in law runs a sub post office. Pointless if you're just a smear merchant Tue Feb 10 22:43:43 GMT 2015

.@crdolby @JaphyRyder_ @lawrenceLevin looking at a number of your previous tweets I don't think anyone has just convinced you to vote Tory Tue Feb 10 21:50:26 GMT 2015
.@JaphyRyder_ @lawrenceLevin no Labour's ambition is a change of direction. Hope for the future& new priorities despite economic pressures Tue Feb 10 21:03:45 GMT 2015
.@JaphyRyder_ @lawrenceLevin because not our ambition to take us back to public sector spending levels of 1930s we want growth&public sector Tue Feb 10 20:54:46 GMT 2015
.@lawrenceLevin if you're one of those who buys that lie about bankrupting the country, chances are you'll vote Tory&vote for more austerity Tue Feb 10 20:28:21 GMT 2015

Very privileged to see part of Adamson collection at Speaker's House. Art as healing, work by psychiatric patients http://t.co/DcDBUrAQ2j Tue Feb 10 20:15:57 GMT 2015
Just spoken in police debate. Even if West Mids got Â£10M ofÂ£43M entitled to we'd still be hit 3times harder than all other forces in country Tue Feb 10 15:50:42 GMT 2015
Wonder what they're talking about at tonight's fat cat Tory fundraising bash. Foodbanks, zero hour contracts, bank fraud, doing in Miliband! Mon Feb 09 22:11:56 GMT 2015
The wonderful Melissa Benn was on top form at the launch of centenary year for Keir Hardie in Westminster tonight http://t.co/8Hqei9IFsq Mon Feb 09 21:07:44 GMT 2015
#hearts4kids with Scott Rutherford. Truly inspirational beneficiary of a heart transplant. His story is so moving http://t.co/vuh1dnbFHP Mon Feb 09 20:51:44 GMT 2015
#swingthevote funny how normal& totally reasonable these concerns are. We should all acknowledge they have a point http://t.co/Kqb2ihN5HY Mon Feb 09 18:53:17 GMT 2015

.@NFZSyria @campbellclaret as Ban Ki-Moon said, we shouldn't need resolutions over humanitarian aid. What is it you'd like to see happen Sun Feb 08 18:13:33 GMT 2015
@AnnaYearley She is a total star. Sun Feb 08 14:16:07 GMT 2015

.@JoWarner01 @leicesterliz I'm a social worker I'm not baiting anyone. I'm asking a few questions& responding to some of your comments Sat Feb 07 00:49:59 GMT 2015
.@JoWarner01 @leicesterliz I assume you are labouring under the delusion that I wrote the article. I'm McCabe not one of the authors Sat Feb 07 00:34:20 GMT 2015
@JoWarner01 @leicesterliz clearly a mere mortal like me will never live up to your expectations.Wonder how all those poor service users cope Sat Feb 07 00:23:36 GMT 2015
.@JoWarner01 @leicesterliz not sure what you are accusing me of Jo but happy to debate my thoughts on social work &sector with you anytime Sat Feb 07 00:05:51 GMT 2015
@JoWarner01 @leicesterliz sorry Jo but think I've had enough of politics of cliches as well. If article offends so much challenge& refute it Fri Feb 06 23:51:28 GMT 2015
@AnnaGupta2 @ProfSueWhite @Brigid39 @leicesterliz @ProgressOnline Not member of Progress, no say over editorial policy. Doubt they'd say no Fri Feb 06 23:19:41 GMT 2015
@ProfSueWhite @AnnaGupta2 @leicesterliz @Brigid39 Strikes me as a sales pitch &someone's opinion. I'd be interested to read a critique Fri Feb 06 23:15:28 GMT 2015
@AnnaGupta2 @HarrietHarman I've replied to @Brigid39 Offensive?May well want to challenge some of it but isn't that what academics do anyway Fri Feb 06 22:58:34 GMT 2015
@JerryTaylor Don't know. That's why I am asking questions.Does performance vary across police authorities? Does it have high enough priority Fri Feb 06 22:17:46 GMT 2015
@AnnaGupta2 @leicesterliz what is an offensive and ill informed piece of propaganda. Fri Feb 06 22:14:47 GMT 2015
.@JerryTaylor I have evidence that many offenders are not caught and prosecuted. I am asking why? Fri Feb 06 22:13:17 GMT 2015
@Brigid39 reads like a sales pitch. Did the 2 MPs actually write it? You may well challenge some of it but does that make it defamatory? Fri Feb 06 22:09:37 GMT 2015
.@JerryTaylor In favour of safer roads also but if you knock a child down on a pedestrian crossing&drive off you should be caught&punished Fri Feb 06 10:31:31 GMT 2015

.@harrison2009 @labourpress PM&Chancellor working as team or maybe two conmen in it together Wed Feb 04 14:32:30 GMT 2015
Another 30 mins of PM porky pies. Robotic, scripted responses from PM. Some downright lies and no effort to answer or explain. Waste of time Wed Feb 04 12:38:24 GMT 2015
George Osborne desperately trying to brief PM on hedge funds & stamp duty as he wriggles & obfuscates. A pathetic sight. Wed Feb 04 12:14:06 GMT 2015
Prime Minister point blank refuses 5times to answer very specific question about stamp duty &hedge funds is it because they fund the Tories? Wed Feb 04 12:11:20 GMT 2015
@damienhealy figure of speech really but science&aims are rather important on this one, particularly given opponents questioning the science Tue Feb 03 21:07:11 GMT 2015

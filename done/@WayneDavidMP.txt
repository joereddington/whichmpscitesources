@MidWalesMike He said that in House of Commons in response to questions about G20.
Cameron has criticised people who write emails to their MPs because they don't "understand" the issues. Very patronising #Cameronoutoftouch
Spoke at well attended #1WW history event in Chepstow. My theme was 'COs and 1 WW - Morgan Jones and Ness Edwards' http://t.co/557BzcFKnw
Superb play with Lewis School, Pengam pupils about 'war'. Morgan Jones, 1st CO to be elected to Parl, loomed large. http://t.co/ElwVjvzwOl
#BBCQuestionTime Tory Stephen Crabb talking absolute nonsense when he said that Cameron has respect for NHS and those who work in it.
Tomorrow @Ed_Miliband will make a  speech setting out why next year's General Election is so important #6monthstowin
@Jemima26275521 We would ensure Welfare Reform was done in a fair way. We would scrap the bedroom tax for a start.
Had W.minster Hall Debate on 'Impact of Welfare Reform on Welsh Valleys'. £430m every year is being lost to Valleys' through welfare cuts.
Incredible if Cameron is not now giving vote to H of Cs on European Arrest Warrant, after he gave clear, emphatic, unambiguous promise #EAW
@GwentNews You should never believe everything you read in the Press!
Good attendances at Remembrance Services at Machen this morning and Caerphilly this afternoon. Great to see so many youngsters involved.
@BBCWales #sundaypolitics referred to #SundaySupplement interview where I showed that @Ed_Miliband wasn't part of W.minster elite #webackEd
On @BBCRadioWales #SundaySupplement this morning pointing out that stuff in media about @Ed_Miliband is 'nonsense'. #webackEd
Did radio interview on @LBC. Said @Ed_Miliband has policies and vision to take this country forward. Parl @LabourParty is of same opinion.
Cameron's refusal to say where he stood on UK's membership of EU, will surely have been noted with concern by British business #EU #PMQs
Brilliant response in Bedwas, Caerphilly to @LabourParty (I took the photo) #labourdoorstep http://t.co/BsMsrsvjTH

I am clear that #NHS should be excluded from Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership #TTip It could reinforce govt's plans.
Cameron went on about #welshnhs cos he can't answer quests on #englishnhs. Crude diversionary tactic which people will see through #PMQs.
Just asked Health Sec if he had seen Western Mail @WalesOnline and its condemnation of "scaremongering" on the Welsh NHS. #NHS #welshnhs

Important and historic vote tonight. House of Commons voted overwhelmingly that Palestine should be recognised as a 'State'.
Just done @BBCWales #SundayPolitics saying @LabourParty will vigorously address issues which concern people, including immigration.
#marr @HarrietHarman spot on! It's Lab which is in tune with concerns of Brit people. We have clear policies not right wing empty rhetoric.
#marr Let's be clear, Carswell is a right winger who has never supported any policies which favour working people.

"Former" Tory MP Carswell forcing by-elect and standing for UKIP must terrify the Tories. If Carswell wins, other Tory MPs could follow him.
Salmond is engaging in the worst debating tactic -  deliberate misrepresentation. Salmond is coming across as arrogant #indydebate #indyref
Salmond is on back foot again re Currency. Pathetic. As he goes on he is digging himself deeper into a hole #indydebate #indyref
Salmond is making things up re NHS in Wales. Dear me. His arguments are very weak.

#bbcsp Tory Europe Minister fails to say what govt wants to renegotiate with EU. Tories are all over the place.
#marr William Hague doesn't want Britain to leave EU but Cameron's crass EU 'tactics' is taking us in that direction. #EU

@DafyddOliver You therefore accept that Plaid are guilty of deception by trying to say that Assembly can ban zero hour contracts.
@DafyddOliver Because Assembly doesn't have power to do this. This is worst kind of posturing by Plaid. They are not a serious Party.
@bbclaurak ? This is not devolved. How can Plaid say this?
Lab hold Blackwood council seat (Islwyn) on @CaerphillyCBC . Indep 2nd, then Plaid and Tories last. Congrats to new Lab Coun Allan Rees.
Great response today for our Lab Euro candidates @JBryantWales @derekvaughan in Bedwas. Good to see @OwenSmithMP joining Caerphilly team.

Vicious attacks on health service in Wales by tories are shown to be vacuous by new report. @fmwales  Cameron is anti-Welsh. #nastyparty
Prime Minster's idea of strong leadership is to do nothing for a week over Maria Miller and then to say that he didn't make her go. #pmqs
In Susan Elan Jones' debate on #PIP in Wales 13 Labour MPs, 1 Plaid, no Tories no LDs. Speaks volumes. Capita and DWP are failing badly.
Unsurprisingly, Tory Andrew Lansley is finding it very hard indeed to defend Maria Miller on #newsnight . He doesn't think she will resign.
Pleasure to meet with students and staff from Wyclif Independent Christian School during their visit to Parliament http://t.co/Dp6E0Y5LhK
#marr IDS says #bedroomtax is "balanced and fair". Nothing demonstrates that Tories are still the 'nasty' Party.
#marr Bottom line is that IDS' idea of  Welfare Reform is primarily about cuts not fairness. DWP is in chaos. Vulnerable are paying price.
Busy day helping Islwyn CLP with by-elect to @CaerphillyCBC , going to 'do' with Caerphilly Ladies Choir and tonight @YMCA in Abertridwr.
Labour has pledged to scrap Lobbying Act, better known as 'Gagging' Act. Good news for charities, campaigns and open debate. #democracy
After Cameron's woeful performance today, he needs to remember that in #PMQs he is supposed to 'answer' the quests. The clue is in the title
It is simply beyond belief that LibDems are trying to distance themselves from #bedroomtax . Their grubby little hands are all over it.
Poor old Vince Cable can't explain away sale of Royal Mail well below its value. It's an impossible task. Apology needed. #RoyalMail
@nibboofbrad Thanks for this. I will pass on ur appreciation to my staff!
@Kazziekitten @mylocalviewmag #local I'm glad u find my views interesting!
@OwenSmithMP gives commitment to Wales having same tax powers as Scotland under Labour. Strong speech, well delivered. #WelshLabour14
Proud of Caerphilly CLP getting award for 'good campaigning in a heartland seat'. #welshlab14 #winningtrust
@JBryantWales makes powerful speech at #welshlab14 about importance of the EU to Wales. Now need to spread the word over next few weeks #EU
Superb speech from@Ed_Miliband at Welsh Lab Conf. Members are really getting geared-up for Euro elections and General Election #welshlab14
In @CaerphillyCBC there's been 32% increase in council house rent arrears due to #bedroomtax . No smaller properties for people to move to.
Went to Funeral of Tony Benn. Very moving service with wonderful tributes from his children and his brother. Ended with singing of Red Flag.
Asked Attorney General if he was satisfied that UK was meeting all its obligations to Ukraine under Budapest Memorandum. #Ukraine
Pressed DWP Minister about how much extra would go to Councils because of govt's cock-up on #bedroomtax . No answer.
Warmest congrats to Stephen Kinnock selected as Lab cand for Aberavon. Am told he won by 1 vote, just as his dad won Bedwellty nom yrs ago.
Meeting @JBryantWales when she comes to Caerphilly later today. On #CostOfCameronDay building for European Parliament elections.
V good #labourdoorstep in Cardiff Central #costofcameron #CostofClegg @JoStevensLabour Many former LDs coming to Lab. http://t.co/tEXDKo3334
Looking forward to #costofcameron campaigning in Cardiff Central tomorrow with great candidate @JoStevensLabour
Anything is possible! Curry at Senior Citizens 'do' in Gilfach, Bargoed. Great credit on @BargoedTC who organised it. http://t.co/jQUjYJd2tA
Opened Post Offices in Ystrad Mynach and Cefn Hengoed with @JeffCuthbert AM. Heart of the community. @postofficenews http://t.co/tws3IX0J9z
Visit to impressive Cwmaber Junior School. Given tour of school by Georgina and Charlie, Head Girl and Head Boy. http://t.co/5XMYgiYCBl
@brattandeaf Yes I will.
#bbcqt For goodness, there are now so many #foodbanks because so many people cannot make ends meet! You tell 'em @andyburnhammp
Wonderful speech by Hilary Benn in tribute to his father. It was followed by warm applause from both sides of the House.
Cameron is at Euro Council. He needs to argue for real action on Climate Change as a matter of urgency! #tellcameron http://t.co/OxkXs2lLXB
@joeyjonessky Eric Pickles was sleeping tight during Chancellor's speech and Sir George Young was struggling to keep his eyes open.
For millions of working people who are struggling to make ends meet, this #budget14 offered nothing.
Have just been watching Russian TV RT. Incredible how they get western so-called academics and experts to talk such rubbish about #ukraine
@brattandeaf good to meet to yesterday. Important points, well made. Look forward to having brief from you.
@brattandeaf Great. See u just after 5 in W.minster hall.
@brattandeaf Hi Jeff. Are u still around at 5?
@jw1392 That is my understanding. Although the Welsh Govt may have some powers to 'tweek' the serttlement.
#bbcsp Wales. Freud admits that Housing Benefit reform and #BedroomTax is all about saving money. It has nothing to do with fairness.
Salmond gives poor interview on #Marr . Has weak arguments, is dismissive and seems washed out. #indyref @BetterTogether
"@ProgressOnline: Decision of LCC and NOLS in 1985 to back Kinnock was important strategic shift in the battles of 1980s" True, I was there!
Tony Benn - one of the great politicians of his time. I had privilege of knowing him from early '80s. Great communicator + radical socialist
@GwentNews I am in favour of a vote on EU membership if there is a proposal for more decision making to move from the UK to the EU.
@CharlieElphicke U are wrong! Current lock is ref on Treaty changes; our cast iron lock is referendum on EU membership.
#EU @Ed_Miliband 's pledge on referendum will ensure that there's no chance of an Ireland scenario. There will be cast iron lock.
@Ed_Miliband gives guarantee that if there is Treaty giving more power to EU, there will be referendum on our membership of EU. #EU
Shocked and saddened to hear that Bob Crow has died. He was an impressive advocate and fighter on behalf of his members.
@VaughanRoderick We will have to have a chat about all of this sometime.
@BBCWales Excellent documentary about 84-85 Miners' Strike with Kim Howells. Brought back memories of strike that could never have been won.
#EngvWales No question about it, England were better team and deserved to win. Wales has lessons to learn.
#EngvWales This has potential for being cracking game! May the best team win, and I'm sure it will be Wales.
#bbcsp IDS' attitude to disabled children is disgraceful. The #BedroomTax is morally wrong and it must be scrapped. Under Lab it will be.
#bbcsp It's very clear that govt is struggling for 'anything' to put in Queen's Speech. Coalition has no purpose or direction #shambles
Was compere at concert for Caerphilly Miners Centre with Caerphilly Ladies Choir + @BTM_Band Next Generation Ensemble http://t.co/fROooJ2nCK
Had busy surgery in Bedwas today. Many serious cases, including cancer patient who was been given 0 points by #Capita in his PIP assessment.
In work poverty is now huge issue. Low wages, zero hour contracts, high child care costs, part time work. Living wage needed. #workingpoor
@TheWalesReport Very good interview with @fmWales Carwyn Jones. Wants to take devolution forward within a UK framework. #powerclosetopeople
As I said on #BBCSP Wales, there needs to be Welfare Reform but it should be fair. Govt's policies are not fair. Look at #bedroomtax
#BBCSP Wales. Leader of Welsh LibDems can't explain why her Party is doing so poorly in opin polls. Does Kirsty Williams listen to people?
What a great St David's Day! Tremendous @LabourParty Special Conf. Overwhelming support for @Ed_Miliband and his plans. #OneNationPolitics
Special @LabourParty Conference gives well deserved, huge applause to @HarrietHarman  #OneNationPolitics
So pleased that Len McCluskey was such an effective warm-up act to brilliant Ian McCartney. #OneNationPolitics
Really powerful speech from @Ed_Miliband at Special Conference. Correctly says that 'change' comes from movements. #OneNationPolitics
Huge turnout at @LabourParty special conference in London. Promises to be historic event. #OneNationPolitics http://t.co/DIZkCMbCuU
Wonderful piece by Elizabeth Smith on how @Ed_Miliband is taking forward John Smith's vision  http://t.co/NVvhIiUaBf
@CaerphillyCBC Understand that Plaid Cymru group walked out of  council budget meeting. They really are irresponsible shower! #ccbcbudget
@CaerphillyCBC budget has been agreed. Difficult times but Lab Council has budget which protects jobs and vital services. #ccbcbudget
Good, sensible and constructive discussion at @UKChangingUnion meeting this afternoon in Westminster. #reservedpowers
Very sad to hear that Dennis Turner has passed away. Dennis was a very decent man and a great character. He will be missed in Parliament
This is best joke in Westminster. Tories have said 'We are the workers' party and we are on your side'. #workersparty
@Nickynackynoooo Warmest congrats to @SYDICYC You deserve all the support and praise you get! Doing fab job with young people.
Good ques from @BlaenauGwentMP to IDS re Universal Credit mess. S of S talks much quicker than programme is being introduced. #shambles
Looking forward to meeting Lab's newest MP @Mjpkane. His reputation goes before him - he will be great MP!
#Murnaghan Heseltine talks a lot of sense on EU and UKIP. But it's a minority view in today's Tory party. Cameron is flirting with exit.
#Murnaghan Burnham correctly says that change in @LabourParty is truly significant. We need to listen to people.
#bbcqt What are odds on Hammond getting name of @leicesterliz wrong for 3rd time? By way, it's not true Kennedy hasn't been on fiddle.
It's simply absurd for govt to claim that food banks are creating demand for their usage. They're needed cos of govt's policies #foodbanks
Been to Elim Church homeless initiative in Caerphilly. Wonderful volunteers deserve full support. Good partnership with @CaerphillyCBC
@AllieRenison Look at my tweet.
Implications of EU Commission President's comments re Scotland are huge! How on earth are SNP going to respond to this? #indyref
#marr Pres of EU Commission says that it will be "extremely difficult if not impossible" for Independent Scotland to join EU #indyref
#marr Despite rhetoric of Cameron, Pres of EU Commission says govt hasn't says what it wants repatriated #Euroconfusion
Good coffee morning with a difference for Miners Centre in Caerphilly's Twyn. Ends with great sing-song with Val. http://t.co/2OHh0CJy3R
@Rigarray Thank you Craig. I really hope everything will be alright with your wife.
#Wythenshawe "Very good result for Lab" says @SkyNews Disastrous for Tories, catastrophic for LibDems, and not really that good for UKIP.
Press report that Tories dropping MPs Recall Bill. Is end of coalition's Constitutional Reform agenda. All talk. @ZacGoldsmith #Fail
@morganlfc77 yes I visited plant and met union reps + owners. WG were prepared to assist but owners were determined to close no matter what.
In Commons just asked Transport Sec how much extra money will be coming to Wales to deal with transport disruption. No answer.
Pleased to meet @joel_nathan_p from Caerphilly at @votesat16 lobby in Westminster. Putting across a very good case. http://t.co/Fg6A5LUbsg
Lab "wins" #bedroomtax vote but it will need a Lab govt to get rid of this terrible legislation ... And we will!
@pamibells I will!
Great evening with @GloriaDePieroMP in support of @Mari_Williams and @JoStevensLabour . All building towards Lab victories in Cardiff N & C.
Glad to hear from Cameron that "money is no object". No doubt there has been full liaison with George Osborne. #floods
Just asked Eric Pickles about 'cabinet rift' between himself and Owen Paterson re #flooding . Pickles said they were like "2 peas in pod".
Just seen @IrrancaDaviesMP at Sainsbury Bridgend raising funds for youngsters to visit Borneo on charity trip. Well done that man #onhisbike
#bbcsp Did Andrew Neill refer to @LindsayHoyle_MP as good deputy speaker but couldn't recall his name?
@RachelReevesMP says she is proud that nearly half of shadow cabinet are women. Spot on. Lab setting good example for other parties #marr
#marr @RachelReevesMP We have got to do better for our young people. Essential to make work pay. Living wage vital. Housing very important.
Ireland well on top in 1st half and deserve lead. Wales now need to change their tactics. #IREvWAL
@AngelaMalibu Yes, they are good cars! #audi
Despite wind, rain and cold, Caerphilly Labour team out in force in Bedwas. #labourdoorstep http://t.co/yi4lZ73fSN
Cameron is in Somerset. I wonder if he will meet angry locals with the BBC filming. #floods
Made point in Commons debate on Scotland's place in UK that "union" is with Wales and N Ireland as well as with England #BetterTogether
Been to @fsb_hq National Chairman's Dinner. Good to see so many Lab MPs there. Helping to make point that Lab is on the side of SMEs.
Thanks to those who pointed out my error! I obviously meant Aidan Burley.
@jameschappers more haste less speed
Tory MP Adrian Bailey who organised Nazi-themed stag party in French Alps is standing down at the election. #offensivebehaviour
@gezkirby Plaid play into Tory hands because they are so fixated with constitutional agenda. Never mind that it's against Welsh interests.
#PMQs What a surprise! Bill Cash asked a question about Europe. Some things never change.
With my 88 year old mam watching #PMQs on TV. She has just asked me why Tories don't have more women MPs. Good question.
#PMQs Watching on TV. Cameron comes across as totally insincere, too concerned with sound bites. Real contrast to genuine @Ed_Miliband
Important that young people register to vote. National Register to Vote Day http://t.co/J8KFIZHR4r to get your form #NRVD
Extremely pleased that Labour's NEC has approved @Ed_Miliband 's plans for reforming the Trade Union link with Party. 1 Person, 1 Vote.
@Carrageryr Hope you didn't run off with diners cash like u did in Brighton (inadvertently) with Caerphilly delegs being held at knife point
This is an unusual tweet for me: Am amazed that Tories have deselected MP Anne McIntosh. She is 1 of most intelligent, hard working
#murnaghan @KeeleyMP makes very good, sensible points about Environment Agency. What a contrast with Tory leader in Welsh Assembly.
#murnaghan I remember John Smith's reforms. @Ed_Miliband 's plan completes changes he began. 1 Person, 1 Vote is surely way forward for Lab.
Powerful piece @andrewrawnsley in the Observer: http://t.co/UqH5ZsWJ5A on Lab reforms. Shows that @Ed_Miliband is right on 1 Person 1 Vote.
#Marr @HarrietHarman makes it clear that trade union members active at local level will rejuvenate Lab. Radical change for better #democracy
@CeltBeers 'Celt Experience: Fire Festival' in Caerphilly. Good 'do' with very successful not so micro, micro brewery! (Pity about weather).
Great @welshlabour Gala Dinner last night with special guests  @JiffyRugby and @GetRhysWilliams Good curtain raiser for today. #6nations
@Ed_Miliband pledges to complete the unfinished business of past 20 yrs. Important piece http://t.co/5zO3rpfTLz
#PMQs Cameron got into a terrible mess today. @IanMurrayMP helpfully told him which page in his notes answer could be found to his ques.
Just did @lbc973 on today's launch of Lab's campaign #JusticeForCoalfields @MichaelDugherMP Important to support former mining communities.
#newsnight @edballsmp gave good interview with Paxman. Robust, sensible and confident. Is in tune with common sense of the country.
Today is Holocaust Memorial Day. Important to remember genocides, including those which have been in recent past. #HolocaustMemorialDay
As I was saying yesterday ... Welsh Nats like their Scottish counterparts living in cloud cuckoo land http://t.co/K9LiUnPpBI #BetterTogether
Welcome re-opening of Ystrad Mynach Police Station to public and police use of new library in Caerphilly. Sensible. http://t.co/6WLiM72IPq
@cerithrhys Don't be silly. Look at ALL opinion polls.
#murnaghan #stateoftheunionUK Salmond says many in Wales "cheer" moves to Scottish Indep. Wrong! Welsh overwhelmingly reject separation.
#murnaghan #stateoftheunionUK Important to remember that "union" is with Wales as well as England. In modern world need to look out not in.
#Marr @edballsmp It is important to tackle deficit in a fair way. Lab isn't anti-business but anti-business as usual. Seems reasonable to me
@m6rt Yes but millions know it's fair!
Understand Tory MPs are livid about @edballsmp promise to increase income tax by 5p for top earners. I thought we were all in this together.
@Worthy_15 U are of course right! Might have had something to do with figures being blown off board in terrible storm. @CaeRfc
Pam Baldwin and Phil Emmanuel drowning their sorrows after Caerphilly game. Got to be philosophical! http://t.co/hiI5Jl1uI2
Good game between Caerphilly and Croesyceiliog. Pity cheesemen lost 18 16. Nothing to do with game sponsor (me).
Busy Advice Surgery in @CABAction Bargoed. Due to Welsh Assembly they haven't been hit as hard by cuts as English counterparts. But future?
#bbcqt Member of audience "there shouldn't be a need for food banks". Quite right! They are an indication of need in today's Britain.
@kimdeslandes3 If Kim says University staff should be supported, then they should be supported!
@michaelsheen No not "MPs" but Tory and LibDem MPs! They are ones to point finger at. An attack on democracy itself.
@spike_humphrey yes, Tories little helpers, LibDems, supported them on #GaggingBill. They certainly don't want scrutiny of their record!
Made speech pointing out that no. of Brits working in EU institutions is declining. Bad for UK's nat interest. Blame Govt's Euro- scepticism
Tories defeat important amendment from Lords re #GaggingBill . They want to minimise debate and scrutiny of govt record before election.
#PMQs @Ed_Miliband clearly on top today. Showed concern, commitment and understanding of people's realities.
@Minas100 I will have no fear!
@aneurin_evans I will support 'em but the Bill is still bad!
#marr Very clear that @Ed_Miliband is again setting political agenda; energy, cost of living, banks, competition, consumers. #intouch
#marr  Good rallying call from @Ed_Miliband. We need a new politics - inside Lab and in the country. People must come first.
#marr @Ed_Miliband Consumers and competition need to be heart of the agenda. Only if there is effective competition will consumers benefit.
#marr @Ed_Miliband sees Germany as good example of effective decentralised banking system. Need to earn and grow our way to prosperity.

Great concert with one-and-only Aber Valley MVC for @CaerphillyWorkm Hall. Brilliant soloists too! #cwh http://t.co/yzbHoRkSzw
@Ed_Miliband really gave an inspiring speech this morning. Good combination of 'vision' and practical policies to create a #BetterBritain
@Ed_Miliband wants banks to serve the people, not the other way round. We need an Industrial policy for all the country. #OneNationEconomy
"Deficit reduction alone is not a vision for the country" says @Ed_Miliband Britain needs hope, fairness and opportunity. #OneNationEconomy
'Britain doesn't seem to work for ordinary people any more' says @Ed_Miliband Our challenge is to change this. #OneNationEconomy
@Ed_Miliband will set out why there needs to be more competition and choice in banking. Keeping things as they are isn't way forward.
Pointed out to House that if Scotland left Union, excellent rock band in Commons would be MP3 not MP4. Would Leader of House hold auditions?
Tories have finally formally acknowledged that they were wrong on Minimum Wage. Just matter of time before they accept many other "errors".
And they pretend to be fit for Government. Welcome to Groundhog Day. http://t.co/2k8myFj8jS

Fantastic library officially opened today by @CaerphillyCBC in the town. What a superb facility, already well used.
Today was very emotional in Commons. Wonderful tributes were paid to late Paul Goggins. This evening I attended Mass in Commons Chapel.
Asked Europe Min why PM in his EU statement hadn't welcomed fact that EU has made largest ever contribution to humanitarian relief in Syria.
#marr Cameron wants rich to get richer! He wants to help his millionaire friends. This is clear despite his inability to answer a question.
#marr Will Cameron say that he wants rich to get richer by cutting further top rate of income tax?
Labour would close loophole that allows Agency workers to undercut directly employed staff. #Miliband
Intelligent piece by Tristram Hunt on Tories distorting complex history of 1WW  http://t.co/qqzuGo8cCx
@Gethin76 @unoghoulie Well said Gethin. You are spot on!
Morgan Jones (Caerphilly) was 1st C.O. to be elected an MP. He was brave man who suffered enormously for his view of WW1. Gove note #c4news
Now clear from govt papers that in '84 Thatcher had hit list of mines they wanted to close. Windsor and Bedwas Colls shut soon after strike.
Natural Resources Wales has issued statement that there may well be major flood alerts tomorrow! In south, Newport particularly at risk.
Happy New Year to everyone! May 2014 bring peace and happiness.
Best New Year Honours response has got to be from Gavin and Stacey star Ruth Jones. Her award of an MBE was greeted with "it's proper tidy".
Warmest congratulations to Dame @RosemaryButler. Is great Presiding Officer at Welsh Assembly & has done much to advance position of women.

Brilliant Showcase concert with 4 Counties young people incl @CaerphillyCBC at Cardiff City Hall. Shows wide range of talent among youth.
Lab will continue to clear-up mess left to 'em by Plaid on @CaerphillyCBC  Plaid let Senior Officers run Council with disastrous results.
@CaerphillyCBC "acted unlawfully" when senior officers gave themselves big allowances. Why did Plaid Cymru allow this? PC were in control.
Asked Festive Ques in House about need for Ministers to make New Year resolutions to give statements to House before the Press. Fat chance!
If anyone doubts that this Tory/LibDem govt cares only about rich, they need only listen to #foodbankdebate. Govt view is terrible.
Hywel Francis MP presents @Ed_Miliband with copy of his new book 'Do Miners Read Dickens?'. Brilliant book! http://t.co/zylbX6e98r

Lord Wyn Roberts has passed on. Will be remembered as astute non-Thatcherite tory. Liked by nearly everyone. Kept tory flame alive in Wales.
Warmest congratulations to my friend and colleague Anne Clwyd MP for her award as Welsh Politician of the Year. Tenacious and determined!
@gethyn_ellis I agree with 2 points you make!
IPSA is not in real world. 11% pay increase for MPs is totally unacceptable. IPSA must think again and withdraw their plans immediately.
Asked Iain Duncan Smith in Commons if he thought he had any credibility left after fiasco of Universal Credit. #UniversalCredit
@PeterHain modestly thanks those who, rightly, paid tribute to his work, before praising struggle of Anti-Apartheid Movt. Many impt memories
Statesmanlike and moving tribute to #Mandela by @Ed_Miliband in House of Commons.

Brilliant interview with Neil Kinnock #Marr . Wonderful comments about #Mandela . Also stated core of Lab's 'fair' approach to the economy.
@CaerphillyCBC to be congratulated on placing books of condolence for #Mandela in Borough's main libraries. I signed the book in Bargoed.

The reality behind the #AutumnStatement  Spend just couple of minutes to view this http://t.co/CgzHgJHiDJ

So pleased that @fmwales Carwyn Jones has announced an Inquiry into the events around Operation Jasmine and elder abuse in Gwent.
#PMQs Even Tories now say that Clegg is sounding like one of them. Aside from EU views, Clegg IS a Tory, he just hasn't made it public yet.
Good ques from @PhilWilsonMP on EU. #PMQs Great to see expression on Tory faces when Clegg agreed that Tory hostility to EU is bad for UK.

Osborne's plans will not tackle problem of escalating fuel prices. Energy comps will be happy. Govt should take them on and #freezethatbill
#marr Osborne should tell low pay and part time workers, and those on zero hour contracts about his job "rich" recovery. Living standards?
#marr Osborne is resorting to deliberately misrepresenting Lab. Shows weakness of his economic position. Prices rising faster than wages.
#marr Govt should "get a grip" says @edballsmp. Lab would #freezethatbill and restructure energy market. Make energy comps pay not people.
#marr @edballsmp stresses need for affordable houses and for tough decisions under Lab. But "living standards are falling" under ConDems.

Energy comps & govt  trying to come to deal over prices up to gen election. Guess what will happen after '15 if Tories win. #freezethatbill

Dave U turn Cameron: 1st pay day loans, then immigration, now plain tobacco packaging. Lab lead, tories follow. Govt is not coherent. #Uturn
Good attendance at Annual Nye Bevan Memorial Lecture in W.minster. TUC's Frances O'Grady is Speaker. Important message re politics & houses.
Has been accurately said " Cameron achieved all he wanted to achieve when he entered No. 10". No coherence. No principles. No vision. #
Last year big 6 energy comps enjoyed profit margin of 20%! And yet govt refuses to 'intervene,
Good to see at least some credit being given to Catherine Ashton, EU High Commissioner, for her central role in securing Iran nuclear deal.
@MargaretKeenan Really good discussion this morning. @VaughanRoderick. Ur programme is one of few which offers opportunity for proper debate
Just been watching Ireland v New Zealand. What a superb game! Feel so sorry for the Irish but fantastic win by All Blacks.
@Ed_Miliband came across really well on Desert Island Discs but he should have had 1 piece of classical music, preferably an Oboe concerto.
@Ed_Miliband on Desert Island Discs today at 11 15 am Radio 4. I'm told it's well worth listening too.
#marr @YvetteCooperMP says Tory Party is now Nasty Party again. Remember modernisation? In the distant past. #Britaindeservesbetter

#PMQs Cameron hits new low by saying Michael Meacher has been taking mind altering substances.

I understand that David Cameron is having his biography written. Does he know "the writing is on the wall?" #endgame
Tories and LibDems vote to keep #BedroomTax but maj only 26. Lab won the argument and fight goes on.
Have referred to case of Mr & Mrs Goodwin in Caerphilly County Borough in debate on #BedroomTax . Both are registered blind and have to pay.
Just spoken at anti #BedroomTax lobby in Commons. Supported by @unitetheunion and @DailyMirror. Lab will vote to scrap it!
@RachelReevesMP gives good, strong and honest speech to #BedroomTax lobby in W.minster. Lab will scrap this terrible tax.
V good piece by @EmmaReynoldsMP  on Channel 4 on Housing. Highlighted failure of govt and showed what Lab will prioritise  #affordablehomes
I guess there was well over 600 in Caerphilly for afternoon Remembrance Service. More wreaths than for many years. http://t.co/CxXGNvkoX9
Good turnout at Bargoed for Remembrance Service. Now on to Caerphilly for afternoon Service. Wonderful to see so many children involved.
V good presentation from Nick Ireland, Political Officer USDAW, to Caerphilly GC. Standing up for shop workers. #Respect13
Attended and spoke at moving service at Caerphilly Cenotaph with children of town. Wonderful to see youngsters there, despite bad weather.
Great visit to Glyn Gaer Primary School in Gelligaer. Attended lovely morning assembly. Then tour of the school. http://t.co/rcSufAZXzQ
Have spoken in House about Morgan Jones. Lab MP for Caerphilly and 1st Conscientious Objector to be elected to W.minster. #pride
Great to meet Cathryn Hughes from Caerphilly at Barclay's Bank graduation in Commons. Congratulations! http://t.co/v4yx7ZFQyO
Great ques from @heidi_mp about A & E. Hopeless response from Cameron. He hasn't got a clue!
#PMQs Cameron reduced to attempting to deny @Ed_Miliband's accurate and objective facts about looming winter crisis in NHS.
@JonCruddasMP gives sparkling talk about importance of faith based politics at #ChristiansOnTheLeft Need to go beyond economistic approach.
#ChristiansOnTheLeft Really great gathering for launch of what was CSM. 'Restoring connection between lifestyle and policy'. @stephenctimms
At great Young Musicians Gala at St John's Smith Square. What talent! Supported by @classicfm and Parliamentary Group on Classical Music.
Bad news of potential 162 jobs going in Sapa aluminium in Bedwas, Caerphilly. Have spoken with company and will do all I can to save jobs.
Financial Times reports " Each UK household benefits by £3,000 a year from Britain's EU membership says CBI". Worth thinking about!
@OlafCaiLarsen As Wales Office Min I was involved in detailed discussions with Holtham et al & reform was planned. But we lost '10 election.
Cardiff City have won South Wales historic derby with Swansea City 1- 0. And they deserved to win too! Ymlaen the Blue Birds #cardiffcity
@ArfonJ The "new" alignment in Welsh politics - Tories and Welsh Nats?
@JonAshworth Warmest congratulations on the addition to the family!
@Elin_A_Roberts Lab had Holtham Rpt and pledge to change in manifesto. ConDems in power doing nothing. Plaid posturing as usual.
Wales #bbcsp  Tories, Plaid and LibDems, for different reasons, in unholy alliance over devo of income tax. Happy for Wales to be worse off
About to go to 50th birthday party in Maesteg for my good friend Huw  @IrrancaDaviesMP. Should be great night!
@BBCRadioWales Leader of Plaid Cymru lacks basic economic understanding. Their policies would play into Tory hands and impoverish Wales.
Part devolution of Income Tax to Wales without reform of Barnett Formula would be bad news for Wales. Low Welsh tax base. #SilkCommission
#bbcqt Glad member of audience raised privatisation of probation service. This is crazy, ideologically driven policy. Govt scrapped pilots!
#BBCQT @ChrisBryantMP in good form. Making reasonable points about trade unionism and need to have more working class MPs.
That should have read Lab lead up 14 points re the squeezed middle.
New opinion poll gives Lab a lead of 14% amongst the 'squeezed middle'. Tory support down and LibDem support plummets http://t.co/lqAl3r6uB4
Labour’s energy price freeze would benefit nearly 36,000 households in Caerphilly
 http://t.co/I0EQgWW670
@labourwhips past & present give thanks to Roland Hunt for nearly 40 yrs of service in Lab Whips Office. A good man. http://t.co/vGDQls66TD
@CarolineFlintMP totally demolishes Ed Davey re Annual Energy Statement. ConDem govt simply will not stand up to big 6 energy comps #energy
LibDems 'abstained' on qualified teachers vote. Clegg has shown that you can't believe a word he says. (And I'm being very restrained).
In House of Commons, Europe Minister failed to answer my ques on which competencies govt would try to repatriate from EU. #EUwaffle
Asked William Hague about the terrible human rights abuses in Sri Lanka. PM & For Sec must raise concerns forcefully at Commonwealth meeting
@MurrayMcKirdle Yes I was! And you?
Coming into London on train which is very, very late. Can't blame weather. Just another failing of First Great Western and Network Rail.
#bbcsp Wales @AlbertOwenMP really knows what he's talking about on energy. Unlike Jenny Willott MP who is ? But she is a LibDem after all
#bbcsp Wales @AlbertOwenMP on welfare reform. Change there must be but it must be done properly and fairly. Govt's approach is ham fisted.
#bbcsp No messing @CarolineFlintMP says how Lab will reform energy market. What a contrast to lack of ideas and confusion with Tory-led govt
@HarrietHarman puts @LabourParty case on HS2 and Press with clarity. Rightly criticises Tory Party Chair for his threats against BBC. #marr
#marrshow
Well done @calumhiggins the new @welshlabour candidate for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr. You are part of the future.
@CaerphillyLab out today in Nelson #labourdoorstep Great response to @Ed_Miliband 's stance on energy prices. Bad weather won't stop us!!
On hearing that Jack Straw is to step down as MP for Blackburn, I reflect on his huge contrib to Brit politics and Lab Pty. A true colossus.
Duncan Smith hits back at John Major the 'intellect' behind traffic cones hotline. Fun when tories talk honestly about each other #torylove
Tory Press Office have been really attacking @timfarron re #BBCQT  If you didn't know, you'd never guess there's a ConDem govt #govtshambles
#BBCQT @CarolineFlintMP  clearly on top re energy pricing - forceful, persuasive and sensible. Govt are still all over the place.
As I was saying, asked ques in the House about Cameron making "answers" up in #PMQs.
Consensus is that Cameron hit a new low in today's PMQs. He had no answers to @Ed_Miliband 's questions. He even got basic facts wrong.
Great night in Commons celebrating Dylan Thomas Centenary @OwenSmithMP spoke well and all credit to @GeraintDaviesMP http://t.co/oIYJy5oAEW
Former PM John Major has said that it was unforgivable to call his former colleagues "bastards". Said his only excuse was that it was true.
Alas, it wasn't true - it was a training exercise which went wrong! But for a moment ...http://t.co/vzXHzS9uFK
@MichaelDugherMP Good piece! Thanks for mentioning @Senghenydd1913  We had a wonderful Service there last week.
@LukeOHolland Sorry to hear ur leaving Cardiff. You have been a great Councillor! All the best for the future.
Told Tory Educ Min Liz Truss was "somewhat surprised" at Clegg's remarks on Free Schools. Love to know what she really said. #Coalitionmess
Very heartfelt interview on Newsweek @ITVWales by my good friend Tyrone O'Sullivan about Senghenydd and what coal mining meant for Wales.
#Murnaghan Clegg says he wants qualif teachers in Free Schools & LibDem Laws is wrong in supporting policy of Clegg's govt #libdemconfusion
Clegg seems to be agreeing with Lab on qualified teachers and Free Schools. On thurs Laws supported unqualified teachers. #libdemconfusion
@LabourRoyall I would love to know what you said to them!
Have been knocking doors and talking to people #labourdoorstep in Ystrad Mynach. Strong support for @Ed_Miliband 's energy price freeze.
Surprised that Plaid's Parl Leader Elfyn Llwyd MP is stepping down at Gen Elect. He is liked and respected by all in W.minster.
@Ed_Miliband proposing that there be levy on payday loan comps to fund credit unions. Great idea. Credit unions don't have crazy int rates.
@Nickynackynoooo You are right. This is a great piece of work.
I had privilege of meeting Baroness Lawrence with @Ed_Miliband just after she was introduced to the Lords. http://t.co/L4ROPZr2In
Wonderful ceremony  @Senghenydd1913 . An appropriate memorial to all those who lost their lives in coal industry. http://t.co/jTborCQAu6
@Senghenydd1913 Ceremony just about to begin. Huge crowd. Already very moving. http://t.co/ouW2QVeLy6
Been to great Gymanfa Ganu (singing festival) in Senghenydd. Everything in place for unveiling of National Mining Memorial tomorrow morning.
@Markfergusonuk Honestly, @JohnRentoul is totally wrong! @Ed_Miliband has chosen a team which he believes CAN win the next General Election.
Been to opening of Undercurrent Arts Festival in Aber Valley. Amazing paintings, poetry & writing by local people. Superb young harpist too.
Full Advice Surgery in Nelson. Lack of social housing was the single biggest issue. This must be a priority for an incoming Lab govt.
Seeing Cameron on TV trying to justify doing nothing on energy prices, I was reminded of y.day's PMQs. @GrahamJones_MP hit Cameron for 6.
Tabled Parliamentary motion to mark the centenary of Britain's worst mining disaster at @Senghenydd1913 on Monday http://t.co/jyyAH2UiQ4
On @BBCRadioWales tomor at c 7 35 re appointment of new Chief Constab of Gwent Police. Why was there only 1 applicant?
In Commons there are only 3 tories present for debate on #gaggingbill . There are dozen LibDems though, making sure charities are shackled.
Excellent appointment of @ChrisBryantMP to important Welfare  job. Congratulations!
@GwentPCC Congratulations to Jeff Farrar @gwentchief the 'designate' Chief Constable of Gwent. He is a first rate Police Officer.
Delighted to be PPS to @Ed_Miliband and doing everything possible to secure the election of a Labour govt.
Wouldn't it be nice if Chloe Smith took #gaggingbill with her when she leaves Cabinet Office. Despite "concessions" Bill is still terrible.
Great night in Bargoed @YMCA celebrating 75 yrs of service to the community. Wonderful book showing all the achievements and memories.
@adrianmasters84 A Brass Band? I bet they aren't from South Wales.
"@DrEoinCl: Security appointed by the Tories at #Cpc13 is G4S. They have prevented the BBC from filming the 40,000 strong #NHS299 Demo"
"@gmpolice: 40,000 protestors marching through Manchester and not one arrest." The @bbc "not able" to report + Tories on about Communists!!
When all is said and done, don't forget tories stand up for and represent the rich and privileged. They are about conserving for the few.
Article worth having a look at re Lab's policy of energy pricing. Policy ought to have cross party support. http://t.co/4mWQ5XfmEr
On train from #Lab13 I heard 2 young women talking. They had no interest in politics but had heard @Ed_Miliband's speech and were impressed.
@BBCWales Wonderful celebration of Max Boyce's 70th Birthday. Bringing back memories of 1 of greatest Welsh performers ever #HymnsAndArias
Pleased to say that a knocked William Hague off his perch last night at 'Coconut shy' at @DailyMirror "do" in Brighton. Satisfying. #Lab13
#Lab13 @Ed_Miliband's commitment to freeze gas and electric prices for 20 months will mean that household bills will be cut by up to £120.
#Lab13 It was a privilege to meet Doreen Lawrence at Conf. A determined and brave woman -  will be an excellent Lab Peer. @LabourLordsUK
#Lab13 @SadiqKhan to speak soon. He's got a v good speech. I have read it and it's certainly worth listening to.
@Jason_Simms Intervent by govts re energy pricing occurs in 8 other EU states. Energy market should be subj to responsible social control.
Just did interview and phone-in on LBC on @votesat16. V important policy and the @Ed_Miliband  announcement was well received by Lab conf.
Speech of @Ed_Miliband described as impressive tour de force by @adamboultonSKY. This it was. Speech was really quite remarkable.
#Lab13 Delighted that @Ed_Miliband committed @LabourParty to @votesat16 Delegates pleased too.
#Lab13 @Ed_Miliband Congrats Carwyn Jones @fmwales and makes powerful case for the United Kingdom.
#Lab13 @Ed_Miliband is speaking to country as well as Lab. Speaking with warmth, humour, sincerity and decency. Against race to the bottom.
#Lab13 Packed hall in Brighton ready for @Ed_Miliband. Prediction -  will show how Brit CAN do better. Full of policy, vision, inspiration.
#Lab13 Speculation that in his big speech @Ed_Miliband will focus on small businesses and creating homes. Both vitally important.
#Lab13 Yesterday did my "tour" of exhibitors stands. Great range of organisations, companies & campaigns. All adding to optimism for Lab.
#Lab13 Anticipation already building for @Ed_Miliband big speech. So far it's been policy rich conf. I'm sure this will continue...
#lab13 @edballsmp says Lab will roll back privatisation of health service and no blank cheque for HS2. OBR will examine Lab's spending plans
#lab13 @edballsmp Great joke about  David Cameron and the need for him to throw in the towel. Great speech. Attacks 3 wasted yrs of Cam govt
Great speech by Carwyn Jones @fmwales at #lab13 Showed how Lab Wales is leading the way: on EMA, preventing NHS privatisation and much else.
@angelaeagle Chair of National Policy Forum makes witty and clever speech. Shows how @LabourParty is preparing full and inspiring manifesto.
#lab13 Lab will pledge to ditch #ATOS Many disabled people who've come to me for help due to this company will be pleased. Right thing to do
#Marr @Ed_Miliband comes across as a totally decent man, which is what he is! Country needs his honesty and commitment. #lab13
#lab13 @Ed_Miliband is focused on "the bread and butter issues" which people are concerned about. Lab is Party of the many.
@Ed_Miliband strong and confident on #Marr explaining Lab's approach to immigration and Minimum Wage #lab13 Says Lab "will be responsible".
@GwentNews Lab will pay for this by ending tax dodges and loopholes. It's very carefully costed.
@Ed_Milliband pledges @LabourParty will increase Minimum Wage. Lab is Party of people. Tories and their LibDem helpers rep privileged few.
Having Chaired AGM of Caerphilly Miners Hospital Centre, now on way to Brighton for #lab13. Mood of @welshlabour delegates certainly upbeat.
When I told @CaerphillyLab GC that future Lab govt would scrap #BedroomTax there was  spontaneous round of applause! Party reflects country.
@LabourParty members in Caerphilly CLP delighted that @Ed_Miliband will scrap #BedroomTax. It's unfair and not working.
#Rethinkawards Fab night in N.port with DSSmithRecycling. Awards being given to range of individs. Also funds being raised for Ty Hafan.
It all happens in @CaerphillyCBC . Sir Bradley Wiggins leads #tourofbritain as it comes to @Visitcaerphilly . Just hope weather gets better.
#newsnight Huge rent arrears being caused by unfair #BedroomTax. It's morally wrong and is economic lunacy. Tory MP's 'defense' is pathetic.
Funny I didn't hear any LibDem MP explain to their conf why they supported the #gaggingbill. I'm sure   charities would have been interested
#WelshGreats @BBCWales Gwyn A Williams said "1st  time I saw a Tory was traumatic, not least because it coincided with crisis of puberty".
#WelshGreats @BBCWales I recall as a student the very 1st words I heard Gwyn Alf speak "My name is Prof Gwyn A Williams and I'm a Marxist".
@nickbowes1975 And I was just about to give you my warmest congratulations! Never mind.
Objective prog on @ITVWales about Wales' PCCs. Debate now is whether to curb their powers or to get rid of 'em completely. UK is not the US.
Spoke to Caerphilly Probus this morning. Really good discussion. And the ham and chips afterwards was pretty good too.
@GwentPCC U need to stop ur vendetta against Gwent Lab MPs. You're doing yourself no good and, more importantly, u are harming Gwent police.
Nick Clegg says LibDems are party for 'jobs'. He should say that to young unemployed, part time workers and low paid in the Rhymney Valley.
Good to hear that 5p charge for plastic bags is to be introd in Eng. @welshlabour in Welsh Assembly @fmwales (and N Ire) leading the way.
@DanLauraCurtis Thanks. I will look it up!
Great concert tonight for Caerphilly Miners' Centre. I played my Oboe and compered it. Fantastic local musical talent (excluding myself).
In the Commons Mark Harper, Home Office Minister, doing his best to 'talk out' Bills. Not good way to deal with Parliamentary business.
Asked in H of Cs Cttee re 2014 EP elects. Will govt have ballot papers in Wales in Welsh & Eng? Will there be new rules re voting to 10 pm?
#PMQs @Ed_Miliband strong on falling living standards. 38 months of  decline. Cameron getting red in the face.
In tonight's vote on #GaggingBill #LobbyingBill there were 10 Tory rebels but no LibDems. Govt maj was only 30.
@angelasmithmp makes strong speech against #LobbyingBill Govt should be taking 'big money' out of politics not gagging charities.
Today sees 1st day of Committee Stage of #LobbyingBill . It's a terrible Bill and should be withdrawn. #GaggingBill
Proms in Park @CaerphillyCBC @Visitcaerphilly with@BBCWales Fantastic evening. Brilliant music. Great atmosphere. http://t.co/wTlNp7e14l
Everybody getting ready for Proms in Park @CaerphillyCBC @Visitcaerphilly  Will be great night! What a fab setting. http://t.co/r9OzLIgo0m
Unveiling plaque to Malcolm Uphill important Caerphilly Motor Cyclist who was big in late '60s. Great local effort. http://t.co/PQapSJspRI
Saddened to hear of the death of Geoffrey Goodman. Wonderful journalist and follower of Nye Bevan. A totally decent man.
Justice Sec has 2nd thoughts on aspects of Legal Aid reform. A climb down which is welcome but devil is in detail. Lab is still concerned.
Good discussion on @SkyNews about Wales leading the way in charging for carrier bags. It has been successful. Learn from Welsh example!
Govt win progr motion with maj of 51 on #LobbyingBill . Disappointing that tories seem to be happy to push through Bill which gags Charities
Tory MP Angie Bray says that backbenchers often described as lobby fodder. #LobbyingBill enshrines this in law.
Only 9 tories left in Chamber for 2nd reading of #LobbyingBill . They are embarrassed by it, and so they should be.
#LobbyingBill As Angela Eagle said, to call this Bill a dog's breakfast is to be unfair to the nutritional value of dog food.
Just asked Europe Minister about progress towards normalising relations between Kosovo and Serbia. UN and EU High Rep have important role.
@Nanna_Baps Good question. I suspect it's result of an alliance between the 2- #fools and #knaves with a contribution from the #malevolent
Even by govt's standards, this #lobbying Bill is so, so bad. It will hit Charities hard. What about the big society?  http://t.co/V3V7d0vesK
This is a 1st for me. Have a look at this Tory blog on #lobbying Bill. It supports what @LabourParty has been saying  http://t.co/99D2uggGRO
Intelligent piece by @PeterHain in today's Sunday Telegraph #Syria  http://t.co/ixvL72ovvD
Way Cameron is now attacking @edmiliband over #Syria, after having messed up Parl's recall, really does question his suitability to be PM.
@david_taylor Re accommodation whips. I like the tale about Ken Livingstone best.
Have received dozens of emails, tel calls, tweets from constituents. Overwhelmingly people are against ill thought out intervention in Syria
Will NOT support govt's position on Syria. Govt has a poorly thought out position.
@braders_81 You are very kind.
@DRC1649 Thanks! Nice of you to say so.
Just did @BBCRadioWales on govt's plans to impose draconian curbs on Charities ability to campaign a year before elections.
An article I wrote on why it is only Labour that can get the necessary reform of the European Court of Human Rights http://t.co/iJcnMeM3iX
Just done interview for LBC on political engagement, young people and @16andVOTE
Everyone in South Wales is so proud of @CardiffCityFC tonight. Great win. Can be sure there were plenty of supporters at game from Valleys.
Police to investigate 2 PCCs. Don't forget Winston Roddick also 'forget' to mention he was a LibDem when he stood  http://t.co/UIB7mCdzZl
@estheryoud Unfortunately can't make Caerphilly Megaday but I've given bottle of House of Commons whisky to help a great cause. @VelindreCC
Charities are v worried about govt's plans to curb their activities through Lobbying Bill. Crass attempt to push law through quickly.
An intelligent piece worth reading! http://t.co/vkyOTHmQSt
@Lynnccourtney I feel really sorry for that crocodile!
This p.m. did interview in favour of @Votesat16 on LBC. Good discussion.
@johndowle What? And how did you spell grammar? #potskettlesblack
Tories trying to rush thro Lobbying Bill. Will have little on effect on lobbying but will really hurt voluntary orgs  http://t.co/eaCdIMTZIC
Cameron has rang EU Commission Pres to tell him EU law must be upheld re Gibraltar. Quite right. Glad PM now thinks there are good EU laws.
I've known Galloway since his War on Want days. He hasn't changed. He never will. http://t.co/ZkUY3QQUT9
Good luck to all my constituents who have their A Level results tomorrow. Fingers crossed for you.
Most important point about @Ed_Miliband egging incident was superb way Ed continued with his TV interview.
Celebrating 50 yrs of local company PHS in Caerphilly with Chief Exec and @JeffCuthbert AM. http://t.co/XUZqYIArUv
Ironic that Cameron is considering legal challenge against Spain over Gibraltar through European Court. Perhaps coming to see EU not all bad
Giving blood at Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly. Have just been given badge for having given blood 10 times. http://t.co/TC2fnJZq0m
Just written piece on @Votesat16 for local paper. Worrying research by @UKChangingUnion on young people's disinterest in how Wales is run.
@IsabelOakeshott Most "hard working" MPs are in their constituencies working. Journalists ought to spend more time in real world.
Nothing better shows that Tories are out of touch than Welsh Tories policy of bringing back Grammar schools. #backtothefuture
Will Farage condemn UKIP MEP's outrageous comments about aid to "bongo, bongo land"?
Welsh Tories want Grammar schools brought back but say they're against 11 plus #confused Will elements in Plaid be so keen to work with 'em?

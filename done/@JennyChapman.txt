@JennyChapman
@feedthedrummer I know, it really isn't class war on streets of Darlington, just plenty of people fed up with an incompetent nasty govt
@englishoak @BridgeLakes died 20 years ago, loved Buttermere, so we hired a bus from Darlo with all his mates and scattered his ashes in it
@feedthedrummer noted
@IanAustinMP @CrepeStation careful Ian, looks a bit bourgeois to me
@englishoak @BridgeLakes my Dad's in that lake, walked round it for 100th-ish time this summer, prettiest lake by far #buttermere
@hopisen or rather our frustration at not being able to do what we want. In that case I'll read it properly, and tell @PhilWilsonMP
@hopisen been saying that for long time, glad you've said it properly and in a clever pamphlet.  Well done.
@EllieCumbo bear with Ellie!
@AhmetFuat3 yes, need to understand better what the unshackling involves but expect I'll agree with you
@davrwu @LabourEoin having voted to privatise NHS 18 times they decided to vote against it today #ifyoudontliketheseprinciplesivegotothers
@TrevorOakley1 but only if commissioners determined that was best option for patients, which is why it remained fraction of overall activity
@TrevorOakley1 they allowed it where local NHS decides it's needed, on NHS's terms, Tories making competition mandatory
With other Labour MPs ahead of today's vote against NHS privatisation. http://t.co/ezFkt9BJyO

@SteveH8960 spotted! I was a bit worried I'd miss the vote but made it in good time.
I can't see her from where I am but told @RehanaAzam spotted in gallery for #backthebill #saveournhs debate
@oliverbagpuss I will
@TeasdaleNeville my pleasure

@JBeattieMirror @AndyMcDonaldMP I have no say in it but I think he'd be great
@AlisonMcFDundee I'm on my way to do just that
No surgery this morning.  School run then on train to London to vote to protect our NHS.
@PeteSims1 I'm not sure about that one, I thought it was a bit too prescriptive, still considering. Also EDMs are totally ineffective.

@KateUmpleby @PhilWilsonMP @GregMulholland1 @FairDeal4Locals @EchoPeterBarron in favour of course!
@Forestersarms2 @PhilWilsonMP @EchoPeterBarron will do
@KateUmpleby @GregMulholland1 @FairDeal4Locals @PhilWilsonMP @EchoPeterBarron I will do, thanks for the nudge

@DannyBrownMYP wish I'd been there to watch our future MP get some practise in! Well done.
Had DFC/1883 meeting this aft, all positive, keeping up momentum ahead of likely move back home next year.
Hope I don't live to regret saying this...the people now running our football club are doing a good job.
Just caught up with Darlo breast clinic campaigners, planning public meetings before Christmas. No dates yet.
@AndyDBCWhittam @Parliament_Week @UKYP @DYPartnership @bycLIVE @DannyBrownMYP have a brilliant day, you look the part!
Chris Grayling indifferent to deaths in custody and violence in jails generally.
Darlington must not tolerate persistently inadequate schools. Darlington academy school rated as 'inadequate' http://t.co/7GuCXEEbCd
@DavidMoyesy think I'll read it before calling for heads on plates
@Bus__23 Court found him guilty, unless he appeals Club has to take the verdict. That's the point of having courts.
@darlostewy @theBretwalda higher standards needed on and off the pitch in my (limited) experience
@MKDarlo @darlostewy football needs higher standards, what can I say!
@darlostewy I think the perpetrators attitude to the offence and victim matter when making this kind of judgement
@Bus__23 nature of crime matters when players are role models, esp for young lads. Also he's expressed zero remorse or sympathy for victim.
@MKDarlo @darlostewy it does as far as returning to certain occupations is concerned. Professional bodies and law prevents it.
@darlostewy I'd take the same attitude if it was one of ours, the nature of the crime matters. Our players are role models.
@Bus__23 there are other jobs he can do, and there are many other professions where such a crime would result in barring
@Bus__23 a successful appeal would change everything
@chrisg0000 if it's true he should apologise
@chrisg0000 oh no, what I miss?
Jessica Ennis-Hill assk #SheffieldUtd to remove name from stand named after her if convicted rapist Evans is offered contract. Good on her.

@CockerBeck @TheNorthernEcho @EchoPeterBarron going to be great, we can do our own Springwatch
@Louisewakefiel4 just had update, seems planning not granted and residents have until 5th Dec to object. Far from done deal.

@andrewpercy if 20% of my constituents signed a recall petition I think I'd probably recall myself, but thanks!
@andrewpercy agree, shame the Government's proposals so lame to begin with. David Heath's ideas may get support though.
@andrewpercy I did support it, but having listened to the debate understand why others had doubts. Hoping for another opportunity at Report.
Hardly the third sector opportunity Government promised with 2 companies  getting majority of contracts http://t.co/jJVRkgRpcb
@daveyrich62 @Napo_News all about the contracts sadly
@andrewpercy now now, plenty of pro-recall MPs voted against amendment as not happy with detail

@Eddielewis83 yep, sorry, it's EE not Everything Everywhere. Or Orange.
Doing first MPs surgery at Everything Everywhere this afternoon.

Not life changing but getting new bin on Falmer Road following our Bank Top walkabout. Also 'Love Where You Live' campaign coming soon.
@Andrew_S_Hatton I've led most of the debates we've managed to get, Government had to be dragged to all of them
@Andrew_S_Hatton @johnmcdonnellMP can't disagree with that
@Andrew_S_Hatton @johnmcdonnellMP indeed, delay is best and pretty much only realistic strategy
@Andrew_S_Hatton @johnmcdonnellMP 'real parliamentary control' of the Government needs Lib Dem and Tory rebels, they had chances.
Checking out the back lanes of Bank Top earlier, had my eyes open for some of it honest! https://t.co/Mwq2SZ5vie http://t.co/AWydW1ZexA

@Run_Dolly_Run @mike1974king it's outrageous. If anyone knows her and she's feeling better get her to contact me.
@LouiseBaldock @jwgsharp there you go, that's because you're serious about winning I suppose
@jwgsharp  I've lived in Darlo for 33 years, and not calling for his resignation just a bit taken aback
@emvbaker @SadiqKhan @Andrew_SelousMP I agree, these attacks should not be treated as inevitable part of prison life
@emvbaker @SadiqKhan @Andrew_SelousMP ...this attack as seriously as if it had taken place on outside
@emvbaker @SadiqKhan @Andrew_SelousMP shameful and predictable, will be felt by all in the service. Police and CPS must treat...
@Craigrobinson fair point
@jwgsharp oh no, not at all, very happy for him to keep his!
@CameronBrownUK @pmcuthbertson attack's a bit strong, just observing and expressing surprise, I think that's justified
@LeeXMartin and you!
@jwgsharp I know, distinct lack of foresight from parents not being in Darlo day I was born
@LeeXMartin no, just someone sent me a link to a London paper with a piece about him, I'm sure he's lovely
@andydixon2002uk we're going to get heads together and put some more energy into this, no magic wand but sure there's more that can be done
@jwgsharp @LouiseBaldock sure, and she can fight her own battles, but she's a longstanding representative there. This guy only elected May.
@LeeXMartin @REWearmouth Lee, you need to calm down, I'm not making a big issue of it, I'm just surprised.
@REWearmouth @LeeXMartin seems odd to me, there are some perfectly capable Tories in Darlington they could have picked #theircall
@LeeXMartin @REWearmouth don't be touchy now
@andydixon2002uk it is. Main issues are takeaways and fly tipping from high turnover rentals I'm told.
@LeeXMartin @REWearmouth not trying to be negative Lee, just surprised. I'm sure he appreciates you covering his back while he's away.
@LeeXMartin @REWearmouth if he thought that was likely he'd resign it now
Hold on, it turns out the Tory candidate for Darlington is a Councillor in London, only just elected in May. What??!

@tpk77 they're free in parts of UK the Tories don't run
@LabourLola you mean Clacton don't you
@Darlotoon so the question is, if not via a Regional Assembly, how do we want power devolved? To Councils? A Minister for the North East?
People of the North, are we still right to think we don't want our own regional assembly? If so, how else can we devolve power?
@LabourLola just adds to the excitement. See you at conference?
@LewisAtkinson @lukeakehurst @hopisen I think it will have more success if not conducted on twitter on a Friday night
@LewisAtkinson @hopisen @lukeakehurst shouldn't have to go through all that just to get a monopoly operator to cross subsidise routes!
@LewisAtkinson @lukeakehurst @hopisen disagree, bus companies hold all the cards

“@DarlingtonBS: Good to meet @jennychapman today. Common interest in supporting the people of #Darlington” thanks, I like your ideas
@andydixon2002uk @darlingtonbc bit harsh! But I'll look out for your letter.
@simonburrows23 that's my fear too, but only way to stop that happening is to get stuck in
@JeffGazzard @hammersmithandy @UKLabour up until last week I'd have agreed with you

@Eddy39 @CraigFarlow nope, just a Darlo mam who voted against the reorganisation and campaigns to keep our local services
@CraigFarlow @Eddy39 agree with that completely, Darlo people care about Scotland too, or so they told me on doorstep in Cockerton last week
@Eddy39 @CraigFarlow although we all like to think we're indispensable, the people of Darlington have managed without me for 3 days

@mymbletroll @JustJonC only another year until there's another vote. Have I ever mentioned what a great councillor Lara would be?.....
Not that the eyes of the world are on it but Labour came 33 votes shy of winning Mowden from the Tories. If you know Darlo you'll get it.
It's that time on polling day when the local MP realises she still hasn't voted.

Going to be trying life as a partially sighted person in Darlington today with help from RNIB.
@DarlingtonBiz possibly...is that an invitation?
But still they could be Tier 2 or 3 provider of probation services and run new prisons, even before SFO finished investigation.
So G4S is paying back £109million to MoJ after it overcharged the tax payer.

Thought putting Cameron's brewery in a piece on alcohol misuse was a bit unfair, it's a quality beer producer.
Oh I do love a young lad with a guitar sounding a bit 60s Paul Simon on #marrshow.  We'll see.
Eric Pickles confirms Govt will abandon flooded communities because 'villages have been getting abandoned since medieval times'. #marrshow
Assessing whether climate change cause of flooding does matter, but not according to Eric Pickles #marrshow
Eric Pickles new role, a round peg. Admits Government wrong and slow in response to floods #marrshow
This week David Cameron refused three times to rule out cutting top rate of tax again from 45p to 40p. I wonder why.
If it's ectoplasmic manifestations now I'm putting the kettle on #marrshow
@RachelReevesMP totally on it, brain the size of Canada she has
@RachelReevesMP 'no one should be better off on benefits than in work' #marrshow
Richest 1% get a tax cut while real terms wages down £1,600 for the rest.

@miketually yes, have raised it previously, amazing what 6th form colleges achieve with what they get
@ChasingTrails @miketually I'm sure the parents are very happy with what they've paid for, but interesting all the same
@miketually I know, but still 39% of those entered getting A* and A in English compared to Carmel's 49% makes you wonder.
Ok doubters, it's Polam 61.4%, Carmel 90%, Hummersknott 71%, Haughton 63% and Hurworth 83% pupils with 5 A*-C GCSEs
@momajtodd @feedthedrummer taken into account
@JohnBroggio @feedthedrummer have checked
Haughton, Carmel and Hummersknott all with more pupils gaining 5 A*-C including English and Maths than Polam Hall. Just saying.
Worth noting half the secondary schools in Darlington out performed the only private school in town at GCSE in 2013.

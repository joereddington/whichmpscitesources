I've been on Procedure Committee for 5 years. Government's sneaky plot to ambush the Speaker today is 100% personal. Thu Mar 26 08:51:28 GMT 2015
Last thing Parliament needs is a Speaker chasing votes, not wanting to upset MPs for fear of being ousted. Sometimes MPs need telling. Thu Mar 26 07:37:34 GMT 2015
Tories in full on nasty party mode today with plot to remove the Speaker. It's vindictive, sneaky and personal. Thu Mar 26 07:30:42 GMT 2015

Most interesting moment of the Miliband interview was when he dissed Tony Blair. A touch of venom there. Thu Mar 26 22:33:23 GMT 2015

@DPTomDavidson on the other hand, that could warm him up more Thu Mar 26 22:06:09 GMT 2015
Not sure it was fair for Miliband to have a warm-up with the audience. But will it matter? Thu Mar 26 22:04:23 GMT 2015

Barnstormer of an address by PM to Parliamentary party this evening. Everyone fired up for #GE2015. Wed Mar 25 17:40:17 GMT 2015
Miliband pulled a dead rabbit out of the hat on VAT and then gave the game away on National Insurance. Di-sas-ter. Wed Mar 25 12:53:22 GMT 2015
As PMQs go, this was a particularly important one. Miliband completely flopped. Prime Minister was on song. End of story. Wed Mar 25 12:47:50 GMT 2015
Where does Miliband go after that?  # Wed Mar 25 12:43:28 GMT 2015

Of course, if Miliband had anything about him, and cared about his Scots candidates, he'd tell Salmond to stick his support. But will he? Wed Mar 25 06:39:19 GMT 2015

Of course, if @ConwyCBC hadn't got in such a mess over @PorthEirias, council tax mightn't have to go up so much. Thu Feb 26 08:26:29 GMT 2015

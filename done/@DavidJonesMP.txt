@NWalesDragons fine, thanks. Let me know if I can help.

I'm not sure it's wise for a deputy in trouble to take a swipe at the man who gave him the seat at the top table. Looks mean spirited.
#Ruthin is carving out a strong reputation as an excellent place to eat; the town is looking good, with an air of confidence.
Nice lunch at @Anniesruthin; always packed, always welcoming
I have written to @ConwyCBC urging them to remove the #Ravilious murals from #ColwynBayPier to prevent them suffering further damage
@ubrianis @caravaggio12 I'm pretty sure that that is the agenda

@WeeklyNewsBay of course; it's the North Wales riviera

Look forward to seeing the Cameron - Miliband leadership polling figures after that speech.
Tax cuts for low paid and middle income earners.  Good, Conservative stuff.

@delythmeredydd what would you say is the principal reason for that?

@richards_les good morning, A!
@DBanksy @DrEvanHarris so in that case Mirror would have to show it investigated all the journo's prior actions against the PI test.
@DBanksy does anyone know who the freelance is (apart from the Mirror, of course)?
@DBanksy but that's an integral part of the story here
@DBanksy and has it a duty to enquire into the circumstances in which the story was obtained?
@DBanksy and if it did know?
@DBanksy if the newspaper can hide behind the freelance's status, it seems unfair on a complainant
@DBanksy what action is available against the freelance?
@DBanksy ah, my point exactly!
@DBanksy but wasn't the freelance trawling MPs generally rather than targeting one in a sting?
@DBanksy what are your views on the ethical position here, David?
New policy for defined pension schemes absolutely right. If you've saved it, you should be able to pass it on to your family.

Arrived at Birmingham; a good, buzzy city with an optimistic feel to it.
@fmbuilders @CPRE @HomesforBritain not happening in Wales, sadly. Welsh regulatory regime increasingly restrictive.

@faytryingtotri no, it's a beautiful morning here

So, it's another morning and so there's yet another person on @BBCr4today who begins her sentences with "so"
@owen131pat @ConwyCBC and that's why we held the meeting
@owen131pat @ConwyCBC we need a lot more positivity in the Bay; let's at least give it a fair hearing
@owen131pat @ConwyCBC don't know; sincerely hope not
@WeeklyNewsBay @ConwyCBC problem is, they do such a lot of their business in secret.
@WeeklyNewsBay @ConwyCBC well that's a relief. If they'd told you that sooner, it'd have been so much easier. Still awaiting FOI replies.
@WeeklyNewsBay what have you got wrong then, Tom?
If @ConwyCBC can't see the potential benefits of the #ColwynBay tidal lagoon, it's a very sad day. I shall continue to take an interest.

Unbelievable complacency from Miliband on @BBCr4today about Labour's dismal failure on health in Wales.  Judge him on that.

Meeting #ClwydWest CFers this weekend; if you're interested, drop me an e-mail
I mean, how could a Labour leader forget the economy?  On second thoughts, I suppose there are a few precedents...
I take it that Burnham will today be explaining how Labour would run the NHS differently in England from the way they do it in Wales
Seems Miliband forget passage in his speech that says how he’d reduce the deficit. Speaks more eloquently than anything he actually said.
And if anyone believes Labour really would benefit the NHS, they should take a look at what they've done to it in Wales.
In deciding to focus on core vote, Miliband has turned his back on rest of the country; v telling that only Unite think speech "visionary".
Very pleased and proud that @cisite has agreed to be a key member of our campaign team
@ToshFan44 either we absndon it or learn from mistakes. Latter more realistic.
@ToshFan44 only if it's done wrongly
@ToshFan44 if it's admirable, then it's surely sustainable. Everyone wants decent healthcare.
Excellent meeting of Clwyd West Association executive tonight. A good, strong, united team.
Blaming a poor speech on the width of the hall is a bit like a poor swimmer blaming the width of the pool.
Any new devo settlement must enshrine right of Welsh patients to timely crossborder healthcare. They've every right to decent treatment.
@eilirjones it's really good right now. Very positive thing for the town, as is the redevelopment of the Rothesay hotel.

The turbines at @PorthEirias are not presently feeding electricity into the Grid
Cost of electrical upgrades and substation at @PorthEirias estimated at circa £55k. Work expected to start toward end of year.

@Porridge defence is a reserved matter
@JozefKPilsudski who lied then?
@jclements61 well good luck with that one. What sort of odds?
If Balls is willing to support unfairness for England (and Wales) he must accept Labour will do worse in England (and Wales) at #GE2015
@Porridge they dont
Balls should just admit: it's thoroughly unfair for Scots MPs to vote on English and Welsh affairs. That's the starting point for fixing it.
Don’t forget: public meeting today, 22 Sept, St Paul’s church, to discuss proposed #ColwynBay tidal lagoon. Important issue for the town.

It is the "unforeseen interconnection of issues" that has led to our dog's breakfast of a Welsh devo settlement.

@GarethJAnderson its farther than London
A too Cardiff-centric approach means that North Wales gets a worse deal on health, the economy and education. Change essential.
In the debate over devolution, I hope all North Wales MPs will work together to get a better deal for our region, which currently loses out

@karlmccartney principally because most of the travel demand is west-east. That's the way trade flows.
@HulbertMathew oops, sorry
@HulbertMathew oh are you one of them?
@HulbertMathew look at the dynamics of coalition. Tory reforms constantly impeded by Lib Dems.
North Wales could be more prosperous, more dynamic if devolution properly recognised its unique identity. The current settlement doesn't.
And calling for fairness for England is entirely justified. But we need fairness for Wales - particularly our forgotten North Wales - too.
Good to see Labour's devo mess dissected in today's broadsheets. It's got to be fixed; but fixing it won't be easy and mustn't be rushed.
Looking forward to Labour clarifying its position on West Lothian question this week. Can't try to hoover round the elephant in the room.

Addressing democratic deficit won't be easy.  Not just a case of English votes on English issues. Some "English" issues affect Wales, too.
Truth is that Welsh devo needs addressing not because of #indyref but because the GOWA settlement is not fit for purpose.
Important that any new Welsh devo settlement should be got right; we don't want to repeat mistakes of Blair's rushed, botched legislation
Looking forward to the ceremony declaring #Abergele a #FreeTrade town on 24 September
Today has been a momentous day. Time to move forward.
Salmond right to go. Couldn't have realistically taken forward devo discussions.

@eilirjones gwenud fy ngorau!
Miliband's "Change doesn't end today; change begins today" is, in a truly, deeply meaningful sense, completely meaningless.
@eilirjones that's why I'm focusing on Wales!  Must not be sidelined.  Must have something better than what we have now.
@eilirjones just interested to know how much responsibility he takes.  Has to address it.
I take it Salmond will be saying something about his own position?  Not going to leave the issue hanging in the air, surely?
@DPJHodges Not so; he has a position, just daren't state it
And new devo arrangements must give proper weight to  concerns of the people of North Wales.  Look forward to cross-party alliance on that.
Whatever replaces GOWA must be something very different from the sterile, timid rubber-stamp for Welsh Labour that we  have at present.
That's why I love politics.  #indyref over.  Now focus is making British devo arrangements better and scrapping disastrous Blair model.
@lojodallas @OcuMelUK yes, I agree entirely. Another reason to look carefully at next devo settlement.
@adrianmasters84 he really said that?  Honestly?
@lojodallas @OcuMelUK if you're in my constituency, please e-mail me
@DavidHansonMP and, as you know, I fully agree!
Welsh settlement should reflect realities of life in Wales, such as dependence on English public services.  Intelligent drafting called for.
Devolution settlement should not be tweaked; Govt of Wales Act needs to be shredded and rewritten.  Carefully.
Farage being uncharacteristically opportuniston @BBCr4today
@Mike_Fabricant @simonharley do feel free; no copyright asserted
Not just fairness for Wales; fairness for North Wales, too long overlooked
Looking forward to being at the heart of that debate!
@Mike_Fabricant strange, I just said that!
That was last night. This morning I'm at launch of N Wales Cancer Network Patient Forum's new website. Important stuff.
@pworz I'd agree that North Wales is not properly recognised in the current devo settlement. It's very South Wales centric.
@DavidHansonMP morning to you!
@DavidHansonMP with a capital L?
@kevwright1 I'm criticising the implementation
@ShippersUnbound I'd say we need someone who has a positive vision of a new United Kingdom. That ain't Salmond.
@LlareggubHall well, you know where to find me!
Given Hain's role in the 1997 devo lash-up, I think he'd do well to remain silent and reflect for a while.
@AGilinsky aw shucks...
@LlareggubHall plenty of room on board!
It's v clear that Tony Blair, back in 1997, set this country on a course that almost destroyed it. Now it's up to Cameron to make it secure.
No resignation from Salmond, then.  Ah, well.
I trust Tony Blair will reflect on the near-disaster his short-termist reforms inflicted on this country.
Salmond to speak soon.  Will he resign?
@Deano_Pentre some should be decided locally, some nationally. That's the way of most modern democracies.
@Deano_Pentre in my experience, Wales is a very different place from Scotland.  Wrong to conflate the two.
And while we're at it, please can we in Wales have a settlement that suits this part of the country?  Present one was never fit for purpose.
Last night's near-death experience a product of Blair's ill-considered devo settlement. Time for measured consideration. No more lash-ups.
For all our sakes, please no more divisiveness. Let’s focus on what unites this country; make it stronger, not try to pull it apart.
Strong No vote in traditional Tory areas gives hope for a resurgence for the excellent @RuthDavidsonMSP and her party

@chriswdrew Chris - you're either in cta or Schengen. Can't be both.
Those in favour of undergrounding the #Clocaenog transmission lines are invited to write to me, if they haven't done so already.
Time for Welsh Government to scrap the appalling TAN8 policy that is wrecking rural Wales #Clocaenog
The #Clocaenog consent doesn't cover issue of transmission lines. I'll be meeting campaigners next week to develop case for undergrounding.
The Welsh Government's TAN8 policy is cited heavily in the development consent letter.  It's a policy that is destroying Welsh landscapes.
Consent to #Clocaenog wind farm is cause for dismay. The turbines will ruin some of the finest landscapes in Wales.
@chriswdrew no, because they'd be in common travel area
Not always that Farage and I are wholly d'accord
Farage right: a "Yes"-voting Scotland would be expected to sign up to Euro and Schengen if it wanted to be an EU member

@VTHolyhead @VirginTrains St Pancras is nice, though; when is Euston going to be brought up to that standard?
@VirginTrains @VTHolyhead your people at Euston were excellent: kind, considerate and efficient. A credit to the company.
@VirginTrains @VTHolyhead stressful for you guys too
@loveandgarbage touch and go though
@VTHolyhead @VirginTrains been a long journey!
@loveandgarbage is Strictly a deal-breaker then?
@VirginTrains regards to the good people at @VTHolyhead
@VirginTrains that's v kind
@VirginTrains bad one tonight (stood from Derby to Stoke) but getting on your train at Crewe was like coming home
After zigzagging across country because of signal failure north of London, how great it is to settle down in the @VirginTrains at Crewe.
@swing_guitars @lucylou432 yes
Important public meeting at St Paul's church, #ColwynBay 7:30 pm 22 Sept to discuss proposed tidal lagoon. Please RT
@ATimEvans presumably, you're commenting from a Denbighshire standpoint, Tim?
@dylanjonesevans yes, and that is clearly what they want to do; no reason why they shouldn't start talking
@dylanjonesevans I think there is clear synergy and they should pursue it

@LaurenMaeve @craigawoodhouse @Peston September's a little early for the Paddington Bear look
What a dreadful summer of conflict it has been; such pain felt by so many people.
@craigawoodhouse @Peston do you really think so?
Is it really that cold in Edinburgh, @Peston?
@HereComesAnna no, I don't think that's the case here
@HereComesAnna one imagines it must be @ConwyCBC, and therefore we do
@HereComesAnna and, sadly again, no end in sight
@HereComesAnna sadly, that continues to be a problem
@mumsieknowsbest if you like Victoriana, you'll love #Llandudno
@gohn first time I've seen him; v good
Presenter of "How Britain Worked" is v engaging; like an 1850s mill foreman cryogenically preserved and revived in 2014.
But still potential for #ColwynBay promenade to rival #Llandudno's.  And #ColwynBay has always had a better beach!
Programme shows #Llandudno pier is still being beautifully maintained. A huge pity #ColwynBay pier has been so badly neglected.
Fascinating programme "How Britain Worked" about #Llandudno on C4 now. What a beautiful building the Pier Pavilion was. What a loss.
Very sorry to hear of the death of Jim Dobbin MP.  A decent, sincere man who was true to his conscience.
@lucylou432 very welcome.
A belting day covering the entire constituency. Dogs, sheep, rams and @john_reaney. What more could you want?
Great evening at @TheatrColwyn.  Many thanks to the entire company. http://t.co/kIdwAQxNWz
The wonderful @john_reaney again. Fantastic voice. http://t.co/8fYm9lrhej
Les Miserables? No, @john_reaney. http://t.co/rbrGGh3qzB
At @TheatrColwyn for a concert in support of.Nant y Glyn church. @john_reaney starring. http://t.co/AMVJqjGqok
@kawgparker @metalartwales I can personally recommend Stuart Williams; superb work
“@metalartwales: http://t.co/RvGHIwnYiJ” the work of a highly inventive master blacksmith
@metalartwales love that, Stuart
So goodbye, summer; looking forward to next year's #SioeCerrigydrudion http://t.co/AC7Bv0gSrn
No goats in #SioeCerrigydrudion, but plenty of sheep: and some tough-looking rams http://t.co/GGj5a3fGkR
The best cupcakes I've ever seen; too good to eat, Caryl! #SioeCerrigydrudion http://t.co/s6Jwor30pi
And the comedy fruit and veg was outstanding #SioeCerrigydrudion http://t.co/kGXsQiGWJh
Excellent standards in the floral competitions #SioeCerrigydrudion http://t.co/UM84F03MYD

Michael Howard right that Schengen countries should get grip on illegal immigration.  France shouldn't regard itself as staging post for UK.
Full day of events in #ColwynBay, including two very important meetings with constituents.
@NewsFrames @WeeklyNewsBay oh dear :)
@Wnicholasgomes William, pleased that @HuffPostUK are taking an interest in #ColwynBay!
@WeeklyNewsBay Tom, are @ConwyCBC still declining to say who is footing the bill for the grid connection?
.@WeeklyNewsBay the CHP system, I think. But connection to the grid should surely have been factored in from the start. Why an afterthought?
@HomeFrontMuseum our office was originally the consulting rooms of a surgeon
@HomeFrontMuseum @JFinchSaunders yes, our part was called Glan Menai.
@HomeFrontMuseum @JFinchSaunders Ministry of Food based at my offices in Trinity Square. Filing racks still there!
Paid several visits to Newport in run-up to @NATOWales; a great city, with a lot going for it.
Am very proud that Wales has hosted such a hugely important event as @NATOWales at such a crucial time in world history. Well done, Newport!
@brianmoore666 @businessdocme @TelegraphMen professional courtesy
@TheLazyWomble that's the traditional route
Didn't realise the platforms at Euston were so long. The train to Bangor is parked just a couple of miles to the South of Watford.
Labour party now out of power in Wrexham.  New grouping of independents taking over.

I'm chairing a meeting on 22 Sept to discuss the proposed tidal lagoon in #ColwynBay.  V important issue for the town. Please RT.
@pworz what are they for?
@cazfilbee05 @ConwyCBC @PorthEirias we need to establish first that it is £200k and that council paying for it
@jazzbeardie @ColwynBayWales we need to depedestrianise Station Road. The town centre is being stifled.
@cazfilbee05 @ConwyCBC @PorthEirias I think that questions needs to be directed at the council, not me!
@dwrj87 @PorthEirias especially since they could just be answered
@adrianmasters84 well I hope you have brought your sarnies
@dwrj87 @PorthEirias right!  It'd be easy to clear this up. All we need is an answer to the Weekly News's question.
@CarolWeston9 but we need an explanation, don't we?
@CarolWeston9 shine a light. Which is what I'm doing.
@WeeklyNewsBay @RedLionOC @dplabergele you get all the good gigs
.@NeilShone1 @ConwyCBC well, the people won't put up with it any more
@KyleButcher thank you Kyle!
.@NeilShone1 @ConwyCBC I believe it's already been submitted. But why don't they just tell us?  Why is everything a secret?
Delighted that Mount Pleasant school, Newport, was able to host @David_Cameron and @BarackObama.  A day the children will never forget.
Point 2 from Weekly News report: has @PorthEirias really been running on a backup generator?  Please may we be told?
Point 1 from Weekly News report: Why won't @ConwyCBC say if they have to pay for the work?
Porth Eirias: More than £200k to be spent on new substation as costs spiral http://t.co/VwC8zOYF9U
@dwrj87 good job I tweeted then!
Will be chairing a meeting at #ColwynBay on 22 September to discuss the proposed tidal lagoon.  Important issue for the town. Please RT
Getting heavy in the House
The deliberations of  the leaders at @NATOWales are of crucial importance to our world.  We should wish them wisdom, foresight and resolve.
Raised issue of proposed #ColwynBay tidal lagoon at DECC questions. Minister confirmed he looks forward to working with me on the issue.

2/2 have had worst made up claims removed. Still much 2 disagree about in articles but thanks to DM 4 sort of admitting they were wrong
1/2 Following complaint by me to Daily Mail, DM have acknowledged that I am not calling on govt to ban cars and online articles about me /
@hocwatch @Independent @afneil 2/2 but even then everyone wd 'own' and drive cars just the same. Have NOT called for cars to be banned.
@hocwatch @Independent @afneil 1/2Have NOT said that. Said in v long term, if country moving to gridlock thought be given to leasing cars/
2/2 Suggested long term change in financing car use from mainly upfront purchase to leasing. That's all. Mail continues to make things up.
1/2 Let's be clear: I am not in favour of banning cars, stopping people driving them or forcing people to join car clubs.
@a_Londoner Just wrong. Do not want to ban anyone from using or having a car, or everyone forced to join car clubs. Mail making this up.
@theresecoffey suggesting long term change towards individual car leasing not up front purchase. That's all. No ban, no forcible car clubs.
@StephenLees4 @MailOnline 2/2 and a poss change from individual up front purchase to leasing. No ban on use etc. Please read piece I wrote.
@StephenLees4 @MailOnline 1/2 Yes I do. Have never said people shd be forced to join car clubs. Talking about long term change to car use/

@monneng @emilygosden 2/2 So includes unabated and new build coal? (12gw?) And btw not going to get all capacity cvd in one 2018 auction.
@monneng @emilygosden No ones suggesting all new build. But puzzle for me is: DECC 2030 projection up to 41gw gas (new and cont.) 1/2
@monneng @emilygosden 2/2 Do sums. DECC central scenario (on 100gms) is up to 41gw new and cont. gas 2030. 12gw new coal? Don't think so.
@monneng @emilygosden no-one suggests 53gw new build. But capacity mkt aims to fund both new build and contin. gas. 1/2

@TheFracDoctor @pete_v 2/2 2 qs in piece.Shale low carbon? no. Do we need top end shale projs when gas use falls in all sectors to 2030? no
@TheFracDoctor @pete_v 1 /2 Not entirely of course: but dist heating, biogas, solar thermal, Heat pumps etc PLUS efficiency make big dent
@TheFracDoctor @pete_v 2/2 DECC energy and emissions projections (Annex C) show gas use down 20% or more 2008-2030 in all other sectors.
@TheFracDoctor @pete_v 1/2 Doh! That's because I was discussing gas as electricity producer. Same principle applies in other sectors tho':/
Cameron says shale is "green energy". Well no it isn't actually. http://t.co/bQn0DHPId8

Ludicrously optimistic estimates of well productivity means far less water and waste than wd happen if realistic estimates used.
Hmm (2) 1/2 Each well needs same amount of water to frack (and same amount of waste) regardless of eventual productivity/
Hmm. AMEC shale report assumes that each of 1440-2880 wells to produce 12% Uk gas will be among most productive found anywhere in world.

So how many shale wells will be needed then? http://t.co/bQn0DHPId8

@richonlyinname 2/2 Not generalised obligation to supply - after all else exhausted. Quacks and walks a bit like SR
@richonlyinname 1/2 Well yes.Utils put plant into mothballs=narrowing of capacity gap:SBR pays utils to take them out when margin difficult
@david_joffe @richonlyinname  A bit self-promotional but here's some detail on how that link was made http://t.co/6v99y1Ha0w
@richonlyinname And read next line 'this means..new investment will be needed to build new plant'. Assume refers to Treas. 37gw not DECC 26
@AlanSimpson01 Yes: much of 22gw outside FITs bracket in levy control cap and in mainstream CfD allowance. Diff. to see how that works!
@richonlyinname ..but DECCs plan to contract additional reserve from  mothballed plant would: but tha'ts strategic reserve so can'tbe right!
2/2 Not a creeping 'strategic reserve', surely?
1/2 DECC energy infrastructure:  says that nat. grid may 'contract for additional reserve in the form of currently mothballed [gas] plant'.
Levy control 'cap' 2015-16 Â£4.3bn. Only allows Â£700m for new entrants. Way off what will be needed if 2020 deployment ranges are to happen.

SERA Agm agrees that  'only a move to a low carbon future will provide the jobs and economic security our country needs' quite right!
New Tory cand. for Corby and E. Northants thinks she's standing for N. E. Hants apparently. Happy to assist during her stay in the south!
@ELNVicky Maybe not got the hang of tweeting sarcasm! I'm just sure that diehard antis will have some off the wall reply at the ready...
Serious peer reviewed report says that Wind turbines are v good reliable low carbon. Something wrong here, surely?

Why re-skilling for a greener economy isn't an optional add on: my speech on the Skills for Climate Change Project http://t.co/W0S4dzsD
@TimProbert  2/2 ...eg green tax redefn, random coalition stuff in EMR while reality (gas, Levy cap, end of CESP/CERT) goes in opp direction
@TimProbert 1/2 Hens not roosting yet but misleading rhetoric is. Keeping coalition agreement WORDS alive now priority ...
And btw Nick Clegg in speech says he wants Electricity Market Reform decisions 'based on evidence'. Should be interesting.....
Problem:  Nick Clegg probably believes all this and is why no action to sort out Treasury/DECC mess is likely: but look at evidence Nick!
New Nuclear: A Programme on it's Knees? (my latest article for New Ground) http://t.co/BdjTKWa3
@doug_parr  there WAS a wood waste consult. 2010. Govt then said 'not minded to ban' . Better luck this time! Ideally, just get on with it.
We've now got Treasury's gas policy in place- not DECC's.  A kingdom for a horse? http://t.co/qoLPEN5T
Olympics opening. Just right. Just British.
@JohnyMoz Relevant yes: a panacea: no. RMR will not resolve structural probs in present market s/a vertical integration and price transfer.
Brit Medical Journal Mar 1871 'it is time to claim a fair trial for bloodletting as a remedy'. Still doesnt work -  but is GO a secret fan?
DECC press release sets out new RO bands and then randomly sings praises of gas for three paras. Faustian pact sealed, I'm afraid.
And we now know why Treasury refused to appear in front of Select Cttee. Would Chloe have let the cat out of the bag?
Official press release from Energy & Climate Change Committee slamming the Draft Energy Bill http://t.co/pblIk8Q8

Minister says that displaced remploy employees will 'have to get jobs'. And where are those, then?
Only 9 remploy factories have 'agreed business plans' Southampton not one and will close. Dreadful lack of justification from minister.

A small rant about the Green Deal and Interest Rates http://t.co/5B1QdUok
....early adoption will be severely affected, and unless there is effective early adoption there will be no Green Deal in the long term.
Bottom line is that the Government is going ahead with #GreenDeal without solving the 'interest rate' problem: and unless it is addressed...

@MartynWilliams2 on reflection....I see your point.
Maybe appearing in front of ECC select cttee instead of on NewsNight would have been a smart move for Chloe
End of long day on Energy Bill at ECC select cttee. Treasury still refusing to appear or even answer letters . A disgrace.
Spoke tonight at CBT 'Feebate' mtg. Gd way to reach 2020 target 1.7m u. low carbon cars. Chelsea Tractor drivers may disagree.
@lizzyfa ...and would like to meet up with your new team asap. Sounds like a Very Good Thing.
@lizzyfa Sorry to hear about your mum. My condolences.Apols for poor reply record: still trying to work out how this thing functions
Spoke at#W2Ecitysummit this am. Clear that biomass projects also caught up in RO/CfD switch. Adds to case for RO extension till 2020.
@davetimms Yes. But that is a 'consultation'. They cd still decide that throwing Â£s at early adopters may not be in long term interest of GD
At Dods round table on green deal. What will DECC do with Â£200m priming money? Why not give to local authorities to help them gear up?

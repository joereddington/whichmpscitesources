.@ToryTreasury you've not answered my question. You're in charge. Why allow this abuse until October 2013? Can you account for yourself now.
.@ToryTreasury ok then. When I asked your Minister if had view about benchmark regulation in March'12, why did he give one word answer "no"?

Cameron's claim on tax cuts in Times are worse than dodgy - the Budget Red Book say he's INCREASED taxes by £23bn including massive VAT rise

"Real tax cuts you show how you are going to pay for them. Where you have unfunded tax cuts they are a tax con" George Osborne, Nov 2008
Time that Osborne came clean on whether £7bn cost of unfunded tax commitments will go onto VAT - I've written to ask: http://t.co/dOJ68IFaAp
. @ToryChairman that's not what you said on Thursday! No offence, but we'd rather hear it from Chancellor; he's got track record raising VAT
Cameron used to say "if you’re going to cut taxes you’ve got to show where the money comes from." What's changed? http://t.co/i0Wl87LvlC
Shapps refuses to rule out raising VAT to fund Cameron's tax policy. They've done it before and they'd do it again..  http://t.co/RhakyRHUqE

Cameron April 2010: "We have absolutely no plans to raise VAT".
So now we know why Tories don't want independent validation of spending & tax commitments.. That's why they've muzzled the @OBR_UK #unfunded
Should we be surprised? George Osborne chooses to give richest 1% a £3bn tax cut while hitting tax credits which make work pay #ForTheFew

MT:<@RicHolden:@Ed_Miliband is playing politics when he should be thinking about national interest>> Oh dear, misjudged tweet from CCHQ here
So OBR say Osborne over-estimated yield from Swiss tax loophole in Budget... Surely he wouldn't have exaggerated?! #moreholesthanswisscheese
.@liambyrnemp -How true: "There is now private joke in Whitehall. To err is human. But to really foul things up you need Iain Duncan Smith."
Want to know the cost of 3 lost years of economic growth for the UK? Just look at how far off track Osborne is on deficit reduction...
More Tory failure on deficit reduction in today's figures; borrowing RISES in first 4 months of year compared to last year #torycomplacency
ONS confirm that banks & wealthy waited for Osborne's millionaires' tax cut before April bonus bonanza #sameoldtories http://t.co/xjDEb11LLv

Carney right to deliver indictment of Osborne's record; now we need Chancellor focused on jobs growth & living standards #costoflivingcrisis
On BBC2 #newsnight tonight, I'll be discussing David Cameron's record on living standards and prices outstripping wages #costoflivingcrisis
To get to where Osborne expected economy would be by 2015, we need growth of at least 5.3% this year and next year #stillfallingshort
Cameron and Osborne need to achieve at least 1.3% growth each quarter until election to catch up lost ground since 2010 #stillfallingshort
After three wasted years, some growth is long overdue. But not keeping pace with Osborne's initial expectations  #stillfallingshort
Today's figs show exactly same borrowing for last 3 months as for same 3 months in 2012.What happened to deficit reduction? #sameolddeficit
.@sajidjavid You've got a cheek, on the day underlying borrowing RISES £500m because economy stalled. Focus on growth, Sajid #sameolddeficit
Well done @leoniemathers selected to stand for Labour in #Sherwood constituency. Great candidate & countdown to victory in 2015 begins now!
It's official: Cameron & Osborne have hit the less well-off more than richest. So much for 'all in it together'!  http://t.co/b34IckzUNR

On @BBCNewsnight this evening to debate why Osborne's failure to kickstart the economy has landed us with more cuts - but a rising deficit.
Osborne is CUTTING capital infrastructure by 1.7% from 2014-15 to 2015-16 (PSGI fig on p11 table 2 of Spending Round doc). #bungle
MT"@SamCoatesTimes Since June12, day announced Hester's departure, value of gov't stake in RBS has dropped £3.98bn"> Result of confused plan
Osborne's cartoon spending review; trouble is, he's in reverse as deficit ROSE last year #comical #wrongdirection  http://t.co/DxeFyECTLO
So after all his claims about the deficit, it turns out borrowing ROSE last year compared to year before. Not a good look, George.. #bungled
Tomorrow's event to support British tennis is shaping up nicely under the shadow of Big Ben in Westminster #tennisis

Claim by @sajidjavid in Commons that Treasury had nothing to do with Hester's departure seem to be rapidly unravelling... #RBS
Challenging the Minister shortly in the Commons on shambolic strategy for RBS, with Hester's departure yet no successor in place.

Discussing need for action on corporate tax avoidance with @SkyNews #Murnaghan at 11.30. Time the Treasury made reforms we need.
After LIBOR, I asked about oil benchmarking in Financial Services Bill debate "why do we not take this opportunity to deal with the issue?"

Staggered by this story about Tory Minister - is he really handing out loaves to the poor from his mansion window?! http://t.co/RlrwWNc3z4
So impressed with staff & volunteers working at @Emmanuel_house_ day centre in Nottingham this morning; a vital lifeline
.@gregclarkmp we've heard those promises before eg, OBR Nov2010 (table4.6 p91) said bank levy would yield £2.3bn in 2012 (actual = £1.6bn!)
@PatJHennessy quite right! In the heat of the tweet...
.@gregclarkmp And you're bank levy raises £2.5bn a year does it?! Nowhere near that. Tut tut - your nose is growing...
Lending to firms still falling - despite 'project merlin', then 'credit easing', so now it's 'Funding For Lending 2.0' Let's hope it works..
Still think Osborne has a 'deficit reduction plan'? At this rate, debt will be £25 TRILLION by time they balance the books - in 400 years...
How's Osbornomics affecting his deficit reduction promise? #howlongwillittakegeorgeosbornetobalancethebooksatthisrate http://t.co/23CenpbSg7
@MichaelSWithers @wdjstraw if you do nothing to foster economic growth, don't be surprised if public finances stagnate #RIPdeficitreduction
@nickhassey @bbcnormans @bbcnews so what happened to Osborne's promise to balance the books by 2015 then? That's just two years to go...
.‏@EdConwaySky Curious about what's really going on with the public finances? Here's my blog on them: http://t.co/qxIIEPyzpf > A 'must-read'

@nickhassey @bbcnormans @bbcnews I'm afraid at this rate deficit still here for 400 years; paying off debt delayed by Osborne til yr 2415..!
.@paulwaugh Are they really proud of these figures?! Reducing deficit by less than quarter of 1percent? #TreasurySpin #RIPdeficitreduction
How embarrassing for Osborne if they don't just admit their deficit reduction strategy has expired #throwinthetowel #RIPdeficitreduction
@mogwaiboy: @ChrisLeslieMP fantastic job you done to day in support of the Defence Fire and Rescue Service> Let's hope Ministers think again
Will Treasury really have the nerve to claim they're still cutting the deficit? It'll take over 400 years at this rate #RIPdeficitreduction
Osborne's failure to grasp that strong economy is key to deficit reduction means at current rates he won't balance the books until year 2415
'Deficit reduction' of less than a quarter of 1% isn't getting the figure down; it's just rounding it down. #RIPdeficitreduction
@PatJHennessy @jameskirkup That's the death of Osborne's deficit reduction strategy; it'll take 400+ years to balance books at that rate!
Incredibly contorted arguments from Govt benches trying to justify different retirement age for firefighters, just because the work for MoD.
It shouldn't take IMF pressure on Osborne to get review of Funding For Lending SME help; we've urged this for months http://t.co/Rsl2A6Ksxr
@Robin_Smith12 perhaps give my office a call on Monday? 0115 711 7666.

Another credit rating 'negative watch' is blow to downgraded Chancellor who made keeping the confidence of agencies his No. 1 economic test.
MT:"@SamCoatesTimes: Osborne only managed to reduce borrowing this yr compared to last by £0.1bn - so delaying items key"> #dodgyaccounting
Didn't Osborne just say he'd achieved double digit deficit? Then admits it's£120.9bn?! #dodgyaccounting #downgradedchancellor #budget2013
Debating #budget2013 on #newsnight tonight. I want to ask Danny Alexander, where has his deficit reduction plan gone? #downgradedchancellor
Growth downgraded, more borrowing, unemployment rising - and millionaires' delighted with mega tax cut in two weeks time #Budget13
OBR forecasting unemployment will rise in 2014 - despite taking account of Chancellor's Budget measures #Budget13
.@Peston and see the small print on OBR p13 about spending "delay" to next year, exposing how Osborne's massaging the borrowing figures
I have tabled a written Commons question to Osborne asking when the Treasury knew of EU bailout proposal & what response they made #cyprus
So Treasury Ministers were aware of Cyprus bailout proposal - but did they caution against it? If not, why not?
Commons Statement shortly on Cyprus bank bailout. Very dangerous for all economies if trust of retail depositors is undermined in this way.
@mrianleslie great news - very many congratulations!
Embarrassing rebuke for PM from OBR; growth HAS been hit by Coalition Next he'll be claiming they're 'paying down Britain's debt' #factcheck
Donations still needed at @advicestanns food bank today - long life milk & tinned ready meals if anyone can donate. http://t.co/VCb4JBQLs0
Dismaying that Ministers are still resisting controls on total cost of ultra high cost credit. OFT report damning about payday loan sector.
Astonishing that Prime Minister protests it's a 'fair room subsidy' and not a "bedroom tax"! Shades of "community charge" vs "poll tax"...
@stellacreasy @RichardJMurphy Predatory lending needs reining in with tougher regulation - no question. Recently met FSA to press this point
.MT "@simondarvill Am so proud to be next national Chair of @YoungLabourUK. Thanks to all who supported me & voted for me #YL13"> Well done!
Time for the Chancellor to get serious about a financial transactions tax - my Guardian online article today. #ftt  http://t.co/urw1CgDcvF
With Tory peers like Lord Forsyth urging Osborne to "change direction", surely the Budget will ditch trickle-down economics & boost growth.?
Cameron says RBS bonuses are sign of "responsibility and restraint"..! £600m bonuses when losses are over £5bn? Restraint?! #outoftouch
Discussing the #AAAdowngrade on BBC News Channel shortly. Any sign of the Chancellor today? #whereisosborne
.@iainmartin1 pre-recorded clip then 'down periscope' isn't adequate; he needs to submit to scrutiny & answer questions #submarinechancellor
Surely the Chancellor will face up to media this morning; not hiding behind @dannyalexander again?! Will LibDems ever learn? #whereisosborne
George Osborne, Aug 2009:  "Britain faces the humiliating possibility of losing its international credit rating" #downgradedchancellor
Worth recalling Osborne's first 'benchmark' test for his own success was "safeguarding the UK's credit rating"...  http://t.co/KXF5bgev5u
Government plans to allow full privatisation of the fire service shouldn't be snuck through a quiet Commons committee http://t.co/fxyu3KSWLJ
They promised to balance the books by 2015, but strip away accounting changes, and the deficit is higher so far this year than last year
Osborne's wheeze with over-estimated 4G proceeds backfires... http://t.co/Jb39REN0
Choice between this Govt & Labour becomes clear; more of same from Tories, or fairer tax system with us. Discussing on Channel4 news shortly
I'll be responding to Treasury statement on banking in the Commons at 1.30pm - yet another day, but still Chancellor not serious on reform.
MT "@patrickjbutler Bedroom tax despair hits media mainstream: Couple break down over #bedroomtax

.@fsb_hq @ChukaUmunna also need to watch that small firms aren't ripped off by claims management companies circling a new 'opportunity'...
.@ITVLauraK and it's worrying the FSA say it may take longer than the six months originally envisaged for compensation to be forthcoming
FSA compensation scheme welcome but it's another example of banks putting profit before customer best interests
Astonishing news from FSA this am that over 90% of sales of interest rate hedging products to SMEs may have breached regulatory requirements
Expecting plenty of issues to be discussed on #bbcdp Daily Politics on BBC2 shortly with @Mark_J_Harper  @afneil @Jo_Coburn including #PMQs

Due on #bbcdp Daily Politics BBC2 shortly to discuss economy and growth
How is the Government doing on growth? Statistics this am show economy is shrinking...again. What did PM say again? #wakeupandsmellthecoffee
@ToryTreasury So borrowing IS higher. Helpful. But you seem to be blaming everyone else.Nothing to do with Chancellor? Blaming the snow yet?
@ToryTreasury do you dislike people pointing out that borrowing is HIGHER? is it uncomfortable? I'm still waiting for you to explain why...
@ToryTreasury Still waiting on your explanation of HIGHER borrowing.. You don't dispute the figures, do you? Can you account for yourselves?
@adbritton @ThisIsNottm excellent news - I look forward to those regular grillings!

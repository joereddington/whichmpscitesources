@ChrisLeslieMP
The election's getting nearer - and a great response on #labourdoorstep from residents of Westminster Close St Ann's! http://t.co/2rKHVx3Xoz Sat Apr 25 19:02:00 BST 2015
Out and about in Candle Meadow on #labourdoorstep and #nhs concerns coming up time and again http://t.co/ov7fBEfMVT Fri Apr 24 14:33:51 BST 2015
IFS publish damning verdict on SNP plans:"full fiscal responsibility would likely entail substantial spending cuts or tax rises in Scotland" Tue Apr 21 17:08:08 BST 2015
At times this year more than 1 in 4 patients were waiting over four hours at Nottingham's A&E. Time to recruit nurses http://t.co/YhFVwodwYW Tue Apr 21 12:05:03 BST 2015
.@paulmbooker next Nottingham East candidates' hustings at Sherwood United Reformed Church, Edwards Lane from 6pm this Friday 24th #GE2015 Tue Apr 21 11:51:48 BST 2015
Some papers will say anything to stop Labour, whether on Scotland http://t.co/zMVaFdj7bK or slurs about @tobyperkinsmp campaign volunteers Tue Apr 21 11:49:05 BST 2015
Beautiful day out campaigning - street stall in Sherwood, out in Sneinton & door-knocking in St Ann's #labourdoorstep http://t.co/FNEJQLfx4u Sat Apr 18 17:02:32 BST 2015
Will Cameron continue to chicken out of a head-to-head debate now? Ed has proved he has the mettle and the right values to lead the country. Thu Apr 16 21:33:54 BST 2015
Ed Miliband dissects the nonsense of Sturgeon's logic - the only way to get rid of the David Cameron administration is to vote #Labour Thu Apr 16 21:20:29 BST 2015
Ed is right to hold Farage to account for his own stated aim when he said he wanted an "insurance-based system of healthcare" Thu Apr 16 21:16:18 BST 2015
Long Eaton residents worried about NHS under Tories on #labourdoorstep with our Erewash candidate @catkinson80 today http://t.co/ktNsaYMh7B Thu Apr 16 15:20:41 BST 2015
Loads of garden posters starting to go up now - if you'd like one too, drop me an email at chrisleslie2015@gmail.com http://t.co/PZ3E7PyJuA Wed Apr 15 14:31:37 BST 2015
Proud to be with @Ed_Miliband at launch of our manifesto - every policy paid for; not one requiring extra borrowing. http://t.co/dajWPBqCJV Mon Apr 13 18:43:21 BST 2015
Does Osborne's refusal to say how he'd pay for NHS promises EIGHTEEN times break Michael Howard's record with Paxman? http://t.co/8q2qgizTgo Sun Apr 12 15:21:43 BST 2015
If you look closely at latest Tory inheritance promise, turns out it won't affect 90% of families #readthesmallprint  http://t.co/yg4lxBriZO Sun Apr 12 07:59:08 BST 2015
Tories hastily commit £1bn on an inheritance policy that Treasury admit wouldn't apply to 90% of estates! Labour would make fairer choices. Sat Apr 11 23:48:28 BST 2015
At @Stonebridgecit1 family fun day this morning - not sure that lamb was a Tory after all, David! http://t.co/fTJku42FmW Sat Apr 11 12:07:32 BST 2015
Osborne's said he'd DOUBLE pace of cuts next year - so beware these latest panicky, unfunded & hollow promises on NHS http://t.co/iSMX65AKqO Sat Apr 11 07:49:12 BST 2015
As their campaign flounders, watch how these Tories really struggle to defend their embarrassingly unfunded policies https://t.co/URfbUx297c Fri Apr 10 23:32:21 BST 2015
At last some fine warm weather - perfect for #labourdoorstep campaigning with @Nick4Broxtowe in Stapleford today http://t.co/fuQKPsnV0v Fri Apr 10 14:48:53 BST 2015
Tories make more promises again - but they refuse to say how they'd pay for them. No wonder they stopped independent OBR manifesto costings! Thu Apr 09 22:47:10 BST 2015
Well done to all the #nottingham academy @NottinghamAcad students working with @torvillanddean on @ITV this evening !! #icerinkontheestate Thu Apr 09 22:03:01 BST 2015
Non-dom tax loophole needs to end - there shouldn't be special rules for the jet set. Are Tories going to defend it? http://t.co/Q4lEeSMXh2 Wed Apr 08 07:49:14 BST 2015
Tories hoping people forget 5 yrs of tax rises;giving a little with one hand but taking away much more with the other http://t.co/cqEpLyMM6h Mon Apr 06 08:49:47 BST 2015
Ed Miliband wins the debate with the clear leadership, passion and belief the whole country needs - a real agenda for change #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:05:26 BST 2015
Ed sets out big choice at election: more trickle-down from Tories or better plan to include everyone in economic recovery #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:51:36 BST 2015
.@IsabelOakeshott Not sure it's really so smart for Cameron to be saying "never mind zero hours"!! #outoftouch #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:24:55 BST 2015
Totally right for Ed to focus on the epidemic of job insecurity and exploitative zero hours contracts in the economy #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:20:55 BST 2015
Ed takes Cameron apart on his woeful negotiating skills in Europe - no wonder they call him the #invisibleman #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:14:40 BST 2015
Strong point from Ed M: got to tackle unscrupulous employers exploiting migrant workers & undercutting workforce in the UK #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:06:20 BST 2015
Ed details exactly how we get extra doctors and nurses to tackle the longer waiting times to see a GP and the a&e crisis #nhs #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:41:35 BST 2015
Ed right to spell out why Cameron's plan would have a crushing impact on public services #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:28:10 BST 2015
A fair plan where those with broadest shoulders pay a fairer share - the better way to tackle the deficit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:24:10 BST 2015
Too late Nick - you voted for Cameron's roadmap to extreme cuts #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:19:00 BST 2015
Britain succeeds when working people succeed #hereswhatibelieve #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:11:35 BST 2015
.@ToryChairman when the IFS's Paul Johnson says of your made-up campaign numbers "I certainly think it's unhelpful", maybe take the hint? Mon Mar 30 13:48:46 BST 2015
Campaigning steps up a gear now - and we're door-knocking in the Haydn Road area this evening #VoteLabour http://t.co/6gzvYLsLMj Fri Mar 27 18:42:35 GMT 2015
Ed shows passion and the leadership we need - and what a shame Cameron is still too scared to debate head-to-head #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:25:34 GMT 2015
Ed's right: people are £1600 worse off under the tories as real wages have plummeted  #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:14:22 GMT 2015
Cameron says next three years pretty much same cuts - but look how much deeper OBR say they'll be #BattleForNumber10 http://t.co/eCTOEoIznp Thu Mar 26 21:34:03 GMT 2015
Sounds to me like Cameron has deep cuts to tax credits in his sights as part of his agenda #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:16:54 GMT 2015
Govt sneaking out of answering loads of parliamentary questions on last day - just look at this overdue non-answer.. http://t.co/MxBsGITRlJ Thu Mar 26 14:46:35 GMT 2015
Game, set and match Mr #Speaker Thu Mar 26 13:54:36 GMT 2015
Amazing cross party outrage at attempts by Govt to undermine the Speaker - and Charles Walker's speech one of the most powerful I've heard Thu Mar 26 13:08:08 GMT 2015
Such a great event here with @NottinghamCitz at their election assembly - and great to have @leicesterliz here too! http://t.co/U1BQ59uxZ5 Tue Mar 24 20:12:02 GMT 2015
Over 2000 people here at Nottingham's Royal Concert Hall for @NottinghamCitz gen election debate - great occasion! http://t.co/QXgEyYE9KR Tue Mar 24 19:06:50 GMT 2015
On @BBCNewsnight shortly to discuss Osborne's extreme plans for what the OBR call 'a sharp acceleration' in the pace of cuts #sameoldtories Wed Mar 18 22:03:50 GMT 2015
Want to know Tory plans for public services? OBR say cuts 'rollercoaster' falls into 'sharp acceleration' to 2018 http://t.co/gXetONuf9T Wed Mar 18 14:39:30 GMT 2015
MT<< @paullewismoney: Grant Shapps admits finally he ran business as Michael Green while an MP http://t.co/wnmzO3IiST >> oh dear..... Sun Mar 15 19:15:54 GMT 2015
Ready for the launch of Labour's election pledges here in Birmingham with shadow Cabinet colleagues #votelabour http://t.co/bF0z60CtoT Sat Mar 14 11:35:34 GMT 2015
IFS expose Osborne's Budget tricks; give a little away with one hand & take away much more with other #sameoldtories http://t.co/TKen01zWAp Fri Mar 13 16:31:07 GMT 2015
Osborne's cuts agenda isn't about the deficit; it's a desire to shrink public investment year after year to levels not seen since late 1930s Mon Mar 09 08:23:52 GMT 2015
Will @ONS rebuke Osborne for saying on @BBCr4today that "we've got on top of our debts"?! Repeats PM's "mistake"... http://t.co/hEhBIS3KPr Wed Mar 04 09:03:40 GMT 2015
Did Osborne really just say "we've got on top of our debts and deficits"??! Wed Mar 04 08:15:11 GMT 2015
IFS today show that people in work STILL worse off than in 2010 - yet Chancellor tries to spin this as a cause for celebration #outoftouch Wed Mar 04 07:53:30 GMT 2015
Another strong turnout for @leoniemathers campaigning around Calverton in Sherwood this morning #labourdoorstep http://t.co/0TEdqlGu8B Sat Feb 28 11:46:16 GMT 2015
Positive response to Labour's #tuitionfees pledge from Edwalton residents with our candidate @dm4rushcliffe just now http://t.co/dEvrsKYWz4 Fri Feb 27 18:31:50 GMT 2015
Wow. The number of zero hours contracts as 'main job' leaps massively by 19%+ just in past year say ONS.Tory economics in action #failedplan Wed Feb 25 11:14:14 GMT 2015
@gm6016 We should work together to move Cameron out of No10: saving the NHS; better wages;backing the next generation http://t.co/p7dkzi6QEP Sat Feb 21 07:57:54 GMT 2015
Osborne promised in Nov 2010:"we will meet our fiscal mandate to eliminate the structural current budget deficit one year early in 2014-15" Fri Feb 20 11:08:17 GMT 2015
.@michaelsavage that'll be because they got the taxpayer to pay for this banner I suspect #howmuchdiditcost? Fri Feb 20 10:28:24 GMT 2015
Submarine Chancellor still refusing to surface and answer questions about HSBC, Ministers & tax abuse #downperiscope http://t.co/BwAYw32Fy3 Mon Feb 16 20:11:35 GMT 2015

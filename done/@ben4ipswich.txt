@ben4ipswich
Evil auto-correct given me false apostrophe in an education tweet = Twitter death... Groan.
@Geates ha! Quite right.
@Privateallergy deficit has fallen every year of Coalition.
Provisional results show Suffolk is turning round it's GCSE performance. At last going forwards not back. Well done all - now foot on gas.
@davidkenny100 yep - this only brought to me in last few week. Working on it now.
@davidkenny100 in short, gov money up but Suff loses cos Sch reorg plus building inflation means we need Whitehall solution - 140 not easy!
@davidkenny100 complicated because complicated. I expect to sort it out... Involves Whitehall...
@NewbornDavid @CarrickJo ha! Not likely... x
@davidkenny100 working on it - complicated problem but we will get there
@SuffolkNature quite right: meeting this week about it - will write to you shortly.
Today's http://t.co/D4pgEzAkIP word of the day is 'horripilation'. I feel I've missed something not knowing this word till now.
@MarkReckless @PaulGoodmanCH @UKIP what's your position on Lodge Hill today?
More great jobs news from Ipswich: new @Its_MyGo youth Job Centre has taken 91 voluntary registrations in first 2 days - amazing start!
@PeterEastern which is why you build in a contingency...
@stowtom2010 except 3 million more on cleaning and massive refurb of intercity stock...
@PeterEastern £60-£78, with generous 60% optimism bias.
@D_Blanchflower @KarlTurnerMP checked out those unemployment figures today Danny? Quite a long way from 5 million I'd say.
@PeterEastern email me.
@stowtom2010 We're putting right decades of underinvestment. Sorry it's not in time for you.
@PeterEastern the evidence, by the way, starts with the fact that it is supported by SCC, NALEP, UCS, ABP and Ipswich Central.
There are now 30.8 million people in work in Britain - the highest number in our history. An exciting day.
@PeterEastern don't be cross now... please email me and we will sort a time - Fri poss.
@PeterEastern that is why I am pitching for a feasibility study.
@mproberts1977 soon I understand - legislation being prepared. To be clear, we are banning exclusive zero hour contracts.
That's fewer young people out of work in Ipswich than during the height of the boom. This is what a sustainable recovery looks like.
Here's the big news: youth unemployment now lower in Ipswich than since town-specific records began in 2000.
@iBreezeblock soon I believe - legislation being prepared now.
@134grassy @commutism @Delayed_Again @pritipatelmp @ChloeSmithMP @Bob4Colchester @greateranglia almost every day
@RobM1_15 @kingeric1969 @greateranglia £476m investment in infrastructure, on top of £170 already being spent, and new trains.
@PeterEastern come in to discuss - it is a good scheme.
@stowtom2010 we're trying - see our pitch to the chancellor.
@MrSimonYoung just written to you on that!
@timfromdagworth disabled people getting jobs at faster rate than ever before. Much, much more to do though - I agree.
@iBreezeblock we're banning exclusive zero hour contracts. For good.
@andrewbrownnet good news there too: long-term unemployment falling at fastest rate for 16 years. Sustainable jobs for all.
@sandyofipswich we're banning exclusive zero hour contracts and lifting tax for people on minimum wage. Come on, cheer the amazing news!
Governor of the Bank of England: "We are starting to see the start of real pay growth." Expects wages to increase by 3% in 2015.
I'm proud that these record jobs numbers come as minimum wage rising and we are banning exploitative zero hours contracts. #sustainablejobs
Our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
Meanwhile, wages are now rising faster than inflation and the vast majority of jobs being created are full-time contracts.
Long-term unemp. falling fast in Ipswich too - down 5.4% in last month. That's 40 more people jobless for more than a year now back in work.
The number of people claiming JSA in Ipswich now down 42% since the 2010 GE - a reduction of 1,525.
Really magnificent jobs figures for Ipswich: youth unemployment now less than half the figure at the last general election - down 52%.
Unemployment firmly beneath 2 million, 13,000 jobs being created every week in Britain, wages now rising faster than inflation.
Employment up 112k, unemployment down 115k, claimant count down 20,400. Another sign that our #longtermeconomicplan is working
@maxjfreeman she's a nasty piece of work.

Just met a nice man in Rochester who Reckless tried to sign up as a Tory member days before he defected. He was understandably confused!
Congratulations Jo Churchill - delighted to have you on board with #TeamSuffolk
@Jane_Basham btw - Labour peers in Lords yesterday arguing against nationalisation, UKIP for. How funny!
@Jane_Basham I did #hashtagoveruse
@Privateallergy deficit has fallen every year of Coalition.
@Jane_Basham that's it - Dutch State Railways an "oppressive corporation". Is this the best the Lab Party has to offer?
Manufacturing orders are up, despite the headwinds from Europe. We are building a sustainable recovery with secure jobs for millions.
There are 31,770 more businesses in the East of England than since 2010. Our #LongTermEconomicPlan is working.
@NJFaraday it will be
@wallaceme @the_tpa hate to ruin the story but I'm not that assiduous a reader of @ConHome...
@ChrisBryantMP @antonylittle it was in the Budget a few weeks later.
An important day for taxpayers and for democracy: a tax statement for 24 million people, thanks to @George_Osborne
@RevRichardColes I was there at opening of Ealing Bdwy Centre! Can't believe I was in company of @ShappiKhorsandi. #Brushwithfame.
@A_Liberty_Rebel if you want to insult someone, try to use the right words.
@D_Blanchflower @DPJHodges you haven't answered why your *predictions* make you so risible an economist.
@DPJHodges @D_Blanchflower looks like dear Danny being as charming as ever. Poor lamb.
@jean_everson thank you
@Politicsatbest yes pls
@Jessica_Asato @antonylittle @danhoward64 I didn't quote your interview. I did ask Qs tho.
Great initiative from Suffolk's libraries - good to see @suffolkcc's reforms beating fruit http://t.co/FKcTR0kNws
@Politicsatbest can't have been recently - she left a few months ago...
@GavinBarwellMP @CatMcKinnellMP so stunning it reduced the opposition whip to giggles.
@labourlewis wow.
@danhoward64 result of this exchange is that we now have a closer view of how franchise in 2016 wld be delayed by Lab - material to region.
@danhoward64 sorry - but what is childish about my Qs? Vigorous political debate. Big issues, big arguments.
@labourlewis @ChloeSmithMP no need for nastiness - merely flushing out @Jessica_Asato's view. You've been quite clear, thank you.
@danhoward64 these things are important. Billions of investment depend on who wins. That is why these debates are crucial.
@Jessica_Asato @antonylittle @ChloeSmithMP finally, pls confirm commitments from Ed Balls to infrastructure investment in East Anglia
@Jessica_Asato @antonylittle @ChloeSmithMP pls confirm Lab policy to letting new franchise in 2016
@Jessica_Asato @antonylittle @ChloeSmithMP OK - pls confirm conversations you have had with Ed Balls about future Lab gov investments east.
@Jessica_Asato @ChloeSmithMP you've said enough.
@Jessica_Asato @ChloeSmithMP Gotcha.
@Jessica_Asato @ChloeSmithMP ah - so you would delay 2016 franchise while you make new law, meaning we miss out again. As we thought.
@Jessica_Asato @ICA_Suffolk @ChloeSmithMP in wealthier times Labour did nothing for our region. As local MPs we are winning a fair deal.
@Jessica_Asato @ICA_Suffolk @ChloeSmithMP Freudian slip. Precisely the point - no investment when Labour in power. We are putting right.
@Jessica_Asato @ICA_Suffolk @ChloeSmithMP can you confirm - would you prefer state ownership? Important we know.
@Jessica_Asato @ICA_Suffolk would that be praise for @ChloeSmithMP and me also, as it is a joint campaign?
@andrewbrownnet for gov, against Zac - whom I love but he's wrong on this.
Europe is still awaiting its Thatcher moment - another perceptive article from TV's @EdConwaySky. http://t.co/4qwHiNFDdY
@cowperandco @andrewcann @IpswichSpy very little puts pressure on IBC. Except when I say black, which excites them into declaring for white.
@LaLegatron nope
@cowperandco @IpswichSpy @andrewcann former will be a problem; ABP being very constructive.
Depressed by how full the chamber is on #RecallBill - nothing like self indulgence to pack the Commons...
@NewsAnnabelle @Geates @NewAngliaLEP I've given full rights to non-Ni knights.
@PeterEastern well, SCC are supporting this whole-heartedly. This is visionary stuff, so IBC unlikely to understand it.
@SuffolkCoast15 we need major reforms. Full stop.
@patrickwintour that's the spirit Patrick - joyful as ever.
@greateranglia Ipswich. Left at 0813.
@greateranglia 0806 late out of LS. No explanation. Why? What's happening?
@turtill wrong Peter.
@huwtaylor will check why not. Believe recall in some circs a good idea.
@PeterEastern SCC have it in their plan as do LEP. Key to regenerating Island Site. Will give some local traffic benefits.
@austinreeve not at all - some good people in that group I was pleased to see.
@AndiHoppy do get back to me if you have any more Qs. Important issue much overlooked.
@SuffolkCoast15 @theresecoffey @SCTories then you won't get an #EURef
@BigG0dfrey don't agree. But we need to do far more.
@LALALAWRIGHT @SPILL_Festival @pumpandgrindVA I hoe so too! Just going thru programme.
@kingeric1969 trying so hard...! @greateranglia - what is the reason?
@BigG0dfrey @ChloeSmithMP watch this space.
@Tomscrivens1 thank you! Now got to make it happen.
@lpc1793 @BBCLookEast thank you!
@Littledeanydean thank you Dean
@jesterM yes - some very good ones.
@dalancro I'm aiming for quicker than that!
@ClarenceBoyce thanks! Now we need to make its happen.
Want to see my vision for an Enterprise Island and a Wet Dock Crossing? Watch @BBCLookEast
Stuck in Star Lane. We need a Wet Dock Crossing. We need better roads in North of town but town centre traffic will not be fixed without WDC
This kind of story makes me want to ditch all my views on prison reform. How disgusting. http://t.co/D9c3J6Ic8S
A new Enterprise Island: a vision for Ipswich, for growth and new jobs. http://t.co/YrCov6Cxqy
@gilescoren that's not funny.
@gilescoren oi! That's me you're talking about!
@heapd77 glad I'm a spur to hard work.
@SteveMorphew you're wrong and rather sad. Goodbye.
Excited to be launching vision for #EnterpriseIsland @UCS_NEWS with ABP and @NewAngliaLEP and @suffolkcc - aspiration for Ipswich.
@SteveMorphew if you look at the start of this thread, you may understand why I have been robust.
@SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP not afraid of losing - only fearful what Labour wld do to my town and our nation.
Good news on A12: works planned for before Xmas will now only happen at night after 10pm. Thank you @highwaysagency and @transportgovuk
At the phenomenal the amazing first The Suffolk Skills Experience at Trinity Park - come at 1630 for open session if you can. #TSSESuffolk
@RealDC80 correct. But this until they arrive.
@SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP a Lab govt wld however mean no investment.
@SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP on that you are right: what you Tweet is immaterial.
@ferrariman15 @SteveMorphew @bluetractor @Delayed_Again @ChloeSmithMP we are gunning for new and determined to get it.
@ferrariman15 @Delayed_Again @SteveMorphew @ChloeSmithMP correct - we need money for new trains and track.
@shrekky2824 it will be a couple of years longer than that but I am determined to secure them.
@eelpie1 I know - but that is first class. Our refurb will be good too.
@shrekky2824 @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP they do. But before they arrive we want better interiors.
@SteveMorphew @bluetractor @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP wrong again.
@Jojo144 @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP massive investment coming in next 6 yrs. Will take time because so much to do - incremental.
@chris_hill_1981 @ProjectPayback @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP yes - these are coming now.
@chris_hill_1981 too right - and they will be ordered in next 2 years, if campaign succeeds.
@SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP if I were you I'd just keep your peace: we will have investment in this CP.
@bluetractor @SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP new. 2019-2020. If you have a Tory-led govt: Lab will not commit.
For those seeking to leave the EU, this is an interesting picture: http://t.co/PIbsyqKFxi
@SteveMorphew @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP actually not. But don't worry - your out of the loop now so something will happen.
@mproberts1977 correct. NXEA bled franchise dry.
@SteveMorphew @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP actually it's starting now. You shld do your homework before Tweeting nonsense.
@ferrariman15 @Delayed_Again @SteveMorphew @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP too right. We need both.
@bluetractor @SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP new stock will come but this is to make things nicer till then.
@SteveMorphew @Delayed_Again @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP that is precisely what is happening - if we win the GE of course.
@Haideesu yes - I'll ask.
@martincampbell2 it is additional to full amount available now.
@lindarella now?
@SteveMorphew @greateranglia @ChloeSmithMP you clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Silly tribal posturing.
@i_williamson1 @greateranglia no - but it is a start.
2,500 additional seats a day to combat overcrowding.
@Tituca @greateranglia good idea - will talk to MD now.
.@greateranglia spending another £2.2m on cleaning.

@TheBenRamsey @IpswichGov yup
Delighted that @IpswichGov have realised that switching on Xmas lights in the middle of the day is not a great show.
@ayestotheright it'll happen quicker than that...
@askcolinnoble I'd missed that: what a thing to do. And on this anniversary.
@michaelc419 because it was a backbench debate and I am not a backbencher. I support Palestinian statehood.
@LukemCresswell @Green_Adz87 not sure I could be any clearer: I support statehood for Palestine.
@tomfernley I'm afraid I have grave difficulties with the ECHR full stop.
@austinreeve couldn't vote as was Backbench debate and I'm not a backbencher. I support Palestinian statehood.
@LukemCresswell @Green_Adz87 before you rude two get over-excited with wild conspiracies, I cldn't vote as it was Backbench debate.
@tomfernley but gay freedoms given by parliament separate from HRA - same sex marriage for e.g.
This is a remarkable moment - and a very happy one http://t.co/sSRqTRnAwz & http://t.co/u9XfceaBWt
@onefinedayread can't vote in this debate as it's Backbench Debate. Do support statehood for Palestine.
@ShellyDarwin indeed - but that is my job- to lobby. But as you wish.
Bursting with pride at hearing my sister's first outing on @BBCFrontRow just now.
@IsabelHardman grumpy guts
@ShellyDarwin we can speak beforehand if you want, not least so I can feed back what you say.
@ShellyDarwin if you want to come to discuss this I wld be delighted - doing huge amounts on FY in Ips.

@sphenefan I see unemployment down, youth unemployment halved. You should be pleased.
@sphenefan according to the ONS actually.
@sphenefan yep - that'll be inequality narrowing under the Coalition - got bigger under Labour. Believe the left's lies if you will.
We're investing in schools and in skills to provide future security for all in Britain. http://t.co/CuOxFwLKQ9
@LALALAWRIGHT @EADT24 @Visit_Suffolk well done!
Delighted that Jonathan Hill been approved as our EU commissioner: an exceptional and thoroughly decent representative for the UK.
@sphenefan charming as ever.
In honour of #GBBOfinal tonight, the marvellous Katherine P has produced some Tory rosette cupcakes. http://t.co/rFVheTATdX
This to be proud of from the Coalition: the reading gap between children on free school meals and their classmates is now closing.
The number of children adopted has increased by 26% this year - a significant result of the Coalition's wholesale reforms of adoption.
@Aidan_Tynan93 appropriate book next door!
@StAlbansHigh @theresecoffey I'm in Suffolk too - wish I'd known!
@KarlTurnerMP not likely Karl, as you'll remember that NF support was in large part ex-Labour...
One voter: "I'll be voting UKIP as the National Front aren't standing." Blimey.
Campaigning in Weeley for the excellent @GilesWatling
I struggle to believe Top Gear's protests of innocence on H982 FKL. If intended, profoundly cruel to taunt losers in a war, however worthy.

@djdegiorgio you did! See how things can progress...
@Colne_Magna precisely.
@bakerwe @NewAngliaLEP @ITVEmmaH @ChloeSmithMP correct - which is why we're campaigning for better. Will take 6 yrs but we will do it.
@Colne_Magna they'll be similar - but not intended to extend life too long as we want completely new trains by 2020.
@Colne_Magna you'll start seeing refurbed trains in New Year, then rolling programme of improvements to 2019/20 when NIN will be achieved.
The reality of a mansion tax in London begins to bite. http://t.co/tOESf1cgk5
And we're now making good progress on long term unemployment in the town - a long term problem for Ipswich. Down another 3.2% in August.
Youth joblessness now 46.5% lower than at time of 2010 General Election - that's 470 fewer young people claiming JSA.
Belatedly processing Ipswich unemployment figures for August. Good news, again. JSA claimants down almost a hundred in 1 month alone.

@SomeblokeJust @AlexKuczer in protection of life, international law and order, and UK interests.
@AlexKuczer request from sovereign state does not need UN if it is in their airspace.
@roybe of you think about, that hashtag is a bit silly, isn't it.
@Suffolk1953 I think we all know why they have US arms. Obama is no Bush.
@SomeblokeJust hi - I wld not vote for an illegal war. These air strikes wld be requested by Iraq and wld therefore be legal.
@qprdave1234 oh please...
@AlexKuczer the vote is not on Syria - solely Iraq, at request of Iraqi government
@qprdave1234 in what way?
@bignelln thank you!
@RealGeoffBarton the kind of platitudes that gave the kids of Hackney a chance that few in Suffolk enjoy.
@wdjstraw @MrSamHodges @wallaceme you may well laugh but that's what the polls say.
@wdjstraw @wallaceme Lab must face fact that Tory PM now more trusted by Scots than Ed Miliband.
@wdjstraw parties shld serve voters - and your voters so fed up they did precisely the opposite of what you implored them to do.
@wdjstraw given Labour's inability to secure a unanimous No amongst its voters, I'd pipe down if I were you...
@TommyMoseley agreed - and English votes in English laws.
@bignelln at home I'm glad to say: with my 3-day old son - just back from hospital.
@SeemaKennedy thank you Seema!
@lowriser @R_J_Parker that was not the point of a re-Tweet. It is a very interesting analysis that shld challenge us all.
.@alexsalmond you can't criticise differences between Lab and Cons and then claim we're all part of some "West. Establishment". Disingenuous
@elundy1 thank you so much Eddie! It is amazing.

@Morvynf things are getting better
@TonyOli85059459 lol
@lorddeben won't vote - but favoured UKIP :)
@jackmatt81 true. Good that people can now laugh at how ludicrous it seems...
@PXEducation magic
That's a first: just canvassed a self-identified witch.
Ian Paisley - Peacemaker: if only adversaries in other seemingly intractable conflicts could learn from his example.
@IpswichLabour glad to see your really profound contribution to improving Foundation Years provision in Ipswich.
@jameselmer73trn that'll be after we've got all schools over the 'Good' line...
@tonyandcarole well, it's eluded people so far...
@TinyAcorns does. But goes further.
@marcruse lol!
My 20:20 Vision for Ipswich schools on @BBCLookEast now...
My 20:20 vision for Ipswich schools: every school to be 'Good' or 'Outstanding' by 2020.
The inspiring Yr 6 pupils of Ravenswood. They know how to achieve their dreams: we need to do same for our schools. http://t.co/TRnHNCdV0k
So happy to open the new office of @Ivoffshore and meet the great young and ambitious team. The future of Ipswich. http://t.co/auhEKjqBhR
@JaneBasham you may like to look at my timeline to see the kind of person you've been retweeting. No place for language or threats like that
@NickiGarnham i wld like it to happen today too but must recognise scale of the challenge. Took 10 years in e London - so 5 yrs ambitious!
@Cadrieu 1/5 children leaving school unable to read and write is not my definition of perfect. Thank you for revealing your true colours.
@Cadrieu wow. As ever - rather than discuss what we can do to improve children's futures, you revert to insults. Very sad.
@Cadrieu @BBCSuffolk do you share the vision?
About to explain on @BBCSuffolk why I want every school in Ipswich to be Good or Outstanding by 2020.
@BernardMcEldown point still stands - Labour a misnomer...
@BernardMcEldown er - all Labour governments since the War have left office with unemployment higher than when they came in.
@BernardMcEldown 1.8 million - many people previously economically inactive have re-entered Labour market. NS figures...
Delighted by appointment of Jonathan Hill to financial services post in EU Commission - one of many excellent picks by Juncker.
@tomfernley @Siralanhe I will try to get latest figures...
@Siralanhe I hope so too!
@BernardMcEldown they are figures from the NAO. Your denial, I'm afraid, is an untruth. 83% of jobs created are full time.
@Siralanhe so will I
@Siralanhe National Statistics - nothing to do with credibility - it's fact...
@tomfernley @Siralanhe n'wide - was last figure I saw
@Siralanhe also not true.
@Siralanhe Simply not true. 83% of new jobs are full time.
Got an exciting launch tomorrow of the first pledge in my 20:20 Vision for Ipswich.
Let's celebrate again the new jobs in Britain - and the 1,170 fewer people out of work in Ipswich now than in 2010. http://t.co/kIYO8l1mUX
@EdConwaySky because more in ed...
@maxjfreeman cool - pls do - and if you email me I'll give you a detailed answer on Gaza as I've given to others.
@D_Blanchflower read it again, Danny - it was conditional on public spending cuts as well.
@D_Blanchflower we did cut spending, and unemployment did not go to 4 million. That's it - job done.
@D_Blanchflower 'He predicted unemployment would keep rising "well into 2010" probably to around 3.4 million.'
@D_Blanchflower any cuts in public spending could force unemployment up from its current 2.5 million to four million over the coming years.
@D_Blanchflower you're in a parallel universe. http://t.co/XmGYO6H4Sx http://t.co/SGKmXap2dD
@D_Blanchflower do you know, really clever people don't debate like you. As I said, a pointless counterfactual thrown up to distract. Bye.
@D_Blanchflower you really are a rude man.
@D_Blanchflower try not to be patronising Danny. I know what a counterfactual is; you made a prediction.
@D_Blanchflower not sure what that achieves - no one can answer that. The fact is you said unemployment would rise; it has gone down
@D_Blanchflower not at all, but we were talking about joblessness. Got to work now.
@D_Blanchflower there you go again, Danny - resorting to insults. Says it all really.
@D_Blanchflower I am celebrating the huge fall in unemployment and the 1.8m jobs created since 2010.
I am proud that we are getting to grips with youth unemployment - down 45.5% in Ipswich since the election. http://t.co/LNPa9MeCpo
@maxjfreeman you were going to be in touch.
@IpswichLabour nor were you there in force when I opened Ravenswood Children's Centre a few years ago.
@CmdrSpace @stonojnr @Delayed_Again @greateranglia I beg to differ - NXEA were worse but GA are certainly not good.
@Marky_Simmo @stonojnr @greateranglia high speed extra to transport budget - we are getting billions extra here now.
@salter_jo hope you can see a good result now...
@DamienRibbans78 @greateranglia got a meeting with NR chief exec. to sort this out imminently
@JustSomeGuy78 @greateranglia got a meeting with chief exec. soon to sort this out.
@RobM1_15 @kingeric1969 @greateranglia more action than rhetoric, I assure you.
@kingeric1969 @RobM1_15 @greateranglia they are not distinct: we need to fix the trains and track to improve reliability
@andyjb @GoSkyRide @BritishCycling nice to see you too! It was a great morning out.
@SuffolkNature and received - thank you.
@J_VVilson the way they have treated the local community is disgraceful - railroading is a polite way to put it.
@D_Blanchflower charming as ever, Danny. You predicted unemployment would rise; it hasn't. You were wrong, not for the first time.
@andy_s_64 11 of many who were out - the rest were knocking on doors. And FYI, I am a Tory MP.
@alexwilden not so fast... my road constantly has rubbish strewn about and weeds everywhere...!

@hawkins_carole so not the greatest # of people in work ever, or unemployment coming down, or the narrowing of gap between rich and poor?
@Feline_Gardener to be fair, Network Rail's fault - but appalling service nonetheless. Why we need billions invested in our line.
@Sederrick @ameliareynolds0 @BBCLookEast not my choice - the question that was put to me!
@Porritt thanks Richard.
@Porritt @greateranglia @networkrail agreed.
@TimHolder11 thank you Tim!
@kingeric1969 @greateranglia @theresecoffey We're working so hard on this but it is going to take time. Billions of investment being spent.
@playpictorial dunno - pls email me and I will find out. ben@bengummer.com
@hawkins_carole you really are partisan. What will it take for you to believe that things are getting better?
@huwtaylor theatres in Ipswich are delighted
@gMAKinteriors @wilcock_kelly quite right... opted in at last moment and had no helmet on me. Happily roads closed so was safer than usual.
@stonojnr @greateranglia not a pipe dream: the investment we need to run a decent railway will also deliver a quicker one.
@stonojnr @greateranglia nope - which is why we need the investment

@D_Blanchflower always the same with you Danny - when you're trapped you resort to insults. I feel sorry for you.
@D_Blanchflower no, the one where you over-estimated unemployment peak by - er - a few million.
@rsaeed @maxjfreeman @rcp123456 @DrBasselAbuward I've made my view very plain to ministers and to constituents.
@rsaeed what an extraordinary thing to say.

@SteveAllman well, on libraries it didn't - but let's leave that. Frank's involvement here should reassure you I hope.
@SooThomas it's an open consultation! Get involved. I know Frank will want as broad a range of opinion as possible.
@SooThomas nope - where there are expensive leases they will look for other less expensive locations nearby.
@SooThomas actually not Sue: a consultation led by Frank Field to improve services. Hope you get involved.
@SteveAllman actually Steve - Tories vote for consultation to improve services led by Labour's Frank Field.
Delighted that Frank Field to help lead consultation on future of Suffolk's Children's Centres. Few know more about early intervention.

Stunning unemployment figs for Ips: now down 31.1% since May 2010. Youth down 45.5% and the biggest fall yet in long term 7.4% in one month.
Great promotions yesterday but the best local news was the recognition of @theresecoffey - she'll be an exceptional whip and a minister too.
We are making the hard road to full employment. We can get there - if we stick to the long term economic plan.

Long-term unemployment still too high but coming down at a pace: 25 fewer people last month signing on for more than 12 months. Progress.
Youth unemployment in Ipswich now 40% lower than in May 2010 - giving hope of a job and a career to young people.
In Ipswich, joblessness now a full 26% lower than in May 2010 - and fell by 5.3% last month alone.

@eddieduggan @Marky_Simmo @Delayed_Again @donnaptc @greateranglia They did. Why we need improvements.
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @gorstewart @jameselmer73trn @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss I'm helping to write the franchise with Taskforce.
@eddieduggan @greater_anglia yes
@donnaptc @eddieduggan @Delayed_Again @greateranglia frequency depends on new infrastructure and new rolling stock. We need whole package.
@ImogenDempsey39 @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @jameselmer73trn @Delayed_Again er - no refurbed till later this year - so no pics
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @jameselmer73trn the leaflet is accurate - refurb (with more seats) then new
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @jameselmer73trn ... Hence why we've secured refurb to bridge gap.
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @jameselmer73trn no. Not possible to have new immediately: lead times etc...
@jameselmer73trn @ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss yep. Half money needed is for infrastructure, half trains.
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @jameselmer73trn 2016 franchise will decide funding route
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss commitment to deliver Norwich in 90, which will require new trains.
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss correct - there aren't any - because we only secured the funding in Nov.
@ImogenDempsey39 @Delayed_Again @mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss I do wish people would establish the facts before flinging insults around...
@mproberts1977 @AlasdairRoss @Delayed_Again refurbished this year, then new by 2020: earliest there is free space in manufacturing queue

@StokeParkCllr @Delayed_Again trains will start being refurbished in next few months; new trains will follow in new franchise.
@PaulChip436 why's that?
@LaLegatron @greateranglia ok. All of these will be refurbished over next few months and then replaced with new in next franchise. Disgrace.
@StokeParkCllr ... @ChloeSmithMP has invited @Delayed_Again and all other users on Twitter to a meeting in HoC, which I shall go to.
@StokeParkCllr Nadia - @Delayed_Again is not a constituent and I've stopped replying to them as they are only interested in insults. Chloe..
@PaulHar14587086 @Delayed_Again @LaLegatron it's why we're getting new rolling stock and in meantime current stuff will be refurbed.
@LaLegatron @greateranglia ridiculous. What rolling stock was it?
@someotherboy given that she is six years younger than me, Naomi - and her mother - would be very surprised to hear that claim.

@RiannaT37 DfE does not prescribe or proscribe texts - merely sets broad outline. OCR has made decision.
@KaiserMeeky2nd you should be ashamed of using that picture.
@RiannaT37 he isn't.
@DerekAir1 really...
@joseph_flanagan they aren't
@niblomusic @Lipsytweet yep - that's right - including the 250,000 fewer kids in failing secondary schools than in 2010.
@DerekAir1 you can do both. And DfE does neither.
@Lipsytweet DfE does not prescribe texts
@joseph_flanagan we're not.
@jemima_daisy DfE does not prescribe texts
@veetee39 DfE does not prescribe texts
@HaplessDad not a DfE decision - does not prescribe texts.
@glenchisholm not DfE decision - exam boards.
@DerekAir1 that's nice. Perhaps you'd like to retract now I've told you that the DfE does not prescribe texts.
@666molly he's done nothing of the sort - DfE does not prescribe texts.
@WhaleyDaly check the facts - the DfE does not prescribe texts. One board has dropped them, which is different.
@joseph_flanagan they aren't - DfE does not prescribe texts.
The wonderful Nadia Cenci @StokeParkCllr holds Stoke Park: a great councillor justly rewarded by her electorate for all her hard work.

@Naishy @Home4Gd I have! It's a good thing...
@GrumpyHarri ... that will bring new rolling stock, better reliability, faster journey times - but this is going to take 6-7 years to finish
@GrumpyHarri trains are starting to be refurbished - will look better from end of year onwards. Now we're working on big investment.,.
@Camdaman let me see what's happening...
65 fewer long-term unemployed in our town in the course of just 30 days - a sign of how our welfare reforms are giving people new hope.
Long-term unemployment still far too high but the fall this month the largest for years - 6.7% in just four and a half weeks.
Youth unemployment a full third lower than at the the time of the General Election: we are reversing the tragic legacy of wasted young lives
195 fewer people on JSA in just one month in Ipswich - a fall of 6.4%. Unemployment in the town now lower than at any time since Nov 2008.
Really strong job figures from Ipswich today. More to do but the long term economic plan is working for our town.

Reduction in long-term unemployment shows our welfare reforms are working - giving people chance of dignity in work.
Excellent unemployment figures for Ipswich today: unemployment lowest since Dec. 2008; youth down and big long-term drop to below 1,000.
@nikkiadele do both. Talking to people on low incomes you'll find that only relief they've had in last few years is tax cuts aimed at them.
@nikkiadele look at the stats - Gainsborough failed by Labour
@nikkiadele last week.
@nikkiadele that's why it's good to see the gap between rich and poor narrowing - first time in decades
Not since records began in 1997 has CPI fallen for 6 months in a row. Much more to do but our long term economic plan is working.

@bodsonmate and?
@SimonGosden er - it's why we're getting more first timers back into housing than for several years.
@bodsonmate yes - because grade inflation has stopped, which means trust coming back to exams.
@SimonGosden except for all those families that now have a house because of our reforms.
@hawkins_carole the gap between rich and poor has narrowed under this government. I am very proud of that.
@bodsonmate Mmmm... That's why 250k fewer secondary school kids now in failing schools than in 2010.
@bodsonmate non-QTS teachers lower than when MG became SoS. Sixth-form funding at 2012 levels.
@bodsonmate swearing one thing - being loose with genocidal language another.
@hawkins_carole perhaps you'd like to read his bio before you Tweet such silly things.
@jwchenery yes - and we have a long way to go but an important moment nonetheless.
@andrewpolitics and what progress have other parties made to matching that record?
@RichardPalmer58 it's a "she" Richard - I know UKIP have some odd views on women in the professions but the clue's in the name.

@Delayed_Again I've got my own private carriage.
@RickyAndrews83 @TwinsplusTwo of course I do - I travel on it normally four - six times a week. We've promised new trains and N in 90.
@TwinsplusTwo yep - which is why we've capped price rises and extended tax free travel loans. You will see service improvements soon too.
@Delayed_Again @TwinsplusTwo @RickyAndrews83 you have no idea whether it is zero investment - it has not been let.
@TwinsplusTwo which goes to show with focus - it is now much better...
@Delayed_Again @TwinsplusTwo @RickyAndrews83 because no one's spent any money on it for years - something we're putting right.
@TwinsplusTwo I know - I have said many times that it is affecting lives. But I'm not going to lie and say it is easily I fixed.

@Delayed_Again @TwinsplusTwo @RickyAndrews83 I know you are - but rather than hurling insults at everyone recognize that we are working
@TwinsplusTwo @RickyAndrews83 @greateranglia sorry - meant I had given up being insulted by @Delayed_Again.

@BernardMcEldown it's a fact that Labour always leave office with unemployment higher than when they come in. Go figure.
The FCA starts a new era of regulation of payday lenders today: good news in the battle against extortionate lending.
@BernardMcEldown you are correct in part - private sector jobs created not by gov but by business: that is a very Tory thing to understand!
@BernardMcEldown er - just work out the logic of that statement...
@BernardMcEldown unemployment now much lower than in 2010. That is the truth.
Farage's approval of Putin in the long and sordid tradition of extremist apologists. Disgusting.

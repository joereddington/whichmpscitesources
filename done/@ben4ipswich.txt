Matt Hancock: With #LongTermPlan to secure clean, reliable energy in a way that doesn't cost the earth, we can rise to this challenge #bbcdp Mon Apr 20 14:55:57 BST 2015
@katiewardwriter in that case yes! Mon Apr 20 11:49:19 BST 2015

My favourite canvassing moment of last week - with Mr Biondi in his beautiful garden - peas, pears and Padre Pio. http://t.co/rnM7sAJVkQ Sun Apr 19 21:48:16 BST 2015
@MattyBrucey I can help win investment but what I can't do is plan town centre - that is Borough Council's job. Sun Apr 19 20:13:26 BST 2015
@Ebenopsis I prefer screens to empty shops, given the choice. Best not make the perfect the enemy of the good. Sun Apr 19 18:58:37 BST 2015
You should see what the other guy looked like @glenchisholm #Holi #HolywellsPark http://t.co/n0l4Ba4YkM Sun Apr 19 18:43:39 BST 2015
@Kitty_Spolitti I just wonder if it had not been me with a group of friends who had sat down and got a coffee whether you'd mind #partial Sun Apr 19 18:24:15 BST 2015
@Kitty_Spolitti so you were not in front of me in a cafe queue. Just for the record. Sun Apr 19 18:13:46 BST 2015
@Kitty_Spolitti well I'm confused as I was not in the queue and did not buy anything. Sun Apr 19 17:25:17 BST 2015
@JadeObama Jade - it's not your money or mine - it's the owner's and they can do what they like with it. Wld prefer screens than empty shops Sun Apr 19 17:23:47 BST 2015
@JoWyard ben@bengummer.com Sun Apr 19 17:21:27 BST 2015
@JoWyard Jo - can you email me so I can respond to your petitioners? Sun Apr 19 17:21:19 BST 2015
@Kitty_Spolitti oh please - my friends, not an entourage, and we were out for the day. They took a table, which is normal I believe... Sun Apr 19 17:15:12 BST 2015
@Kitty_Spolitti nothing wrong with that. Glad they are involved in policy issues - I was at DfE so makes sense... Sun Apr 19 17:13:28 BST 2015
@JadeObama it's private money - their decision. Sun Apr 19 17:11:57 BST 2015
@66ALW99 we've got to do both at same time. Sun Apr 19 17:11:15 BST 2015
@Ebenopsis it's a private investment. We need both new entertainment, shops and businesses. This is one piece of a whole. Sun Apr 19 17:10:48 BST 2015
@JadeObama we should do both. Business rates should be cut by IBC for some retailers. Sun Apr 19 17:10:04 BST 2015
@Sstampcomms thanks Sarah! Sun Apr 19 17:09:29 BST 2015
@elundy1 thank you Eddie. Sun Apr 19 17:09:22 BST 2015
@Wood9SQN I support freedom of people to go shooting. Sun Apr 19 17:09:08 BST 2015
@JadeObama that's up to the private investor, but this will be much better offer than Odeon - restaurants and a gym. Sun Apr 19 17:04:24 BST 2015
@Suffolk1953 I hope to ensure you stay in Ipswich! Sun Apr 19 17:03:32 BST 2015
@kwnave Winerack going to be finished soon - work starting in October - contracts being let at the moment. I am sure that cinema will happen Sun Apr 19 17:02:10 BST 2015

@MattyBrucey my powers very limited - I'm not council. Money for new bus stations and new paving to come in Queen's Street for e.g. Sun Apr 19 16:59:58 BST 2015
@lilylollylala2 @worldofpr sadly for my pocket I am not a property developer. Private investor doing it and I prefer screens to empty shops. Sun Apr 19 09:50:41 BST 2015

@woollyvix apologies - was rapidly responding to many Tweet. Policy will create social housing and give people a chance of owning own home. Sat Apr 18 11:10:25 BST 2015
@johnRNorth55 we'll have to differ on that - I want to give people a chance of owning their own home even if they do not have bank of M&D. Sat Apr 18 11:09:33 BST 2015
@woollyvix you asked a question - and the answer to it is no. The policy we are proposing now is one for one, so no effect on stock. Sat Apr 18 09:57:14 BST 2015
@OrigRumpShaka that is not good - I apologise. I wanted you to intern - wondered what had happened. Sat Apr 18 09:52:53 BST 2015

@johnRNorth55 so more than the one then! Fri Apr 17 19:06:48 BST 2015
@CRA1G_EVANS new trains written into new franchise - we won that too. Fri Apr 17 19:05:53 BST 2015
@CRA1G_EVANS That's not correct, FYI: new track (Ipswich Curve) approx. £59m was new money for new track. Fri Apr 17 19:05:37 BST 2015
@alastairharding more than in 2010 - not that that fact worries opponents. Fri Apr 17 19:03:53 BST 2015
@newlesa50 it is. Fri Apr 17 19:03:24 BST 2015
@katiewardwriter I'd like to think so - depends by what definition I suppose... Fri Apr 17 19:02:56 BST 2015

@mickwatson65 first new council housing in several generations being built by this government. Fri Apr 17 18:59:17 BST 2015
@PaulMacca precisely why we have to sort it out. With one more term I can finish the job - 000s millions £s coming down the line. Fri Apr 17 18:58:47 BST 2015

Labour's fiscal plans are the same as '02-'08, when they borrowed during a boom. That is why they crashed the car. http://t.co/PlvwTfD9P5 Mon Apr 13 22:46:25 BST 2015

@maxjfreeman it's not unforgivable, not a sin and not something you need apologise for. It's democracy. Mon Apr 13 08:14:21 BST 2015
@ImogenDempsey39 I take exception to that. We're getting new trains by 2020. Not in the habit of lying. Mon Apr 13 08:10:33 BST 2015

@BMETBC an appropriate lighting glow for the saintly @margotjames2015 Fri Mar 27 21:43:27 GMT 2015
@dejavousagain @ostercywriter @DPJHodges wow - incisive argument there. Well done. Fri Mar 27 21:40:30 GMT 2015
This is very important by @DPJHodges - explains precisely why @Ed_Miliband should never be allowed near No 10. http://t.co/GqPNmlPuVQ Fri Mar 27 18:53:39 GMT 2015
@LALALAWRIGHT sorry but you misunderstand - I was voting to have a secret ballot, like when you vote. Most are agreed good thing. Fri Mar 27 18:42:46 GMT 2015
@Tommywolsey you against secret ballots? Fri Mar 27 16:01:39 GMT 2015
Ben in the Pub in the Dove tonight - 1930-2100. Hope to see as many as can make it - one of my favourites. Fri Mar 27 16:00:53 GMT 2015
@LALALAWRIGHT it was actually on a secret ballot, which is a good thing - unless you are the Labour chief whip. Fri Mar 27 15:59:42 GMT 2015
@MyNameIsJonnyD actually they were split. Fri Mar 27 15:59:01 GMT 2015
@JohnWilliamslab @MiyahCurtis Yep - in the voting lobby. Fri Mar 27 00:35:56 GMT 2015
@MiyahCurtis parliament dissolved on Sunday Fri Mar 27 00:34:24 GMT 2015
@simonsays__ yes Fri Mar 27 00:34:03 GMT 2015
@MyNameIsJonnyD in favour of secret ballot Fri Mar 27 00:33:50 GMT 2015
Alex Salmond: ready to "call the tune” http://t.co/v0ehPNjUMy Thu Mar 26 22:41:30 GMT 2015
@MiyahCurtis I hope so too. I'm an ex-MP on Sunday so have more time for a few weeks... Thu Mar 26 22:24:18 GMT 2015
@marthapiper_ thanks - but just wanted to express my irritation... Thu Mar 26 22:22:11 GMT 2015
@imnotbean thank you. I am passionate about it. Thu Mar 26 22:18:57 GMT 2015
@jamestarbit my primary duty as an MP is to vote. That is what I was elected to do. Thu Mar 26 22:18:27 GMT 2015
@marthapiper_ was unbelievably old frustrating - very keen to do hustings. Thu Mar 26 22:17:27 GMT 2015
@bryony1963 and the election campaign is 6 weeks. Thu Mar 26 22:16:42 GMT 2015
@bryony1963 and I shall be. I've spent more time in schools than any previous MP for Ipswich. Thu Mar 26 21:58:50 GMT 2015
@JamesWallace30 thank you for seeing that. Thu Mar 26 21:58:05 GMT 2015
@LALALAWRIGHT parliament still sitting. That is my first duty. It is why we were elected. Thu Mar 26 21:57:48 GMT 2015
@marthapiper_ was held in parliament. Thu Mar 26 21:57:03 GMT 2015
@JohnWilliamslab @MiyahCurtis vote was on secret ballot, not the speaker. The most important thing we do is vote. It's why we're elected. Thu Mar 26 21:56:40 GMT 2015
@MiyahCurtis because I was told at 5 in morning. Thu Mar 26 21:52:32 GMT 2015
@MrJordanHolder I think so yes. Thu Mar 26 21:52:10 GMT 2015
@LALALAWRIGHT no - voting as MPs are supposed to do always comes first. That is what I was elected to do. Thu Mar 26 21:51:54 GMT 2015
@IpswichGreens for secret ballot. Thu Mar 26 21:51:15 GMT 2015
@elenahandy voting is the key requirement of an MP - that is what we are elected to do. I was as frustrated as you, I can assure you. Thu Mar 26 21:51:03 GMT 2015
@bryony1963 @MiyahCurtis sorry but couldn't have done - vote was going to be at 1130 but speaker moved it. Thu Mar 26 21:49:53 GMT 2015
@bryony1963 funnily enough, voting is the key requirement of being an MP. Thu Mar 26 21:48:46 GMT 2015
@ChloeApples so am I - very. Thu Mar 26 09:23:51 GMT 2015
@MiyahCurtis called back to London late last night - so sorry but risk of job - explained to Mrs H. Thu Mar 26 09:23:38 GMT 2015

@olliewarren we've already closed it - sorry, but it's a scare story. Wed Mar 25 12:43:20 GMT 2015
@robaldous13 well, they're being rather quiet about this policy now that it is clear that they wanted to freeze prices at historic high... Wed Mar 25 10:19:03 GMT 2015
@geraldwiley8 @4_yp went some time ago - will go again soon. Thanks for prod! Wed Mar 25 10:08:55 GMT 2015
@robaldous13 independent consumer groups think so. Price cuts wld have been bigger if threat of freeze not there. Wed Mar 25 10:08:19 GMT 2015
@mmmjaycee dunno. Do you want me to investigate? Wed Mar 25 10:06:17 GMT 2015
@imnotbean thanks! We do for a lot of our stuff (Tuddenham Press) but we get bull rates at St Ives cos combined with other candidates. Wed Mar 25 10:05:36 GMT 2015
Labour's "price freeze" has cost families even if as a threat - imagine what it would have done in actuality. Tue Mar 24 10:42:53 GMT 2015
Worth remembering, again, that inflation would be higher if Miliband's energy price freeze had been in place. Tue Mar 24 10:41:43 GMT 2015
"Good" zero inflation supply-side driven; demand still strong - further tribute to robust long term economic plan. Tue Mar 24 10:40:51 GMT 2015
@supergoodlife agreed. Seeing SoS on Thursday - will mention. Mon Mar 23 17:40:52 GMT 2015

@PeterThurlow charming! Thu Mar 19 08:51:32 GMT 2015
@nic_r24 so email me - ben@bengummer.com Thu Mar 19 08:50:28 GMT 2015
@nic_r24 I'm sorry you feel that as from my experience that is not the case - email me to tell your experiences. Thu Mar 19 08:20:26 GMT 2015
@GavinBarwellMP like Liverpool Street station lol! Thu Mar 19 05:28:42 GMT 2015
@nic_r24 thank you Nic. We were told that 5 years ago but have turned things round. It is a bold plan for the future - without debt. Thu Mar 19 05:27:00 GMT 2015
@i_am_27omen nothing to do with Budget - @SuffolkOne funded like all other schools. Special circs need sorting out, which I am doing. Thu Mar 19 05:25:36 GMT 2015
@anniefoss thanks got it and on it. Wed Mar 18 11:16:52 GMT 2015
@D_Blanchflower - how about that rise in jobs to record levels, coupled with more wage growth? Wed Mar 18 11:14:38 GMT 2015
@LaLegatron will get latest Wed Mar 18 10:43:19 GMT 2015
This is a sustainable recovery built on jobs. I am proud to have shown again that we are the true party of labour. Wed Mar 18 10:22:02 GMT 2015
Youth unemp. now 53% lower than in May 2010 - and at record low rate. Fewer young people without a job in our town than at height of boom. Wed Mar 18 10:21:34 GMT 2015
There are now 1,530 fewer Jobseekers in Ipswich than in May 2010 - that's 1,530 more people with the security of a sustainable job. Wed Mar 18 10:19:35 GMT 2015
Particularly pleased to see number of people unemployed for over 12 months fall again in Ipswich, by 3% in one month alone. Wed Mar 18 10:18:03 GMT 2015
Record employment in UK, record lows in unemployment in our town, wages rising faster than inflation. We can't afford to ditch the plan. Wed Mar 18 10:15:53 GMT 2015
Profoundly depressing http://t.co/HcRwHTlW1c Wed Mar 18 07:06:31 GMT 2015
@hairyconflake and on this I will - please email me so I can reply. Tue Mar 17 19:29:05 GMT 2015
@deanofsurrey @LogicalLorena @TheRedRag @StokeParkCllr so they get a Labour MP who opposes a referendum - go figure Tue Mar 17 19:28:28 GMT 2015
@hairyconflake we should all celebrate the success we've had in getting people back into work with wages rising - not talking economy down. Tue Mar 17 19:25:45 GMT 2015
@hairyconflake hurts you to admit it, that is. Tue Mar 17 19:11:45 GMT 2015
@hairyconflake no - different order of magnitude. Our plan is working - I know it hurts but you'll have to get over it. Tue Mar 17 19:10:00 GMT 2015

@i_am_27omen precisely what I am doing. Tue Mar 17 12:42:59 GMT 2015
@hairyconflake as I said, underlying trade deficit (stripping out effect of price movements) has narrowed. Tue Mar 17 10:08:56 GMT 2015
@i_am_27omen agreed - but this is a complicated issue that is taking time to resolve. Tue Mar 17 10:03:37 GMT 2015
@Sstampcomms @vickyford @JackieDP hear hear Tue Mar 17 10:02:53 GMT 2015
@LALALAWRIGHT good to talk. Tue Mar 17 07:59:37 GMT 2015

@martinbeard01 sadly not. Thu Mar 12 20:19:46 GMT 2015
Where do you start with Farage on race... if discrimination laws no longer necessary, then why scrap them? Thu Mar 12 20:04:42 GMT 2015

@SteveMorphew @ChloeSmithMP its part of £100m plus we've secured in this CP for track improvements. Rest to come in CP6. Tue Mar 03 18:46:24 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew @ChloeSmithMP actually you're wrong. But as I say, do your reading and then we can debate. Tue Mar 03 16:49:48 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew @ChloeSmithMP finally - be honest about the fact that you want to delay new franchise and therefore new trains and track. Ciao Tue Mar 03 16:48:14 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew and the work's already begun. Which is why track closed at weekends. So you'll see @ChloeSmithMP delivers. Tue Mar 03 16:47:07 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew @ChloeSmithMP not rude, just pointing out that had you read our report, you would have seen call for infrastructure. Tue Mar 03 16:46:12 GMT 2015

@jamesoflynn @karlmccartney @Ed_Miliband what, you mean someone taking a word by its meaning! Scandalous! Goodbye. Tue Feb 17 11:07:06 GMT 2015
@RepStones @LouiseMensch unless @Ed_Miliband has picked a fight with the English language I am not aware of the meaning of 'freeze' changing Tue Feb 17 11:06:29 GMT 2015
@johnRNorth55 it's not everything but it is important, which is why pols need to use moderate and accurate language. Tue Feb 17 11:04:55 GMT 2015
@tubbyteacher yes and it was also designed so that it could easily be altered. Tue Feb 17 11:03:55 GMT 2015
@RepStones @LouiseMensch @Ed_Miliband not a claim, a quote: a freeze.  Which means, presumably, a freeze. Tue Feb 17 10:35:05 GMT 2015
@ifanmj @Ed_Miliband he said a freeze.  Which means a freeze.  Not a ceiling but a freeze. Tue Feb 17 10:34:18 GMT 2015
@jamesoflynn @karlmccartney @Ed_Miliband freeze means a freeze means a freeze. Tue Feb 17 10:33:55 GMT 2015
@johnRNorth55 nope: has narrowed since 2010. Tue Feb 17 10:33:30 GMT 2015

@tubbyteacher I am not a champion for any sponsor - I did champion the new building, as I won the money for it. My priority is what works. Mon Feb 16 08:59:57 GMT 2015

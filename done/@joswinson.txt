@Xen0m0rp4 you have to deal with the deficit before you can start paying down the debt - basic economics Tue Apr 28 01:10:03 BST 2015
@Xen0m0rp4 @natalie_coupar are you doubting my Scottishness just because I don't support independence? Scottish does not equal SNP Tue Apr 28 01:08:40 BST 2015
@johnco Twitter following? I don't follow your point (excuse the pun) Tue Apr 28 01:05:54 BST 2015

@davitmcgirr actually, we do know it would have meant higher debt given opposition to tackling the deficit Sat Apr 25 00:06:18 BST 2015
@MFCRicky @UKIP or maybe not... Fri Apr 24 23:54:21 BST 2015

@Rachel__McL @BelindaBG can't fault your cheery courtesy Rachel :-) enjoy the weekend too! Fri Apr 24 23:44:55 BST 2015
@PoliticsScot we have done some of this e.g. crackdown on tax avoid: but your recipe doesn't sound like it would actually tackle the deficit Fri Apr 24 13:31:25 BST 2015
@PoliticsScot @LibDems actually it's exactly the point if you're worried about debt increase - how would you have tackled deficit? Fri Apr 24 13:16:20 BST 2015
@blueskysinking @IsabelHardman Thanks John! Fri Apr 24 13:14:45 BST 2015
@ArmandDAngour @TeleWonderWomen I feel the same - though hadn't considered the double standard with "basically" Fri Apr 24 13:08:36 BST 2015

@curious_laddie @Roy1Batty @MankoBranko @LibDems that could perhaps explain the spelling but probably not the random abuse Thu Apr 16 11:03:41 BST 2015
@elaurence agree that a serious issue, though no excuse for gratuitous rudeness on Twitter - better to engage in debate than just post abuse Thu Apr 16 10:48:33 BST 2015
@CJR0bertson did you not cover the difference between your and you're until university? primary school surely? Thu Apr 16 10:44:26 BST 2015
@Mae_Carson1 @iainmacwhirter no,  it's spelling - "you're" has been spelled wrongly as "your" Thu Apr 16 10:42:55 BST 2015
@ColSMal @AlanRoden shows truly independent - even including Tory activists in the poll! Thu Apr 16 10:39:58 BST 2015
@35mphab I don't think the difference between your and you're is really university level English is it? Thu Apr 16 10:35:32 BST 2015
Yes the poll says it is so close between me & SNP it is within the margin of error - http://t.co/7z1A7Yih5M https://t.co/uYnPq5Hwal Thu Apr 16 09:14:15 BST 2015

@_DaisyBenson @laylamoran Thank you indeed!  :-) Wed Apr 15 22:50:01 BST 2015
@_davidam19 read my leaflets - loads of our positive policies in them from tax cut to pensions triple lock to NHS funding Tue Apr 14 22:40:34 BST 2015
@_davidam19 so Scottish equivalent of 2m would be 200,000 - even if it were 25,000/yr (& that's not what Swinney said btw) still much less Tue Apr 14 15:57:19 BST 2015
Very proud of introducing shared parental leave - if you agree, pls donate to my campaign http://t.co/7z1A7Y0Gee https://t.co/fbRfdMHV45 Tue Apr 14 11:53:49 BST 2015
@this_karen @nickclegg Cheers Karen - good policy and I'm glad it's being well used Tue Apr 14 00:38:15 BST 2015
@jrbrown86 @BBCScot2015 my point was coalition govt has delivered 2 million apprenticeships in Eng, unambitious SNP govt only 25,000 in Scot Tue Apr 14 00:37:14 BST 2015
@Kirsteenjones that's just not true - it was 5% and is now 6% of NHS in England Tue Apr 14 00:34:35 BST 2015
@Kirsteenjones we increased NHS funding by 4.4% real terms 2009-2014 (IFS figures) - in Scotland it fell 1.2% in same period Mon Apr 13 23:33:27 BST 2015
@IndigoFast you obviously weren't watching when I outlined LibDem plans to give Scottish NHS £800m more & challenged SNP on NHS funding fall Mon Apr 13 23:31:40 BST 2015

@tony_vose @cpmcgonagle how is it any more unreal than maternity leave? Sun Apr 12 22:56:55 BST 2015
@scottydog354 though as early yrs educ it's devolved, SNPGovt less keen: @scotlibdems got them to extend to some 2yo but still less generous Sun Apr 12 22:55:41 BST 2015
@scottydog354 Yes, Lib Dem policy is to extend the free 15hrs/wk to all 2 y.o and to all younger children whose parents both work Sun Apr 12 22:53:33 BST 2015
@tony_vose @cpmcgonagle how is it any more "impractical" for dads to take parental leave than for mums? Sun Apr 12 20:37:03 BST 2015
@tony_vose well parents don't *have* to use it, it's an option for them - the feedback I've had is pretty positive Sun Apr 12 20:35:47 BST 2015
@cpmcgonagle and congratulations Sun Apr 12 20:33:50 BST 2015
@cpmcgonagle absolutely! Sun Apr 12 20:33:38 BST 2015
@Andy_Harding @LibDems Yes we've been saying quite a lot about how we'd actually give the NHS the £8bn it needs: https://t.co/HFcWFXiJxP Sun Apr 12 20:25:01 BST 2015
@djm4 @Independent I noticed that too! Sun Apr 12 20:22:54 BST 2015

@Wonkypolicywonk @DebraClaridge I don't think that's the case! Tue Apr 07 09:26:43 BST 2015
@benpmoody @fatherhoodinst shared parental pay same whether man or woman & we encourage firms to enhance SPP if they also enhance maternity Tue Apr 07 09:24:05 BST 2015
@peacockfeather we're certainly encouraging it - Civil Service is, plus companies like Shell,  PWC, Deloitte have already committed to Tue Apr 07 09:22:08 BST 2015

@shaunieholmes @LibDems next time maybe :-) ? Mon Apr 06 16:35:53 BST 2015
@shaunieholmes @LibDems Sadly not - policy came in for babies due on or after 5 April so don't qualify unless your little one was premature Mon Apr 06 16:35:14 BST 2015

@dwichmann1981 @caronmlindsay @LibDems we're encouraging companies to enhance shared parental pay like many do for maternity pay Sat Mar 14 16:24:36 GMT 2015
@euandavidson Thanks Euan - and again for your help last weekend Sat Mar 14 16:18:04 GMT 2015
@insideMANmag @BelindaBG examples I gave today were about women, though my last conf speech criticised media portrayal of 'hapless dads' Sat Mar 14 16:15:46 GMT 2015

@KatMiddleton Thanks Kat Sat Mar 14 16:03:11 GMT 2015
@No_Supermarket @OllyGrender not like you characterise it at all, journalist-led for a start - full speech makes that clear Sat Mar 14 16:02:46 GMT 2015
@CommonSenseNo1 @caronmlindsay @LibDems actual research shows early involvement from dads as well as mums improves child development Sat Mar 14 16:01:48 GMT 2015
@DavidMGreen92 Thank you David! Sat Mar 14 15:59:26 GMT 2015

@esbagshaw Thank you Elaine - enjoyed taking part in @LibDemsTeam2015 Sat Mar 14 00:11:01 GMT 2015
@carlamccormack agree burden should not be on women but also want to encourage women to get ahead even when we haven't fixed the system yet Sat Mar 14 00:06:13 GMT 2015
@carlamccormack absolutely - that's why pay transparency so vital, makes companies ask themselves what they're doing wrong Fri Mar 13 13:27:16 GMT 2015
@ruthiecoops @gabrielladriver Thanks Ruth! Fri Mar 13 07:41:19 GMT 2015

@Girlguiding @PoliticalYeti love the *rolls up sleeves* attitude! Thu Mar 12 22:22:40 GMT 2015
@VivienMartin4 @MiriamBrett I campaign for change but in my view govt regulating press on what they can / can't print is dangerous #China Thu Mar 12 22:22:08 GMT 2015
@PoliticalYeti @Girlguiding true! Thu Mar 12 22:13:20 GMT 2015
@BryonyMerritt @BirkbeckNews was delighted to be able to pop in! Thu Mar 12 22:12:25 GMT 2015

@civic_voice @LibDemConf fairly chocca diary but we may bump into each other Thu Mar 12 22:04:06 GMT 2015
#SharedParentalLeave gives dads the chance to be there for key firsts in their child's life http://t.co/RzTFs2ifKb Thu Mar 12 19:01:05 GMT 2015
@VivienMartin4 @MiriamBrett agree shocking &unacceptable (though Scot press not immune to media sexism, too much of it both sides of border) Thu Mar 12 15:17:28 GMT 2015
@Science_Grrl hadn't seen it but fantastic campaign! Thu Mar 12 15:07:57 GMT 2015

@BrusselsLout @Fascinatingpics not a fact. What source do you rely on for your "fact"? Thu Mar 12 13:40:34 GMT 2015
@Casumptious @HumzaYousaf @Margaret_Curran @DavidCoburnUKip I didn't - was never scheduled to be doing it as had debates in Parliament Thu Mar 12 13:36:12 GMT 2015
@JohannaLloyd @MorrisseyHelena great buzz at the event I thought! Thu Mar 12 13:31:49 GMT 2015

@StromNatasha @nick_clegg Cheers Natasha Mon Mar 09 08:02:05 GMT 2015
@SEMcQ @nick_clegg information can be very powerful - employers will analyse why they have a gap and stakeholders will also hold to account Mon Mar 09 08:01:50 GMT 2015
@HRBullets Emily made interesting speech on this in HoC on Thurs - certainly merits further debate, but one for next parliament given timing Mon Mar 09 08:00:34 GMT 2015

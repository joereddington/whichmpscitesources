@joswinson
@alexriley1995 @LibDemDiversity @LibDems if it persists once we eliminate the overall pay gap, then absolutely
@ariadneassoc @Wonkypolicywonk an imaginative analogy for sure :-)
@Austinwrk @LibDemPress encouraging sexual abuse is not the same as free speech
@ArwenSWebb Thanks Arwen - just wish it didn't need saying!
@missgeog @TheresaMay_MP yes I've already had the 'it's free speech' tweets - as if encouraging abuse is free speech
@jmp223420 encouraging sexual abuse isn't free speech
@scottmmmm my mum was a teacher so I appreciate some of the challenges, feel free to email me more details and I'll take up the issues
@PoliticalYeti brilliant - especially like the last line!
@WildHens @bttowerlondon great to meet you too!
@rdbrewer4 what? Rather confused what word you think I want to ban?
@Wendy_Hallett lovely to see you again Wendy - keep up the fab work!
@PatricksPeople I had prior diary commitments so couldn't attend - if there's a particular aspect you are concerned about pls do email me
@PatricksPeople no, as a Minister I can only speak in HoC on my policy areas
@bululimited Thanks - it was a lively debate!
@mactab52 delighted to hear that she is! Is she on Twitter?
@HulbertMathew Thanks Mathew
@gogza I couldn't attend the debate but happy to take up any issues you're concerned about if you drop me an email
@mrwilsunshine @nick_clegg good if they do so of course but not clear if there's evidence of need to regulate this?
@GirlTalkHQ Thanks for the blog!
@charliejournal1 not easy to solve in 140 characters - but one key thing is to ask more women to stand for parliament - get encouraging!
@caronmlindsay  sorry rather missed the boat as haven't been on Twitter much this week!
@delpaterson @ShonaRobison to be fair,  it isn't very long to wait - they're reporting at the end of the month!
@norfolksteeler obviously I don't know the specifics but feel free to write to me / email me at BIS
@Wonkypolicywonk @ariadneassoc lol! I much prefer tea anyway...
@gtlscot I will double check - if you send me an email I can let you know (assuming you're a constituent)
Excellent points from @willie_rennie at #sldconf re need for parity of esteem for mental & physical health issues http://t.co/e4v3nK9rx5
Delighted tonight at #Mentorsme Awards @bttowerlondon to announce funding for mentoring for female entrepreneurs: http://t.co/cVI801uwfZ
@gtlscot what vote when?
@niallcampbell10 clashes with Parliamentary business so I can't be there,  happy to make representations to EDC if people want me to
@_oatc_ @MartinRobbOU @Govt_Women @Govt_Equality @fernee2 will double check and rectify for future events
@MartinRobbOU :-)
@SianSteans @drlangtry_girl @nick_clegg @timfarron certainly - I think Jessica Ennis-Hill made an excellent point earlier hence my retweet
@citydaduk @itv_thismorning Thanks!
@BloggingBeth @Govt_Women no I mean half! If we only use half the talent it will take twice as long, or half as quickly
@EllulCoolJ @itv_thismorning brilliant!
@MartinRobbOU @Govt_Women @Govt_Equality @fernee2 great to meet you
@ladylaxton @Govt_Women absolutely!
@frannie_annie88 @NickyMorgan01 @HMRCpressoffice @Govt_Women glad you enjoyed it!
@EdwardAdoo think it has now made it to my Ministerial office and they are in touch?
@CoachingDB @ChrisHall5 well I was talking about our ideas for further income tax cuts for low paid and govt help with childcare costs
@jacksduncan @LibDemPress @LibDems Thanks Jack!
@citydaduk @itv_thismorning people knowing about it is essential to increase uptake,  so I'm determined to publicise SPL!
Delighted to see further crackdown on payday lenders - interest & fees will not be able to exceed amount borrowed http://t.co/CXxzEETqia
@andrewwmccallum don't worry,  you will - I receive hundreds of emails a week but I will respond (I do them in date order)
@citydaduk @itv_thismorning the 6 months is only from 6 months so the lack of flexibility means that doesn't work for many
@citydaduk @itv_thismorning indeed!
@GrantLeckie @vincecable in the EU countries, yes we have had peace
@datglynn @vincecable peace in the countries in the EU...
@ItsNiceOutUK @MadeForMums there's great guidance by @acasorguk on both shared parental leave and flexible working
@EmmaStewartTW @TomChivers agree flexible working is vital for many parents,  among others
@zoeimogen @lfeatherstone Thanks Zoe!  In good company!
@EdwardAdoo I'll have a look - did you use my parly address?
@phillrobertsli1 @totmac indeed - as Vince Cable so brilliantly outlines in this article http://t.co/3wvrLmBQA7
A powerful article by @vincecable on 70 years of peace guaranteed by the EU - and Britain's debate about immigration http://t.co/UgaTE3EGAc
Strong turnout for Remembrance service at Kirkintilloch war memorial - wreaths laid by those of all ages http://t.co/OZMx6BFhDt
Beautiful Remembrance Day service in Milngavie this morning - as well as wreaths laid also this knitted poppy tribute http://t.co/YltwNHGWat
A poignant day to remember all those killed and injured in the First World War and in all the conflicts since http://t.co/s2EIqeE5kL
@_ValentineSmith sorry, I don't know
@scottishbulll @murrayp77 yes, many times
@murrayp77 well I'm not the MP for most of those areas - I have knocked on doors in the Greens estate before
Fascinating discussion this week on "Is shared parental leave a good idea?" on @itv_thismorning - watch here: http://t.co/vmYkG445KY
@scottishbulll I knock on doors all over my constituency - tomorrow I'll be in Bishopbriggs & visited a school in Kirkintilloch this morning
@murrayp77 I do also knock on doors in Kirkintilloch - and as I tweeted earlier I was in St Ninian's this morning
@Pattmandhu I figured so, hence the smiley!
Wishing I'd remembered my gloves for evening knocking on doors in Milngavie - chilly fingers but a warm welcome!
@Pattmandhu thank you Patrick... I think ;-)
@sharkeyes00 and you'll see my Lib Dem colleague arguing against this as I have also done later (this specific article is before I was MP)
@k_tweetsdigital @Usborne @Govt_Women good to see wide range of careers promoted for girls
Enjoyed a lively visit this morning to @snmodstuds @stninianshs in Kirkintilloch - very politically engaged and switched on pupils #fb
Great article in the Scotsman by @amyhcallaghan on the excellent #GirlsMatter campaign that @Girlguiding are running: http://t.co/BblrxRTvtf
@frannie_annie88 we gave councils £6.7m to tackle rogue landlords: 6,500 props inspected, 1,700 l/lords facing more action/prosecution
@l_salerno have checked - your correspondence is in system and you will receive a reply (though only record of one letter, fairly recently)
@MelGladwin @rhiannonlucyc :-)
@GrantLeckie @rhiannonlucyc no I don't - feel free to double check exactly what I (and every other MP) claim: http://t.co/8ESfcys0oA
@SianSteans @marcfairclough flattered!
@radiofourfan @BBCRadio4 @Marthakearney @NickyMorgan01 @andyburnhammp very interesting and civilised panelists ;-)
@frannie_annie88 looking forward to it!
@rhiannonlucyc I laughed out loud at the "if men wore tights" bit - and so true!
@JournoLink @Govt_Women Thanks!
@k_tweetsdigital Cheers Katie!
@BillAlexander4 what's your question?
Looking forward to doing post-PMQs discussion on #wato @BBCRadio4 with @Marthakearney @NickyMorgan01 & @andyburnhammp
@Iain_33 delighted at @lfeatherstone  promotion - very well deserved!
@andrewwmccallum absolutely - what's your email address?
Compelling article by @rhiannonlucyc on "woman tax" http://t.co/iBOwqocHQ1 - totally brilliant section on tights in particular...
@PatricksPeople I voted to agree to the Iraqi govt's request for assistance with air strikes to deal with the scourge of ISIL in Iraq only
Fantastic images: Disney heroines redrawn by @LorynBrantz - highlights quite how extreme the originals are http://t.co/ieWEKLE3VK

No excuse for companies not to be aware of their gender pay gap - free software available to all companies http://t.co/n1EWDdN5ew
@ptg1888 I abstained due to Ministerial conventions on this, but Lib Dem colleagues voted 27 – 1 in favour!
@lynnjadams @bisgovuk @Lifelandlady @SLTAssociation yes (though DTI no longer exists) - it's devolved as I said to you a few months ago
Delighted that ad industry taking seriously need for more diversity in advertising - @CredosThinks report here: http://t.co/I1a4Fzkcqo
@DebraClaridge @rochellemonte these investigations very complex (many workers etc) & take long time - many started long before 1 Oct ongoing
@DebraBourne @allwalkscatwalk @Caryn_Franklin lovely pic too!
@kazjohnson @RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems brilliant riposte Kaz!
@Caryn_Franklin @tara_kaufmann sorry didn't get your tweet in time!
@lynnjadams @bisgovuk @Lifelandlady @SLTAssociation it is not competition law
@RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems or not change how you feed your baby just because some people weirdly take offence at this inoffensive act
@lynnjadams @bisgovuk @Lifelandlady @SLTAssociation no, it's just that they have the power to act on this in Scotland - that's devolution
@RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems a) breastfeeding mums shouldn't be forced to hide b) where do you think these "restrooms" exist? V.few...
@RantinScot Post Office Ltd remains 100% publicly owned - you're confusing with totally separate company Royal Mail
@mickjosephkds @jienewton1980 just not true to suggest this is going ahead - no permission has been given
@jienewton1980 there aren't any proposals to do so - happy to elaborate further if you drop me an email Jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk
@grenmartens @bbc5live delighted to hear it
@JosephJODonnell @bbc5live people can take offence at anything - doesn't mean we should restrict what people do accordingly
@RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems "rest"room? Or do you mean toilet? Do you eat your lunch in the gents?
@duguidt there's no proposal to do so
Pleased to see @PostOffice are making banking easier for customers http://t.co/QkX9zpOdJ6
@l_salerno @LibDems good point - or even LGBT*...
@DebraClaridge @JennyWillott the new rules on naming apply to investigations begun from 1 Oct 2013 onwards
@RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems maybe some do - but that's not a reason for that baby not to be fed when they need to be
@grenmartens @bbc5live well on Twitter it seems mainly men who have a problem with it - uncomfortable with breasts in non-sexual context?
@JosephJODonnell @bbc5live I fail to see how feeding a baby is offensive to anyone - would they rather the baby went hungry?
@sharkeyes00 MPs got 1% not 11%
@kitterati indeed - he was even fairly well behaved on the plane!
@sharkeyes00 ensuring good pensions in public sector continue to be sustainable is how I'd characterise it
@MissLilySummers it's fine and I understand the frustration because too often it *is* left out (as is the biphobia)
@MissLilySummers no probs :-)
@mashinka1976 fair enough - still plenty time to decide
@ProCEEdc @FamChildTrust @EYEearlyEd it was on Twitter
@sharkeyes00 I've not changed my view on this, and don't agree with how you characterise it
@kitterati Thanks for the tweet - lovely to meet you and good luck to you & especially Nicola for 24th Nov (or whatever date baby decides!)
@davidmyers27 @bbc5live ridiculous comparison - would you feed a baby a bottle in public or suggest that has to be in private too?
@DevoyPaul fantastic
@nothorridhenry @sarahlicity PSED is in place and intact - you can read govt review here: https://t.co/XjGNlvJdQJ
@Gasperoni27 @bbc5live @cass_cann ah yes,  the "exhibitionists" http://t.co/2gsGW55lCx
@RayJBray @bbc5live @LibDems I've fed my son in public many times - what's the problem? Where's the reason to take offence?
@Banks7Gary @bbc5live totally with you @cass_cann and @Rookesta
@l_salerno very sorry you've not had a reply - that's not good! Email me jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk mentioning this Twitter chat
@lynnjadams @bisgovuk @Lifelandlady @SLTAssociation confused Lynn - SNP logo on yr pic but they're the ones taking no action on this!
@RossforTaunton @SirGusODonnell @WhatWorksWB good point!  A shame - the real GO'D would be great on Twitter
@CatFlaherty @NickyMorgan01 schools and organisations can bid for money to run & evaluate projects to build evidence base of what works best
@LaCatholicState @NickyMorgan01 @educationgovuk of course - and govt also doing lots of work on bullying generally too
@chalmersgirl @Concordmoose @NickyMorgan01 @educationgovuk @pinknews and this project will help!
@JonathanPSharp Ministers can't sign EDMs but I'll certainly raise the issue if you email me (inc address)
@l_salerno @LibDems the article does say - depending on what else in tweet sometimes homophobic, biphobic & transphobic doesn't all fit...
@MattSanders_ @HulbertMathew Thanks for posting the link Matt! And good point Mathew
@MissLilySummers as article says, the project is to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying so absolutely not being ignored
@ekenny6 @NCS @LiberalYouth Thanks Emma - great to see you@
@rfwebster @LibDems it won't be in all schools yet - plan is to test interventions,  build evidence base that can then be used to roll out
@kav2216 @LibDems or a really important issue that hugely affects people's quality of life
@alyzande @LibDems @julianhuppert I think the successful anti-HBTbullying interventions are a bit more sophisticated than that
@AstonMannerings :-)
@ChrisRWhiting @LibDems quite - the 'whole school' integrated approach seems to be effective from research so far
@mashinka1976 @catmacisaac @WilliamKilbride what did you tell them?
@JPSmudge @NickyMorgan01 sounds great
@KirstyMac87x As a Minister I abstained as is convention. However, Lib Dems support Palestine & peace with Israel http://t.co/dXIMRbMwX1
@Clanranald just noticed it had been missed
Interesting research published today by @bisgovuk on workplace wellbeing, productivity & business performance: https://t.co/7H79dC99es
Excited to join @SirGusODonnell in launching @WhatWorksWB this morning - generating evidence base for policy-making #whatworks #wellbeing
@Clanranald I voted to agree to the Iraqi govt's request for assistance to deal with the scourge of ISIL
@loughegish1 Hi Leena, This is a priority for the Government. Do email me & I will send you more info: jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk
We must tackle homophobia in schools to create safe & supportive environment for young people: http://t.co/3vILA3Rtb4
@CEIRatSHU @Govt_Women great to have your contribution!
@proftinamiller @Govt_Equality Thanks for taking part!
@Robfm @Govt_Women I agree it would be good if more men were Gender Studies academics - nothing like equal numbers in this profession
@l_salerno we had some excellent discussion on these points at academic seminar this morning
@xtamsynx absolutely!
@Caryn_Franklin @tara_kaufmann @psychoanalysis we'll miss your input Caryn! But we'll publish results so you can see what is discussed
@g77sword Hello!
@latentexistence just saying Guide Dogs for the Blind have done a great job for many years & glad BIS employees fundraised for them
@robbill @jackgallagher88 no, raising tuition fees was a Tory & Labour policy but they got rather more MPs than us
@alibali50 @latentexistence @AnitaBellows12 what do those things have to do with Guide Dogs?
@latentexistence Guide Dogs for the Blind is a long-established charity
@jackgallagher88 you can read my full description of why I voted how I did on my website
@alfayezmo @FamChildTrust happy to take up any issue with the Council on behalf of constituents - email me jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk
@SpectatorSimon have you noticed you're wildly off topic? What does this have to do with shared parental leave?
@latentexistence charities play an important role in our society - are you basically saying govt should do everything & have no charities?
@jackgallagher88 it doesn't - we got 8% of MPs, so not able to implement 100% of our policies
@DebEDaniels what's your problem with govt raising awareness of a change in the law so people can benefit?
@LuxuryToaster @TheBabyShow exactly what @DaddyNatal and I suggested during the panel!
@GorkiDuhra this isn't the case for men under current system but is one of the issues that will be looked at when it is reviewed
@GorkiDuhra it's not leave for self-employed given they choose work hours anyway but women eligible for maternity allowance if self-employed
@GorkiDuhra indeed
Potential development of 140 homes on greenbelt on Tower Rd in Torrance: public exhibition of plans 3-7pm on Fri 31 Oct @CaldwellHalls #fb

Congratulations to @Women’s Aid on 40th Anniversary - delighted to attend their powerful exhibition in HoC this week
Women looking to start and grow a business will find lots of useful resources here: https://t.co/da8Qi2gXzf
Flamingos, marmosets or seahorses... who's the daddy?  http://t.co/PxZ4jW27H9
@ariadneassoc pretty simple - same as mat leave just shared between two, @acasorguk guidance great: http://t.co/rJ7LsT6Qtv
@duncanlugton extending to all employees should help normalise it: culture change needed and the more that ask the easier it becomes! #askjo
@FamChildTrust I'd love to! Lib Dem manifesto plans 6 wks paternity leave: though couples can also use SPL for dads to take more time #askjo
@GorkiDuhra this helps self-employed women as partners will be eligible for SPL which might make managing childcare easier #askjo
@FamChildTrust so far eligible couples are around 16 wks, may not have planned & announced work intentions yet - do hope they will #askjo
@FamChildTrust statutory parental pay is paid by govt, designed system to minimise admin, early chats should help employers plan too #askjo
@FamChildTrust plus there was a Downton Abbey #askjo Twitter conversation a few days ago with Jo Frogatt
@FamChildTrust these are rights you have - http://t.co/16JKm2EbIf has lots of good advice plus @acasorguk guidance http://t.co/rJ7LsT6Qtv
@FamChildTrust it's same as statutory paternity pay but we're encouraging employers that can to pay more - civil service leading the way
@domcgraham @TomChivers except before shared parental leave this choice wasn't available - and significant minority of women do earn more
@domcgraham yes but that doesn't equate to not working as I know from personal experience - can do both
@_SmallestThings I know, not saying it's easy at all
If you work for a family-friendly organisation you can nominate your employer for @DPMoffice Family Friendly Award http://t.co/t1ayI7smIN
@Liv_London do send them my best wishes esp Nancy and Matthew if they're there
@domcgraham @TomChivers and breastfeeding doesn't stop dads taking leave,  esp after earliest weeks when feeding becomes less constant
@_SmallestThings understand concerns: as well as 1yr maternity/shared parental leave, right to 18wks parental leave https://t.co/p5mL53kS0N
@TomChivers Thanks had meant to tweet link earlier - now done
Interesting article by @TomChivers - Why aren't more dads left holding the baby? http://t.co/tP7IqP9o4l
@A_C_McGregor @TomChivers that's one reason but not the only one
@Liv_London I now have the email - and what a small world with the SpaceandPeople connection - will reply soon
@SaorAlba_45Plus Thanks - slight delay as correspondence has been very busy post-ref but will get back to you asap
Interesting article by @TomChivers - Why aren't more dads left holding the baby?
@SaorAlba_45Plus if you're a constituent pls do email me for a detailed reply
@Cammy_Craig @nick_clegg private sector can set own policies but good for Civil Service to lead & give men parity with women on parental pay
Fantastic new support for women entrepreneurs looking to get their business off the ground: http://t.co/ozK6cicpi7
Great to launch @tsi_uk #businesscompanion today - helpful tool for business and reassuring for consumers too http://t.co/d42eIWlBAa
Proud that @nick_clegg has announced  that Civil Service mums & dads choosing to share parental leave will be entitled to enhanced pay
Looking forward to talking about#sharedparentalleave @TheBabyShow as part of panel discussion on Friday http://t.co/Tbys7Z46Oj
@ChrisJames_90 indeed I loved that tweet!
@womensaid it's a powerful exhibition
Note to @TelegraphNews - what Liz Truss happened to be wearing at Cabinet is not "news" @EverydaySexism http://t.co/z2rx3ZOjU3
@KiddyCharts @KatiePrentice2 @CatParrott @StorkTV legally people have a right to take the leave - though need to change culture too
@KiddyCharts @CarlaRTOATSblog absolutely!

@emmaharper it is,  thanks for email address. Are you in Sweden yet?  Or was it Norway?
@MymumforPM @LibDems @UKHouseofLords I agree we need more women in parliament and it would improve representativeness of debate
@GoldenFool88 when people post explicit photos of a former partner online without consent
@emmaharper I'll look into it - can you send me your postal or email address so I can reply properly?
@catherinharwood great
@nicstevenson @MenCanDoItBook @duncanhames totally agree! I understand you were in touch with my team at BIS today :-)
@nicstevenson @MenCanDoItBook it is magic having all day to have adventures with a little person, miss it now back at work
@nicstevenson @MenCanDoItBook v.interesting - my husband @duncanhames also gets a range of odd / patronising comments when out with our son
@charlotteahenry fab!
@charlotteahenry @Bobby_Dean all well here Charlotte (sleeping baby, always a good start to the night!), hope it goes well, agree grim topic
@charlotteahenry good luck Charlotte! What's the topic?
@nicstevenson there are examples but you'll be a bit of a pioneer - have you read @MenCanDoItBook ?
@AminahKhan238 Thanks - will have a look.  Do make sure you've included your address.
@ollybenson @JoffHopkins @nicstevenson fascinating blog! And delighted to hear about people sharing parental leave
@NoMorePage3 @Timobru very well put NMP3!
@spmca1976 very soon - apologies it's taken longer than usual as there was a big increase in correspondence just after referendum
@quizicist @Govt_Women @MumsnetBloggers which is good - though obv huge need for more women in science generally http://t.co/0wxBoKh849
@catherinharwood have you tried local MP who may have venues to suggest?
@FinancialBear @Govt_Equality agree causes complex though all have links to body dysmorphia and societal pressures on appearance
@DebraClaridge @johnleechmcr it was part of wider debate on NMW - this link should take you to most relevant bit http://t.co/lz8Srihi0v
@ClarkQuadGirls @TheBabyShow we are very happy with our choice of Bugaboo Bee, though the Ergobaby arguably best travel aid we've bought
@Liv_London I haven't seen it yet but am checking with my staff in case they've picked it up
@ClarkQuadGirls @TheBabyShow or even a quiet chat... last time I was at the Baby Show we were trying to work out which buggy to get!
Good chats with residents on the doorstep in Torrance this morning - now off to my surgery at the @caldwellhalls til 12:30pm
@ClarkQuadGirls @TheBabyShow looking forward to it!
@FinancialBear @seanjones11kbw @Govt_Equality different data sources, illustrating different manifestations of the same problem
@Cathymccabe6 @acasorguk pretty straightforward - parents can choose how to split leave and ACAS have produce great guidance to assist
@seanjones11kbw @Govt_Equality yes
@MahyarRezaei1 @seanjones absolutely,  the causes of this are complex but media culture definitely has an impact
@BiggusMannus no problem, I like to engage when I can!
@ArtsAtRandom @MumsnetBloggers I agree - NCT groups and such like really helpful
@luweasel @BeReal_Campaign depends, selfies can be a fun way to capture & share a moment, but for some approval-seeking can get out of hand
@englishoak most of equalities work is reserved not devolved
@englishoak accountability is through Parliament - e.g. we had women & equality Qs yesterday, MPs from all over UK attend & ask Qs
@LibDemSimon @Govt_Equality disability discrimination also a significant problem, not sure of that exact stat though
@luweasel social media puts a filter on the norm, so easy for people to alter images - important to remember to what's real @BeReal_Campaign
@englishoak @Govt_Equality I support a federal UK - long-standing Lib Dem policy
@youngbodyimage @Govt_Equality it is truly shocking: need to stop cycle of young people internalising that their value lies in how they look
@Ergofrances @Govt_Equality https://t.co/WTGpzN6K2u https://t.co/RgqCbAJiDk https://t.co/alIyYspR5H
@englishoak @Govt_Equality Equality covers all protected characteristics, lots happening to tackle FGM such as: https://t.co/q0IZQvTnyf
.@Govt_Equality 4,500 teenage girls develop eating disorder each yr, steroid users doubling each yr, cosmetic surgery quadrupled in 10yrs
@Ergofrances @Govt_Equality this isn't about blame, quite opposite - this is part of a wider cultural issue of how we respect & value women
@WeightDebate @Govt_Equality glad you agree - there are always some who try to minimise its importance
@_CurleyHannah education has a crucial role to play as well as parents, and doing our bit to change the image-obsessed culture we live in
.@Govt_Equality @englishoak body image impacts on health, education & self-esteem of girls, boys, men & women https://t.co/8G2Lx2W2kR
@Ergofrances @Govt_Equality it's far from the only issue we work on https://t.co/gyTaLOPhMz - but it is important to many
@clairehporter if misleading in advertising a product, you can complain: http://t.co/6WJ0bxqHkB - also make your views known to mag editors
@karenpartyka glad you enjoyed it!
@DebraClaridge @johnleechmcr all complaints to Pay & Work Rights Helpline investigated - call 0800 917 2368 and higher penalties too
@DebraClaridge @johnleechmcr Ministers can't sign EDMs but we are taking action - as I said in HoC this week, new guidance out soon, plus
@_SelfEsteemTeam @mrjamesob @therealgokwan @tes well done!
@SulemanSujad @Govt_Equality @Govt_Women we agree!
@roseannmcinty15 MPs don't vote on their pay - Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority sets it, 1% rise this year
@HRBullets yes it was fun!
@feministfox @jjmitchell @Wonkypolicywonk @casparglyn @MoJGovUK not pass the parcel at all - MoJ are also lead dept for ET fees themselves
@WRhadwen @Wonkypolicywonk one reason why we're developing a Code of Practice on ZHCs
@GoldenFool88 given the cross-party agreement the extra powers *will* be delivered and there is a majority in the HoC to do so
@Wonkypolicywonk @casparglyn @feministfox don't worry, I don't think that
@BiggusMannus Lib Dem view on this pretty clear - http://t.co/fk91W0o7Ei
Join my twitter Q&A tonight at 6:30pm @Govt_Equality to talk about #bodyconfidence. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! #BeReal
@neil1pat all published on http://t.co/OVBwVGpdo0 - though with noting "expenses" is not earnings: incudes staff salaries,  office rent etc
@GoldenFool88 as per timetable - Smith Commission reports agreement by end Nov, draft legislation by end Jan to be debated & passed after GE
@roseannmcinty15 actuality we've asked Low Pay Commission to look at how to increase it,  as our evidence published yesterday made clear
@HRBullets Cheers Craig - though I confess it was my first "hangout"!
@dadbloguk yes good to "see" you again!  All good here thanks - just amazing watching a little person develop!
@casparglyn @feministfox @Wonkypolicywonk @MoJGovUK the Ministerial lead is Shailesh Vara
Tonight's #BodyConfidenceAwards are a wonderful opportunity for those who want to make a difference to share ideas & experiences #BeReal
@joninetyone @BQLive interesting - £3.50 an hour in 1984 sounds much better than my £2.70 an hour in 1997!
@peterbrownbarra the rise in employment suggests into work
@Alconcalcia not saying everything is fixed but yes, it's good news that more are in work (and most new jobs FT)
@roseannmcinty15 did nothing of the sort! Voted against a highly partisan motion with flawed ideas on how best to encourage higher pay
@ilaria_miller @Bispressoffice @EITIorg @bisgovuk @BHRRC absolutely! They've been superb!
@peterbrownbarra I disagree - I think more people in work is good - for both the individuals and the wider economy
@MissLauraMarcus @timfarron I didn't see it sadly but sounds like it was good
@TimLawTax @bisgovuk @EITIorg @PWYPtweets @BP_plc absolutely and that will continue - the stakeholder group have been really constructive
@citizennauld yes it was great - the girls really enjoyed it
@Mistera22 @LibDems @EITIorg @PWYPtweets @BP_plc @bisgovuk more transparency in payments made to governments by extractives industry
@Wonkypolicywonk @HRBullets Thanks :-)
@jhowze @BritMums Thanks for a great hangout
@weegordi I didn't speak - govt ministers not allowed to speak in areas outside their Ministerial role
@JackTorbet @EITIorg @PWYPtweets @BP_plc @bisgovuk we have a further 18 months to collate and publish first report and then it gets assessed
@feministfox @casparglyn @Wonkypolicywonk as you know @MoJGovUK are in charge of this policy area and the review
Excellent news today that unemployment down by 154,000 to under 2 million #strongereconomy #fairersociety

@andyw1 @JennyWillott or even a top priority (damn you predictive text!)
@MissLauraMarcus @timfarron Thanks!
@andyw1 Thanks for all your work on this too - and @JennyWillott made this a top priory
@AstonMannerings no - in my time I have had folk working for me who are Scottish, English, Welsh, N.Irish, Canadian & French
@weegordi yes, though not all of it sadly as was in a Bill Committee
@tim_rigby @pzj_1 yet ;-)
@_PT32 congratulations and enjoy! (And it does get easier...)
@antonyhook yes!
@LauraCT1984 there were quite a lot of MPs there for the summation speeches,  certainly most Scottish MPs
@LauraCT1984 no, I'm sure many MPs, like me, would have liked to attend more of debate but had other commitments (I was in Bill Committee) &
@pzj_1 no it often takes a few weeks
@pzj_1 your understanding is wrong, they have not replied yet as far as I know

Fantastic that gov action in #modernslavery bill means businesses will have to publish their actions to tackle slavery in supply chains

@DebraBourne @EverydaySexism @guardian Cheers Debra,  hope you're well and see you soon
@pzj_1 I've replied but EDC haven't yet - as i said if constituents email me I'll send a copy of the reply when it arrives
@pzj_1 no and I'm utterly confused why you've said I'm not replying when I've emailed several constituents on this
@BiggusMannus govt agreed to abstain as backbench business, non-govt Lib Dems had free vote and voted 27-1 in favour of recognition

@ValWilkinson1 Thanks Val, yes loving it thanks
@Paul_Bowen I know, couldn't quite believe my eyes
@BiggusMannus all government ministers abstained
@DamianAStuart they were covering my conference speech - keep up!
It's body confidence week, read more about @BeReal_Campaign on the @Govt_Equality Facebook page: http://t.co/8QCG5Fy8Rf

Flexible working is beneficial to business and employees. My piece for @redmagdaily on making it work http://t.co/AcJPJ5MJ6H
@LeeCrawfurd believe us because we've already delivered this for 40% of 2 year olds

@bobbyjay5621 Thanks Bob
@bobbyjay5621 Job Centre ought to be able to advise - depends on circs of course but part-time or flexible work may be an option
@Wonkypolicywonk @feministfox @casparglyn indeed, and lead dept on this is MoJ not BIS so they'll be launching the review
@Wonkypolicywonk @feministfox @casparglyn a motion on Monday did commit LDs to review of fees so as not to deter genuine claims
@cllrjaybaker @5050Parliament Thanks!
@Kav_Kaushik :-( get well soon!
@cllrjaybaker @TerenceMcleod great stuff Justine - delighted you're standing
@tim_rigby agree first woman leader and PM was huge achievement - but it isn't enough on its own
@Clairefrome Thanks Claire!
@DavidGWrigley it does nothing of the sort!
@DavidGWrigley coalition govt as public didn't vote for any party to have a majority
@PhylMeyer @internaware to be fair i did say at least!
@tim_rigby yes - many Tories' opposition to shared parental leave spoke volumes about their view of women
@StephanieFraser @TerenceMcleod well said Stephanie! Miriam was brilliant at an event on Monday inspiring local schoolgirls
@CSWilliams111 @hindlea if you look back on what I said I think you'll find I always gave Osborne the 'credit' for that particular policy
@Charlielums97 yes, the list goes on
@TomBellwood yes all well here thanks - #ldconf was great
@anthea_bailey @silverstrivers no, I was just there seeing the resistance from Tories making it happen and won't let then rewrite history
@suchan104 @silverstrivers it was hard fought for by Lib Dems in govt whatever Tories trying to claim now
@Carameliney exactly - it's all about families making their own choices
@suchan104 @silverstrivers yes but they didn't agree outright - had to negotiate for it and they wanted something in return
@silverstrivers I'm speaking from my experience in govt: the Tories' tax cut was for the rich - we made the £10k threshold happen - and more
@HelenCFinch true which is why I made a point of making the point in my speech (to warm applause from Lib Dem audience)
@Monty_Jennings they still can take more time off - but if dad taking more time works better for a family they now have that choice
@silverstrivers so why did we have to drag them into cutting tax for low earners?
@Brianthecat @tom_watson still is for vast majority of them
@TheForagersKitc I agree choices for families is the important thing - shared parental leave increases choice
@TomBellwood not if it had been less tall
@TerenceMcleod hardly - you're just reinforcing exactly the point I was making about Tories assuming men should be at work and women at home
@NadineMCSmith @acas we def need to encourage culture change to make it feel easier to ask
@Tory_Hater not to my knowledge
@19Pablo86 do email me at jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk incl your address, and I'll happily make representations on your behalf to the council
@HelenCFinch as I said in speech ,these changes to share paternal leave rightly apply to same sex couples (and adopters) too
@TomBellwood that's very charitable!  Could have had the photo across two columns if they wanted a different shape
@Londonworms @TerenceMcleod yes Mr McLeod is rather presumptuous and pretty dismissive of dads' contribution
@Angelheartnight @ManBot6000 well said - dads hugely important
@anthea_bailey @TheRetroExec clear benefit to economy of parents working so sensible to help with childcare, tho not main point of my speech
@sosaysSWB Thanks glad you liked the speech
@TheForagersKitc lots of parents feel they can't afford to go back to work so childcare help gives choices
@TerenceMcleod why mums not dads?
@andyjameshicks @timfarron it's allowed!  :-)
@ProfAndyField Thanks Andy - of course @Mailonline interpreted it as attack on stay at home mums...
@19Pablo86 I'm the MP for Bishopbriggs,  not a Cllr (there are 6 of those) - can I help with something?
@zoeimogen afraid not - too little sleep this week between #ldconf and 9-month baby so have headed home
@carlbrownism Thanks Carl
@LGBTLD Thanks for your help and sorry I had to head off after doorknocking to speak at a fringe
@rebeccalees @BBCWomansHour Thanks!
@Liz4Stratford @CBItweets lovely to meet you Liz!
@zoeimogen Thanks for your help Zoe!
Couldn't make it up: Daily Mail covered my speech re dads being ignored & literally cut my husband out of the picture http://t.co/XkOR0GyXfN
@stellacreasy @Dawn_Barnes no - of course lots more to do, don't want to stop at 25% either but good to celebrate progress
@hocwatch I disagree - people on 50k with a £2 million+ home are very well off compared to vast majority of people
@Tomwill25 Thanks!
@fucktheuaf @bbcdp because I left school 17 years ago
@TerenceMcleod the Mail headline doesn't actually reflect what I said if you read my quotes

@NadineMCSmith 3 in 5 approved upfront, another 1 in 5 after negotiation - new @ACAS guidance on this very clear and worth a look

@duguidt that's up to the voters in East Dunbartonshire, which of course includes Bishopbriggs
@mpntod delighted to have your company and support!
@JROAshton @EnlightBystand I think it's all online
@richdick Thanks!
@Doctorwhizz no
@curtisdeleon3 a wonderful challenge!
@realmarkdoc not sure what your point is?
@po8crg true - I don't tend to use the acronym!
@HRMcKnight @Wonkypolicywonk @asabenn @HuffPostUKPol indeed - I expect take-up will increase year on year as culture changes
@GregorMcNie @vincecable @cruk @CRUKGlasgow it was a fascinating visit as ever!
Excellent #ldconf address by @acarmichaelmp and @willie_rennie on Scotland after the referendum http://t.co/6uVB2hQzpw
on way to #ldconf watching #Glasgow10k runners climb ramp to motorway - tough hill! though part of me wishes I was running it... lovely race
@mcgiggle89 no, I don't think there's any need for that kind of aggression on Twitter,  even when people disagree
@Shrewsmeditate @Govt_Women extending flexible working so more the norm will help, agree still an issue that PT work not valued sufficiently
@Les_Gilbert @MarcusFysh to be fair, this right is to unpaid time off for 2 ante-natal appointments so not costly to employers
@LibDemSimon no excuse for that either!
@AmyGoold Sky, ITV and BBC all have recorded footage & interviews they can use - was live on @GoodMornBritain & BBC radio
@Liv_London great - in the first case why don't you email me with a little bit about yourself and I can send you some ideas!
@butterworth_n tl absolutely! Only so much you can fit in 140 chars though!
New rules on #equalpay law came in this week. There's simply no excuse for employers who pay less because of #gender http://t.co/lDdy8rtSQc
@Liv_London but is it a particular issue you want to do stuff on?
On radio & TV this morning discussing new right for dads-to-be to have time off work to attend two ante-natal appointments #fb
@AngeBlue55 @Stiv2014 @ColonelKurtz64 @KGMan71 @pzj_1 @geom66 @PZJ I may if the volume of tweets continues as it has today!
@mackayac motion published, working towards white paper by St Andrews day and draft bill by Burns Night
@enablerbro1 depends on the specific circs but certainly doesn't sound right - @CABAction can advise: http://t.co/eNmX7aDbvX or 03454 040506
@milngavie Thanks!
@BiggusMannus obv Iraqi govt key to combat ISIL threat esp on the ground, but as they want help from RAF think we're right to support them
@BiggusMannus not sure exact figures without checking but it will be publicly available info
Happy @OlderPeoplesDay ! Really great to see so many people celebrating the value of older people in society
Happy 2nd anniversary to @EASShelpline who've helped 60,000 people seeking advice & support on equality issues http://t.co/mFZ8zFpx3d
@BigHorace not to worry - she has the world at her feet and all sorts of choices! Tell her I hope she'll feel empowered to follow her dreams
@BiggusMannus my understanding is that it shouldn't be revealed
@BiggusMannus diplomacy and urging both sides to talk is in my view the only way it will ultimately be resolved - what action do you want?
@bradley_steve email bounced, but that plan for tomorrow sounds great!
@milngavie done!
@jamiemchale here is the motion: http://t.co/5sJg1ckbxH
@Missmimothy thanks - I have asked HMRC to follow up
Reply to @gmaemack it was one answer to a qu from a 20 min i/view & I said it existed in some parts, which is true, not that it was common
@BiggusMannus of course want to see resolution for Palestine too though it is a deep-rooted complex issue there & needs intense diplomacy
@BiggusMannus this is a very specific situation responding to Iraqi govt request for help to combat ISIL
@spmca1976 @Baljanxmissile Thanks
@KimberleyMills1 sorry you feel like that & happy to discuss on email - Iraqi civilians need protection & their govt has asked us to help
@RetailJohn I don't think Iraq is at peace now which is why their govt has asked us and others for help to combat ISIL
@BiggusMannus appreciate you may take a different view on whether to assist Iraqi govt, but would you rather I didn't reply to tweets?
@spmca1976 @Baljanxmissile happy to set out why I believe agreeing to Iraqi govt request for help us right thing to do- just email me
@scottg1975 @pzj_1 I engage with lots of people on Twitter
@Fab_and_Frugal @tweetingacho happy to explain why I think agreeing to Iraqi govt request for assistance is right thing to do: just email me
@weegie_panda happy to set out my reasons for voting to agree to Iraqi govt request for help if you send me an email
@Baljanxmissile I believe it is the right thing to do to agree to Iraqi govt request for assistance - happy to explain further if you email
@milngavie good point - have been away for a few days hols but will change pic when get to my laptop
@BareReality great will be in touch
@Baljanxmissile that's right, no invasion.  Iraqi govt has asked for assistance which we will be providing
Simply brilliant. @EmWatson speech at @UN - brimming with passion & raw power of words spoken directly from the heart http://t.co/x7t8HNtDGQ
@BareReality what an inspiring project!
@Baljanxmissile there wasn't any vote about Syria?
@chrisjlovell @scotlibdems Cheers Chris - glad you liked the card and thanks again for your help!
@GSU_Welfare @FathersNetScot @heraldscotland @EmWatson @OPFSUSTOGETHER @HeforShe this isn't about child custody...
@BigHorace Thank you lots - what a lovely tweet!  How old is your daughter?  Is she on Twitter?
@Liv_London what in particular do you want to help with?
@PatricksPeople yes I rejoice in 91% turnout, glad we voted No, as I believe Scotland's best future is in UK, appreciate others may disagree
@pzj_1 that surprises me - who hasn't had any reply?
@Liv_London @StylistMagazine I agree we can't wait that long!
@StylePsychology there's been some interesting pilots of resilience education in schools
@justinpgdr @LibDems @StylistMagazine @UKParliament a big issue we're tackling but want to do even more
@hannee24 delighted to hear it!
@Natasha_Akhtar @StylistMagazine Thanks Natasha
@BiggusMannus I agree but UK is a country too
@joannex7x sure Jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk
@BIS_Annie rather sad!
@LookFabForever Thanks!
@susydoll1206 and I really am happy to discuss all of this in more detail if you want to come to surgery / send email
@susydoll1206 @EDCouncil not sure what you mean? There's no register of how people vote - people can access the list of who voted though
@susydoll1206 I don't support indy and won't - but also will be working to ensure those promises are kept
@susydoll1206 different papers have different positions - but that is always true editorially
@KarenHurst indeed ;-) just as well...
@jhurstcoaching @thesundaytimes Thanks Jacqueline
@susydoll1206 I don't agree, though understand your deep disappointment with the result - happy to discuss these issues anytime at a surgery
@The_GP @jimmurphymp yes we need to come together now
@The_GP @jimmurphymp indeed - horrendous images
@jimmytabuk @jimmurphymp utterly condemn violence
@johnashaw2 agree we must deliver the extra powers
@PrueBray that's certainly the plan!
@LikeYourFitness @UK_Together indeed!
@LibralLady witness?  You helped deliver it! :-)
@LibralLady @BelindaBG your help much appreciated - hope you enjoyed the sleeper train back down south
@bryantookey yes after being up for so many hours you just hope you're still speaking in sentences!
@mc_iona @EDCouncil @UK_Together @ED_Together Morag!  Dastardly Samsung autocorrect...

@mc_iona @EDCouncil @UK_Together Thanks Moray - and huge thanks to all the @ED_Together volunteers!
@CSouthernLD agree
@JulianHeather1 I was so delighted by that!
@nicolatoner7 Thanks - well done East Dunbartonshire!
@DomWeldon Cheers
@jamesaboyle71 indeed - especially with highest turnout in Scotland too!
@GMJacobAagaard Thanks Jacob - and many thanks to you and Anne for all your help
@_martinellis if, as looking increasingly likely, Scotland votes no, then yes we will get on with delivering more powers
Result from East Dunbartonshire NO 61% (48314) YES 39% (30624) - excellent!  #fb
@MattMcCallion @RuthDavidsonMSP @JohannLamont indeed - change is certain!

@VictoriaJYoung Thanks Victoria!  Appreciate your help - and you'll be welcome back in the run up to the election too!

@H_Bettsworth Thanks - hope Spain is treating you well
@AndyMcNee not a chance - staying up for East Dunbartonshire result then off to BBC
@andershanson Cheers!
@SO_1888 @GerryBraiden how charming! We don't have result yet but they didn't all vote yes - far from it!
@BelindaBG @chrisjlovell @scotlibdems Thanks so much for all your help!
East Dunbartonshire turnout confirmed as 91% (79011 votes) - fantastic! #fb
@BillAlexander4 well we've certainly argued case for federalism for years!  Though I think it's Scotland that would be main beneficiary
@dr_dyb I don't see anything wrong with campaigning on polling day - obv as long as no intimidation
@FloClucas @Parklands_Ward @timfarron Cheers
@Morven_MacAskil would be wonderful if so!
@LikeYourFitness @JohannLamont @Ed_Miliband we will - it starts tomorrow!
@MacSpadger indeed it has! And inspiring to see so many people voting
@Gary_McLelland @eastrenlibdems Thanks for all your help!
@BammiePam @UK_Together @KeepStJoes :-)
@dr_dyb they're outside not inside - both sides have people there
Wow, turnout looks amazing! Been to Bearsden, Milngavie & Balmore polling stations - most recent ones >90% voted #inspiring #democracy #fb
@BammiePam @UK_Together @KeepStJoes *she* will have done I'm sure as she is of Russian descent
Big kudos to @UK_Together volunteer Iain Sinclair - at St Joseph's Primary polling station in Milngavie since 6:45am & staying til 10pm #fb
Reaching far and wide, one of our @UK_Together volunteers did an interview about indyref today for Ukrainian TV - in Russian!
@MarshShelley @georginaorso yes very distinctive architecture beautifully silhouetted against the sunrise!
@amyelizgray a good sign!
@mc_iona it will be counted in Bishopbriggs at the Leisuredrome - I heard around 2:30am but if very high turnout could be a bit later
Great feedback from polling stations in Bishopbriggs, Auchinairn, Lenzie, Kirkintilloch & Torrance: really high turnout so far #libdemno #fb
@Fab_and_Frugal regardless of result today I'll keep working for East Dunbartonshire and communicating with local people
@BelindaBG @LibralLady Thank you both lots - hope our paths cross later!
@jimuk530 Thanks for the compliment but would rather keep working for Scotland as part of the UK
@YadBYadUK what?
@DecoMc all part of the democratic process - we'll both await the result with interest
@mc_iona @vincecable @UK_Together great stuff - and fun idea!
Can you help secure a 'No' vote today for Scotland's future? Helpers welcome @ 5 Chapelton Gdns, Bearsden G61 2DH - pop in anytime til 10pm
Enjoyed speaking with voters in Bishopbriggs today, joined by @vincecable - lots of support for @UK_Together
@georginaorso really appreciate all your help - sleep well #earlystart

Great buzz with lots of volunteers out and about across East Dunbartonshire today fit @UK_Together
Welcome news from the @ASA_UK tackling copycat websites http://t.co/WnBm4upxjY. Always use @GOVUK for your services and applications
@FewArePict yes, and they have been very careful legally not to say I made the claims as they have the evidence that I didn't
@thehighlandway1 whatever the result I think both sides need to come together to work for Scotland afterwards
@LibralLady @BelindaBG it'll be great to have your help too Amanda!
@JTaylor_001 @nusuk worrying stats and experiences for students, though glad NUS are highlighting and tackling the issue
@davymains others haven't perceived it that way, but you're entitled to your opinion!
@chrisjlovell @UK_Together @scotlibdems Cheers for your help Chris!

@glesgacroft @FewArePict actually the online claim forms prove everything
@astropoet I know,  but you'd favourite a tweet that did so wanted to set the record straight
@glesgacroft @FewArePict you can check for yourself - all the claim forms are online, the Mail don't do apologies unless they have to
@ross_stalker great - will get Emma from the Lib Dem office to get in touch on Monday
@FewArePict @astropoet I often reply,  but it's not practical to reply to every tweet,  not least on days when no time to check Twitter
@FewArePict funnily enough I do take exception to people spreading lies about me
@astropoet fair enough to have political differences, I just take exception to people spreading lies about me
@ross_stalker you'll not be surprised to hear you'll be very welcome in East Dunbartonshire!  When are you free?
@gmc1876 @Zinaad you can keep your head in the sand all you like, it doesn't change the reality
@MarianDougan many thanks on both counts!
@FewArePict actually you tweeted that I claimed it which is a lie
@bbrown511 charming, not only spreading lies about me but sending abusive tweets too - par for the course from cybernats #growup
@Tracey94249526 Thanks - easy for unfounded and false claims to spread so I appreciate your tweet
@FewArePict actually you do - anyone publishing (includes Twitter) should not defame others - but perhaps you don't mind spreading lies
@MarianDougan Cheers for all your help!  The letters you did are being delivered in Bishopbriggs tomorrow
@FarrellStephen obviously up to you how you vote, do let me know if I can ever be of any help as your MP even though we disagree on #indyref

@martin_rob1 budget has gone up every year
@gmc1876 Tesco not the only place it has been suggested - of course cost model would be different across Scotland as opposed to all of UK
@CraigQuinn @dannyalexander @BBCr4today think people want to know what iScotland would mean for household budgets
@martin_rob1 you need to check your sums
@joerowan89 no

@RadicalScotland @scotlibdems it's not as if we've only just started campaigning!
@gmc1876 refuted by whom? Just check out prices of groceries in Ireland, or listen to John Lewis boss on radio this morning
@x44dav not capable? Believing pooling resources, risks & opportunities across UK is best for Scotland is not same as saying not capable

@_PatrickThomas @mojomums @bisgovuk what do you think is confusing?
@no2tories @duncanlean get your facts straight - there has been no such vote and no such payrise
@x44dav not really sure why you think that
@GraemeCampbell_ @FinancialTimes this says Scotland would need same rules on budget deficit & debt as rUK - hardly what Yes proposing
@peter_mcphee well I said that corporation tax receipts should go to Scottish Parliament - did you actually watch the debate?
@oilfieldhirer @YouTube as you'll know I said corporation tax receipts should go to Scottish Parliament
@_PatrickThomas @mojomums @bisgovuk true but APL also inflexible - e.g. only after 6mths and couldn't take concurrently with mat leave
@NsNrs1 @workingfamUK indeed - so good to see it happen and credit to those who campaigned for it and worked to make it happen
@GoldenFool88 @jimmurphymp @UK_Together there certainly is - setting out how Scotland benefits from being part of UK
@Grumpyhatlady @jimmurphymp no, I didn't want to tempt fate
Great response for @UK_Together in Milngavie this morning and Bearsden this afternoon
Now on way back to Glasgow for public meeting on #indyref in Balmore ( Baldernock Church Hall) - 7pm, all welcome http://t.co/Zenrc8m8Q7 #fb
Glad to support my Lib Dem colleague Andrew George's Affordable Housing Bill today - it successfully passed Second Reading
Excellent article in @FinancialTimes  explains why currency union not in iScotland's interest: http://t.co/vDxacmn7fE 
@xtamsynx good to meet you and put a face to the twitter ID!
@katergraham @StylistMagazine fab - send it to Jo.swinson.mp@parliament.uk
Good turnout in Kirky for @jimmurphymp - happily fairly good-natured debate from most so far http://t.co/dcHTfmk2SG
Just off to see @jimmurphymp in Kirkintilloch at 12:30pm at the Regent Centre putting the positive case for @UK_Together #fb
@makesmilk I look forward to receiving it!
@katergraham @StylistMagazine Thanks lots
@simonwheale @vicderbyshire Thanks Simon
@alimehrkar there's lots of investment in skills in economy and still many people seeking work, depends on industry but many have addressed
@BermudaBat Cheers - we'll obv have to agree to disagree on the votes at 16 thing
@katergraham @StylistMagazine Thanks - looking forward to seeing it but not sure I'll find one in East Dunbartonshire!
@robmoss @teago_emplaw @Wonkypolicywonk @MJCarty indeed - great when employers do that and of course they become more attractive to work for
@ChrisBushnell1 yes paid at current rate of paternity pay
@Chessie_91 @pzj_1 sure - have had that from a few
@makesmilk happy to discuss - though suspect given issues email would allow greater ease of communication than 140 character chunks!
@stx @scotlibdems well NHS funding in England going up each year, but in any case it is Scot Govt who decide size of Scottish NHS budget
@makesmilk I'm a big fan of breastfeeding but still think parents should be able to choose how to share leave
@JumpMag drop me an email then with more info
@BermudaBat it's been our policy for many years - just fairer if you can marry, pay tax,  have kids etc should be able to vote
@Tricky77 eq issues are already there - this just increases people who could take leave - makes it harder to discriminate against them all
@goonerN7 @ScarletHarris given the cost in time and energy as well as money this will hardly incentivise it - just make it little less hard
@MarionArmer @LibDemPress actually helps parents to stay in labour market if more support for juggling their other commitments
@pzj_1 read my prev tweet - I will reply
@Wonkypolicywonk @teago_emplaw @MJCarty it's not necessarily either / or
@BelindaLester @Wonkypolicywonk @teago_emplaw @MJCarty true & it also doesn't need to all be taken at same time - some can be later in yr
@pzj_1 I do reply - automatic acknowledgement first then email reply asap, slightly longer than usual just now due to staff hols in summer
@jvcairns well you've got the pronoun right now but still tweeting nonsense
@paul5ter @bbc5live not a threat,  just a fact - not in rUK interest, nor actually in Scotland's interest given tight fiscal rules needed
@loganjimt1 @bbc5live @BBCScotlandNews IFS say indy Scotland would need to find an extra £6bn *on top* of current austerity programme
@ScouseTims hold your horses - just replied!
@ScouseTims @bbc5live rUK uses the pound and isn't liable to bail out Scottish banks in that scenario
@Wonkypolicywonk @teago_emplaw @MJCarty you'll have to see our pre-manifesto... raising income tax threshold is obv one such policy
@Wonkypolicywonk @teago_emplaw @MJCarty pay an issue for mothers & fathers alike re leave - agree wld be good if higher but need to find £
@ianjsilvera best to arrange any interviews with press office @Bispressoffice
@talking2someone cutting taxes for low earners, boosting state pension, more help on childcare costs, flexible working - all being delivered
@edcrick Thanks for compliment though I'm a liberal through and through
@paul5ter @bbc5live well not by threatening to default on debt!
@StevenAllanimag @natalie_coupar not asset in the balance sheet sense of the word
@ScouseTims @bbc5live if no CU and Scotland uses the pound then Scotland has no lender of last resort to back up savers' deposits and banks
@mc_iona @scotlibdems indeed!
@allylawson554 Cheers!
@jvcairns @bbc5live @BBCScotlandNews his? Pay attention...
@Wonkypolicywonk @teago_emplaw @MJCarty sure but 90% for women is to encourage time off post birth from *health* perspective for the mother
@vicariousgreen and CBC is working with these to make changes
@vicariousgreen agree, lots of industries have an impact - also fashion, beauty, retail
Looking forward to a lively debate on #indyref starting at 10am @bbc5live @bbcnews and BBC2 with @vicderbyshire  #fb
@DrGW0 @BBCr4today @VSOUK @GSTTnhs it's up to them - some employers do offer either paid or unpaid sabbaticals for staff
@Tricky77 by that rationale employers would favour older women workers as men can still have kids later in life
@mramlee @BBCr4today Thank you -  impressed (and surprised) by your apology - not common from those who are rude on Twitter!
@gavinj1999 @MellorSJ should I agree with everyone who tweets me? Equality is important & you were being dismissive of that
@chrisccoulson @melindiscott @BBCr4today appreciate families will make their own choices on range of factors including finance
@TerenceMcleod remember we're not forcing dads to take this: many people think dads' role with kids as important as mums' & shld have choice
@goonerN7 your assertion suggests gay people can't have kids - these policies apply to same-sex couple parents too
@ianjsilvera @SkyAnushka agree pay also an issue for maternity and paternity leave - though good to make what progress we can
@petewoodcock @SkyAnushka agree - 2 weeks is very short in terms of a newborn!
@Jammyhorse not saying there is no cost to taxpayer - but society needs to have a next generation well-supported
@clearmapping @Vicky_Wic @bisgovuk indeed
@Vicky_Wic exactly!  Also more men taking leave will act as catalyst for workplace change too
@fnf_bpm_cymru @LibDems Thanks
@stephentoon589 @LibDemPress why does it have to be mum?  Why not dad?
@RuthRobinsonLon @HuntDarton @pramhall @BBCRadio4 Thanks Ruth!
Good visit today to Bishopbriggs Seniors Forum: issues raised included #indyref, fracking, armed police and preserving Huntershill House #fb
Enjoyed discussing engaging young people in politics with @pamela_nash  and @jameswhartonmp as part of @skysubc campaign
@RobMatthews72 @BBCr4today no but they will benefit from younger generation working and able to support their pensions when they're retired
@profsarahchilds @BBCr4today Thanks Sarah - hope you're well
@DrGW0 @BBCr4today it's not holiday!  And hardly incentive to do so when stacked against responsibility for next 18+yrs
@johnbenner3 I'm sure some would say that, esp Labour supporters keen to win back the seat, but others would disagree, we'll find out in May
@jesschivers interesting link - agree use it or lose it is important but not keen on idea of cutting existing maternity entitlement
@Loafer7 @BBCr4today if Scotland votes yes Scotland will cease to have MPs at Westminster on date of indy - SNP have suggested March 2016
@philip_reed lots do take hols instead and appreciate pay also an issue - for maternity too,  as same rate
@goonerN7 @ScarletHarris we have recently extended right to request flex working to *all* employees not just parents
@ScarletHarris appreciate pay is also an issue, for maternity as well as paternity
@Tricky77 age discrimination illegal as is maternity discrimination - society does need to have next generation as does business
@Tricky77 they are compensated for paternity pay as for maternity pay
@melindiscott @BBCr4today nothing easy about having kids - but helping both parents be more involved is a good thing to do
@MrsWobbitt @BBCr4today I know from experience it is far from holiday - lovely but hard work!
@eurohumph @BBCr4today quite - that's why leave reserved for dads is important
@frydnes @BBCr4today Cheers Hilde
@mramlee @BBCr4today what a ray of sunshine you are!
@TerenceMcleod I'm a big fan of breastfeeding but that isn't threatened by dads taking paternity leave
@Les_Gilbert @LibDems so you are basically saying you think dads are more indispensable in the workplace than mums?
@StefKaday Thanks Stefan - I got the impression he wouldn't have been choosing to take 6 weeks paternity leave himself!
@AnnasQuestions Cheers Anna - I have some amusing folk on my twitter feed who are rather more stuck in a prev century
@DrGW0 @BBCr4today @VSOUK you do have right to request flexible working from your employer but govt support for new babies is different
@charlottekh @BBCr4today Thanks Charlotte!
@goonerN7 hardly a handout - looking after a newborn is no holiday
@gavinj1999 @MellorSJ @BBCr4today how tiresome, these women arguing for more equality for dads...
@MellorSJ @BBCr4today business (and society) would soon have problem if people stopped having kids - future customers & employees?
@dadbloguk Thanks!
@MellorSJ @BBCr4today I have 2 Ministerial portfolios - both in @bisgovuk  and as equalities minister
On my way to Pacific Quay to talk about shared parental leave and extending paternity leave on @BBCr4today #fb
@Wonkypolicywonk very interesting (and actually have mentioned the link) - think both policies make good contribution to narrowing pay gap
@PlanBPartners @EastDunVA best to send an email and we'll see if we can arrange something
@Wonkypolicywonk indeed reasons for pay gap are varied as you say, so we need to have a variety of tools to address it

Final day of my summer tour - today I'm around and about across Kirkintilloch and Lenzie http://t.co/ElsSvGB6pX #fb
@nil_by_mooth complex issue & happy to be enquiring about it on behalf of constituents but not well suited to 140 chars, will reply asap
@Dungarbhan @scotlibdems only 3 surgeries on the tour - I do them all year round, this is much more intensive!
@YouRockScience Thanks - just managing to squeeze in a cuppa now before public meeting this eve!
@nil_by_mooth apologies it's a bit longer than usual due to the summer hols and staff taking well-deserved annual leave
Day 4 of summer tour complete! http://t.co/ElsSvGB6pX - feel free to come to my public meeting tonight on #indyref at 7pm in Lenzie Hall #fb
Pleased to see @CIPR_UK doing more to support women on maternity leave and helping them return to work: http://t.co/nFBjA2qBgJ

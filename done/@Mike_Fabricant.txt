.@Dayvdee @GuidoFawkes Labour MPs had no choice. It was a three line whip for them. It was a free vote for Cons and Lib-Dems.  47-53% split. Fri Mar 27 08:11:53 GMT 2015
.@NickMillward #Lichfield IS very pretty. We are north east of Birmingham in the countryside of Staffordshire. Fri Mar 27 08:09:30 GMT 2015
@mrchrisjohn I think the French prosecutor takes the view that it was deliberate because the cockpit door had been locked from the inside. Fri Mar 27 08:07:50 GMT 2015

#Bercow saved by Labour Whips. (Cons on a free vote). Possibly now the most Party-Political and divisive Speaker ever in @HouseofCommons? Thu Mar 26 14:23:41 GMT 2015
I have left the Chamber.  Some of the self righteous rubbish being spouted has disgusted me.
Why oppose "secret ballots" for heaven's sake? Thu Mar 26 12:59:14 GMT 2015
.@StuartLong01 @paulwaugh @jreedmp No. It is not for me to question any Speaker on his rulings in the Chamber.

Interesting tactic. 3 urgent questions chosen by Speaker today which will delay vote on secret ballot for a sitting Speaker. Thu Mar 26 10:17:43 GMT 2015

MPs and selection of Speaker are both elected in a secret ballot. Only the reappointment of a sitting Speaker is an open vote. #undemocratic Thu Mar 26 08:49:26 GMT 2015

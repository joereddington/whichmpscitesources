Interesting that @BBCNormanS believes that UKIP victory #RochesterandStrood does not herald a breakthrough but merely a by-election protest.
.@WooTube  You are saying flying the English flag is racist?  I think NOT. They fly it @LichfieldCath on St George's Day!
I am about to go on LBC to talk about Twitter and by-elections.  (That'll make Conservative HQ and No10 panic!!)
.@GrahamSayer2 Oh!
I DO like that.
The Lib-Dems finished with under 1% and trailed the Greens. They got just 349 votes, the lowest in their history....  #RochesterandStrood
The Lib-Dems in particular, &Labour too, should be worried by the #RochesterandStrood result. Lab should be doing better if EdM is to be PM
I went to bed at 1 and woke up to a UKIP win surprise surprise. BUT the majority was NOT as large as I (or UKIP) expected.

I will be mentioned tonight - in my absence (banned by #Speaker) - for my work on #EqualBlood.

And the @Telegraph covers my #EqualBlood debate too!
  
http://t.co/7Y0HNaSA79
Today, my 10 min rule bill looks at the whether gay men should be able to donate blood. Retweet if you agree and favourite if you don’t.
“@ascentofmoney: @Mike_Fabricant @derekhardy1958 @guardian You should join #UKIP even though your a looney” < I'd be right at home then! Lol
Alternative view: “@costofcameron: A referendum shouldn't even be offered. Dangerous to jobs/business if immigration obsessed ppl vote out.”

"@uxbridgewalrus: Great speech on Hs2 compensation by the indomitable @CherylGillanMP" < He's sitting behind me!
The minister answers my question on the need for generous compensation not only for Phase 1 but Phase 2 of #HS2 as well.
I believe I am the only MP so far to sit in on the #HS2 Committee. They seem very thorough and independent of #HS2 Limited so far.
In Chamber of @HouseofCommons with Cheryl Gillan as she explains the need for better compensation for #HS2 blight. Many entitled to none.

.@JamesWillby @Damage_13 @pgpchappers Goods for Far East and elsewhere are mainly consolidated in Rotterdam etc. But counted as EU exports.
.@JamesWillby @Damage_13 @pgpchappers EU figures are WRONG. When UK goods are shipped to EU for immediate re-export out, they count as EU.
.@pgpchappers @JamesWillby I'm not suggesting that. We trade with BRICS and the Far East as well as the US and Canada.
@AndCounting321 Squawk squawk
.@JamesWillby @pgpchappers Suggest you read some US Treasury reports about the EU and the UK membership of EU. 1 report 400+ pages long.
.@Andym6769 And although we have that link with Europe, we have long traded more with countries outside the EU.
.@Andym6769 And France too! Soon their debt will be 100% of GDP instead of the 60% maximum determined by the European Central Bank.
.@pgpchappers EU is NOT an "economic powerhouse". It is in decline compared to other groups. UK is a major economy & on security council etc
.@colcoops Precisely the point I am making. That is why #Timing is all important.
"@pgpchappers why are you so keen to leave the EU?" < Because I no longer believe it is in our economic interests to remain in.
"@Andym6769 We shouldn't worry about them we need to look after our own intrests"<  I agree though our economy is linked with rest of Europe
.@Andym6769 Because he who pays the piper plays the tune. If UK leaves EU, their budget is stuffed. We are 2nd largest net contributor.
.2/2 The Scottish Referendum showed that with a barrage from businesses & others predicting disaster, people vote for no change. #Timing
Barroso today illustrates that an early EU In/Out Referendum would not give us the result I would want. OUT. Timing is important. 1/2

.@SaileshPyPatel I think MPs should dress formally in the Chamber and Committees of the House of Commons when legislating, but not elsewhere

"@JM_Wentworth: @Mike_Fabricant Is that the Commonwealth flag on the left?" < Well spotted, sir. It is. Unlike EU, with a growing economy!

“@StuEkins: @ChrisBryantMP ha! OK. So it could be more force of habit/cheek than him feeling lonely and ineffective already.” < Maybe.
.@Chris_Wood_1989 Nothing wrong with that. But to make a splash for his Party, he could have asked a more politically penetrating question.
On the subject of friends, I have co-sponsors from Labour, Lib-Dem, Plaid Cymru, as well as Conservative for my #EqualBlood Bill next week.
.@StuEkins But generally, "friend" is reserved for someone on the same side of the Chamber. I find it restrictive.
.@StuEkins I used to refer to @ChrisBryantMP as my "friend" in Chamber when we were on same committee (tho he didn't like it). No law abt it

@bradtapper13 @hezzeh3 no it has not been. Sentences left out. Until you hear the Intv dint make judgement on basis of RAheem.
@Penina18 @MailOnline @IDFSpokesperson  no I am not.  Only individual with agenda deliberately misleading.
@bradtapper13 @hezzeh3  statemennotfully transcribed. There are sentences missing. It's deliberate lies and mischief.
@bradtapper13 @hezzeh3  I never did. Go and actually listen to what I said in its entirety
@SamirDwesar but it's not correct. He has taken out many sentences deliberately. What he has put is not full Intv.
@SamirDwesar I never said that.  Listen to entire interview. You  will realise that He is a liar
Women, girls and boys yes boys irrespective of race are victims of sex abuse. Depends which part of country you go to and where they are
1/2 argued for years that emphasis should be on making children aware of dangers and the allegations should be investigated urgently
1/1 Victims of sexual abuse and perpetrators are found everywhere. The  modus operandi depends on where victims and perpetrators are based
Use to prosecute sexual abuse of Children cases. Common factor vulnerable victims and perverted  men
@sunny_hundal   amazing when saville , smith' etal raped etc children in care homes etc  no one brought their race etc in to question.
@bradtapper13 @hezzeh3 that's not what I said. See my tweet
For avoidance of doubt Isis is evil. Not Islamic in any way form or shape.
@hezzeh3  but there are people who say whether you kill with sword, gun, bombs full of nails, phosphate  etc you are killing.
@hezzeh3   Muslim not joining army in large nos = lack of loyalty. Brit Jews joining  idf  no one questions thier loyalty. That was my point

@DrEoinCl  that is  why ukip done so well. They exploited lies of sun, express, daily mail telegraph. Ukip thrived on scaremongering
@NuvoPolitico @DrEoinCl  that is so funny
@mirtaimperatori  yes you are right in that he was leader. It was bad judgement on his part to have joined Tories.

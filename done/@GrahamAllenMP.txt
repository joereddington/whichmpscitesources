The lesson of the lost NEast referendum 2001 is strike while you have the momentum if you want Devolution. Delay if you don't want it.
UK devolution is a Federal Parl matter eg giving entrenched independence to local gov in England, so it can't be undone by an English Parl

If you can't bring yourself to be clear on English devolution at this historic moment, when would you?
Lack of leadership on English devolution will result in a spate of"every Council for itself"deals with Whitehall.
Failure to be clear on our offer on English devolution means the debate continues  to be about Westminster MPs not empowering the localities

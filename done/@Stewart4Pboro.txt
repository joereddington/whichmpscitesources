@LisaForbes_ I resigned on principle to fight for a referendum whilst you take orders from your union paymasters: yes our standards differ. Mon Feb 02 23:16:21 GMT 2015
@LisaForbes_ I asked you a straightforward question. Have you bargained a future vote on EU referendum for £10k? Voters will be keen to know Mon Feb 02 23:08:21 GMT 2015
@adam_lewkowicz Yes I won that case. Do keep up. Mon Feb 02 22:43:25 GMT 2015
@LisaForbes_ Lisa: Can you confirm the £10k donation you accepted from Lord Oakshott wasn't based on agreeing to vote against EU referendum? Mon Feb 02 22:04:01 GMT 2015

Finally got around to reading @Andrew_Adonis book on coalition talks in 2010. Thoughtful, fascinating & well worth a read
V interesting piece on Tyne & Wear bus network and Quality Contract consultation: http://t.co/7yYyU2GaEb
@XeNeX101 agree - I voted against

@ShooFlyPub will give you an #ff mention on Friday. Hope you is well with the team
@LucyRigby what a lovely photo
@andybanjobrown I guessed from hashtag. If your mum wants to get in touch she can write or ring, but I've been keeping residents updated
@andybanjobrown parking problems came up again & again when door knocking there so took up - but Cllr Gemma Taylor involved too
@mrs_creynolds you're absolutely right. Women should be supported to breastfeed whenever their baby needs to.
@MonsoonKitchen well do fill in survey! If you want to send more info on Ramadan pledge, just email. Julie is your MP, but I'm interested
I'm asking local people their views on nuisance calls. If you want to share your experiences, here's my survey: https://t.co/RuA9xqwIcE
@davo882000 I've replied to your email
@LouiseMensch but concerning that state pupil applying to Russell Gp needs 1 grade higher vs private w/same subjects: http://t.co/P0lFtlTTOL
@DRLT well done!
@DuncanWeldon neither did I, but now we have tickets. Will report back
@DuncanWeldon In the Night Garden Live might be something to consider as she gets bigger..
@DuncanWeldon it's all a bit strange and repetitious but the little one loves it. The books also v helpful on train journeys
@Matthew_F93 you can check if I am your MP here: http://t.co/S6A0532Rxh If so, please drop me an email and I can take up for you. Thanks
Situation been getting worse for many residents who want action & hope this will bring about improvement: http://t.co/Wrt7WfUSmR
@laurenlaverne or Houghton le Spring. I've given up correcting people.
@hopisen thanks Hopi. I usually add that whatever the challenges life is far tougher for many others. Hope all is well with you.
@gabyhinsliff women often in no win situation. I try to be realistic but not unduly negative. Too many women already don't go for it
@dj_kyushu thanks Bruce - keep in touch
@gabyhinsliff that's right - you worry but it all works out & at times hard to remember life before
@ACunninghamMP congratulations Alex - and to the whole family. Lovely news.
@Danny_Saxby one day in Tyne & Wear, I hope...
@addielambert I certainly do, yes
@Danny_Saxby quite possibly; we don't
Congratulations to our European candidates @Jude_KD @PaulBrannenNE and @jshttn - look forward to campaigning with you all in months ahead
@dentpetersimon thanks - and you. Appreciate your support.
@_peoples_party take a look at http://t.co/YH8jG2XcE6 - about regulation, fares, local people having a say and yes better info too
@_peoples_party a decent local bus service supporting economy to grow is a key priority
What an improvement real time information would be on local buses. Nothing for half hour &no way of knowing what's going on #bigbuscampaign
@Jude_KD congratulations Jude! Look forward to campaigning with you in Sunderland
@davedinho do you want to drop me an email and I'll send you a full response? It's http://t.co/e8z8KPOWRU(at)parliament.uk
@AnnelieseDodds well done Anneliese! I'm so pleased for you & you'll be brilliant. Hope the little one is doing well too
Well worth a visit to @SundMuseum to see Grayson Perry tapestries. Loved 'The Agony in the Car Park' http://t.co/0uYuyPYrnz
Need answers from govt on Sunderland courts. Met Chairman of Bench this afternoon - magistrates keen to see progress: http://t.co/1ugNs7iibe
@89Hannah89 good luck Hannah. What are you off to do?
@Nwestmarland glad to hear it - will do. Never been there before
@antoniabance thanks Antonia. Hope all is well
@duddy66 thanks Alan
@MissMandoline merci!
@Nwestmarland thanks Nicole. I hope you're well
@NorthumbriaPCC thanks Vera
@kellymckitt agree & have given comments to local press. Ignorant, ill informed and just plain wrong. When was the last time he came to NE?
@torydom I've been clear that this is about better value for taxpayer. Some of profits generated will be used, rather than leaving region
It's a privilege to be unanimously reselected by local members & affiliates as Lab candidate for 2015 general election. Grateful for support
@torydom it's not nationalisation. 81% would pay less or same on day one. Fare rises capped to inflation unlike at present
Stagecoach can always be relied upon, especially their blinkered view that local people are happy with bus service: http://t.co/EOW9U3IscH
@luchealer oh go on then..
@LargoJuanPlata I will see you then! Do join us for campaigning if you're free. You should get my emails where details are included
@ftmsuperfly sorry to hear about your difficulties - will ask my office to get in touch.
@LargoJuanPlata glad to hear you've got involved since joining the party. Hope to meet you soon
@ftmsuperfly not sure of your name/details but if you want to chase this, then drop me an email or ring my constituency office. Thanks
An important step forward for my campaign for better buses. Public consultation agreed on Quality Contract scheme: http://t.co/FKdZz86oO8
@mariemarie0 I'll have to pop in. Hope all is well with you. Be lovely to catch up at some point
@StuartForster thanks - will be in touch
@mariemarie0 brilliant - thanks for tip
Decision this week on bus network in Tyne & Wear and opportunity for real change: http://t.co/CWoWLC0Kqw
@Matthew_F93 I'm happy to send you full response but it'd be better if you could send me an email - http://t.co/e8z8KPOWRU(at)parliament.uk
Good morning door knocking around Fencehouses and Mulberry Park with Cllr Gemma Taylor and others. But where has sunshine gone?
@Autism_in_Mind thanks Carole. Good to see you all.
@FrankiCookney enjoyed it but thought there would be more to it. Ending disappointing
@IndyPolitics by election?
Long term unemployment figures for Houghton & Sunderland S alarming. Those out of work for more than 2 years increased by 470% in last year
@PMCallaghan done. Hope all is well
Glorious sunshine at Durham Miners' Gala. Couldn't ask for better day. Great to see Silksworth banner group http://t.co/CsQRlXUdDE
Thanks to 45+ people who came to my coffee morning in Silksworth on anti-social behaviour. Lots to take up http://t.co/jeN2rkjo4E
@JonAshworth congrats Jon
@dj_kyushu thanks for tweet
@shooker72 @torydom was setting out the facts for clarity. Of course any decision about MPs pay must bear in mind economic situation&impact
@DRLT enjoy!
@torydom In recent years MPs pay has been frozen. This is a proposal out to public consultation & rightly so
@DRLT London always feels worse being so built up & you can escape to coast easily in NE
Can't quite believe that NE will be hottest part of country tomorrow. Hope it stays that way for Miners Gala on Saturday
@DJSkelton I thought I had misheard - glad to have it confirmed
@torydom I don't imagine we will agree on these things!
@thom_brooks not there yet (we don't vote today) but hopeful we will make progress. Hope you're well
@Transplant2013 thanks
I'm supporting #NationalTransplantWeek & encouraging others to join Organ Donor Register too: http://t.co/Q2gDQ6H5cp @Transplant2013
Also pressed my amendment on Forced Marriage. Criminalisation alone won't be enough to identify&support victims. Dept for Educ must do more
Moved my amendment to Anti-social Behaviour Bill for stronger background checks on domestic violence before firearms licences granted
@SambucaOfficial well done, richly deserved I'm sure
@delshej pretty much - Seaburn/Whitburn
@MonsoonKitchen I did pass you today & I will be in at some point. Hope business going well
Another from earlier. It felt like the Mediterranean #summeratlast http://t.co/bBOJ7YUGo2
Perfect day - view from @latimersseafood http://t.co/CdgnUMBL42
Houghton & Sunderland South Labour holding a summer fayre from 11 today at Hetton Centre. Stalls, cakes & more. Def picked right day for it
Finished day out in sunshine delivering letters about my coffee morning in Silksworth next Friday. More info here: https://t.co/CrzgQW1PMB
@Daoudmsund I think rule is that you can claim for a meal if House sits after 7.30pm, but I choose not to so not 100% on rule
@Daoudmsund I don't recognise that figure -think it predates 2010 expenses system. All rules published on IPSA website if you want to look..
@dj_kyushu thanks - will be in touch. Attended lobby - was a packed meeting and met local rep
@dj_kyushu drop me an email and will send full response - http://t.co/e8z8KPOWRU(at)parliament.uk. I'm hoping to attend CWU lobby this PM
@ftmsuperfly thanks - will be in touch
We're holding a summer fayre at the Hetton Centre from 11-1.30 this Saturday. Come along for cakes, kids' face painting, stalls & much more

@LewisAtkinson congratulations! Can't wait to meet her. Love to you all, especially Leila
Sunny afternoon out in Redcar with Labour's PPC @AnnaTurley & big team. Fish & chips on seafront too http://t.co/JzUHZU21Uf
On #armedforcesday it's an opportunity to pay tribute to our servicemen and women past and present & their families
Local #ff to Sunderland Carers Centre @sunderlandcarer who do fantastic work & @SundMuseum where Grayson Perry exhibition opens today
More of the same from Chancellor. Failure on living standards&growth. Surprised he had brass neck to repeat we're all in it together #SR2013
I'm hosting coffee morning on 12th July with @NorthumbriaPol on crime& ASB but also chance to chat informally. RSVP: https://t.co/CrzgQW1PMB

A privilege to be elected as a Vice Chair of National Policy Forum as we work towards our manifesto for 2015 #NPF
En route to Labour's National Policy Forum in Birmingham http://t.co/ecvz1x5nbP #NPF
I'll be on Around the House tonight with @HelenFordITV discussing Police and Crime Commissioners. Clip here: http://t.co/Slqu9cju5M

After 11, I'm on Sunday Politics in NE with @BBCRichardMoss talking about NHS, north east unemployment figures & UKIP
@Daoudmsund that's very kind of you - thanks
@Natasha_Walter thank you for giving evidence. It was compelling & very clear about where changes can be made
@WendyNewton2 could you send me an email and will take up for you? Thanks. It's http://t.co/e8z8KPOWRU(at)parliament.uk
@Hifistud could you send me that by email so that I can do so when I'm sat at computer? Thanks.
Report today from @CommonsHomeAffs on child sexual exploitation. I raised today in Home Office questions: http://t.co/g09xnWaxQt
@Hifistud ha! Thanks.
@Hifistud at some point, we rotate around the area
Glorious sunny day to be out door knocking around Philadelphia #labourdoorstep http://t.co/iS4TWz8Jto
@ChrisWimpress ministers have started referring constituents' letters there so I'm not so sure
@carrdr we did much in govt on this, but Labour's childcare commission examining in detail & will bring forward proposals
@BFG316 a very large number of constituents contacted me about their concerns on this
Glad that government backed down on childcare ratios. Flawed from the start and opposed by parents, staff & experts: http://t.co/K0e1b1xjcR
In debate being led by @AndyMcDonaldMP on future of East Coast mainline. Had a PMQ earlier on NHS- there has been much concern locally
@AnnelieseDodds congratulations! Love to the three of you
@TheLakePoets One Day by David Nicholls. But avoid the film.
@1DaveyMo afraid so. My powers are a bit limited in that regard.
@DRLT hope everything goes well for you. Do you have a job lined up?
@1DaveyMo clearly it was to no avail as been raining all morning
Door knocking in towers at Lakeside. Lots of concern about bedroom tax. Also parking probs&councillors trying to sort http://t.co/z2R1oYpLM2
@Linford_44 glad to be of help. It's now got worse.
Can it really be June? Seeking refuge from the rain at the tea rooms before meeting Wearside Friends of the Earth http://t.co/H0fXYBoP3Y

@4refugeewomen great to meet campaigners Ghada and Rahema & will no doubt be hearing more when Home Affairs Cttee asylum inquiry underway
@weirdo67 can understand you disagree but I feel strongly it's right
Proud to have voted for #equalmarriage this evening & that legislation a step closer
Good to see business leaders making economic case for EU. Thousands of jobs in NE depend on access to single market:  http://t.co/EtNrKqAzaT
@vickyfoxcroft many congratulations on your selection
Horrific details in The Times about abuse in Oxford. Very brave young women, but makes me so angry they were disbelieved for so long
Update in @TheNorthernEcho on government school rebuilding programme and Hetton School:  http://t.co/Qn52qWz54o
@purvis_craig thanks Craig. A step closer for NE schools but still uncertainty
@NHConsortium will try my best. Thanks for reminder.
Hope we do see u-turn on childcare ratios. Parents, staff and experts oppose. Changes would damage quality of care http://t.co/9a9sT1HAko
Big welcome from Labour colleagues for new Shields MP @EmmaLewellBuck on her arrival in Parliament http://t.co/TVGKZTrYiR

‘65,900 city families hit by Osborne tax changes’ - Evening Times | News http://t.co/XEi8NFmj
In the Autumn Statement Osborne taking £41M away from almost 400K Scottish Children; 44K in Glasgow losing 4.8M alone. Its truly disgraceful
Does presenting Top Gear really count as work? Teachers, nurses and many public sectors workers actually work for a living, he just pretends
Then we can see if he still thinks they are "gold plated". What a fool Clarkson really is!
Jeremy Clarkson's idiotic statements are a disgrace and an insult. He should be pensioned off by the BBC on a average public sector pension!
The more I hear and more I read about St Andrews Tories burning an effigy of Obama the more I wish David Cameron would speak out against it!
I am very sad to hear the terrible news of Alan Keen's death. He was a lovely man and my sympathies and thoughts are with Ann his wife.

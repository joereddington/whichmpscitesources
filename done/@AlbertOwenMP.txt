Government has a role to play in promoting higher wages through real devolution of jobs to areas like Anglesey.
People want to contribute to their community and society - a living wage will help people to do this.
As a former manager of a centre for the unemployed I have seen the impact of low wages on families

@theNukeGuy Has to be a mix of nuclear, renewables , clean coal & gas and energy efficiency to meet our demands and a low carbon economy.
Honest @George_Osborne put up taxes and broke Tory promise on VAT and failed to eliminate the deficit.Can't belive a word he says.
UKIP policy on Tax/VAT unraveling- @David_Cameron afraid to mention VAT after his tax hike & broken promise. Reality Right Wing =High taxes

Hear Michael Gove is new Tory Chief Whip a colleagues suggested he will probably set up Free Whipping Academies.
Seems Stephen Crabb is next Welsh Secretary- about the only predictable appointment in reshuffle. I wish him well but feel for David Jones
The reshuffle of UK Government is dominating the political agenda. A few surprises no doubt, but @David_Cameron & @nick_clegg still at helm.
Catching up with 'news'-scanning Sunday Papers. Agree with @johnprescott that Alan Johnson MP would be an excellent addition to Labour team.
A great goal for the best team and deserving winners of the World Cup. Well done Germany. I did predict a European win
Extra Time -I have really enjoyed this World Cup but I hope ithe Final doesn't go to penalties-bring back Golden Goal.
Good atmosphere at the Penucheldre open day. Thanks to Gordon Druce for invite and staff and community for the welcome
A cool fresh start to the day here on Anglesey. Hope the weather holds for local community events today.

On train home from London and it has been good to talk to constituents about a wide range of issues. Sunshine all the way up so far.

Full casework day was nicely broken meeting visitors to @UKParliament including @jimferno who is off to see The Queen tomorrow-well done.
Francis Maude & Tory MPs enjoying attacking British workers and their unions who have withdrawn their labour in the @HouseofCommons today
My IT systems are getting back to normal and apologies for delays in email contact with constituents and others.
Interesting day in Parliament today included chairing Legislation Committee on Adoption and raised questions at both Welsh & PM questions
Challenged PM to acknowledge success of Jobs Growth Wales and to stop attacking Wales. He refused to do so. http://t.co/S4UtxeoExH
Improved transport links can boost Anglesey’s economy http://t.co/FDPU0dEQVi
A week in Westminster http://t.co/snSSXAlam9
Great weekend of sport but Monday morning casework hampered by IT problems. No email access- should be sorted later today.
Great atmosphere on the streets ahead of the start of Tour de France. Flags including Ddraig Goch in gardens and windows of route.
Showers is not dampening the spirits of the crowds  gathering for stage 2 of Tour de France in York #thegranddepart
Heading to Yorkshire for next stage of Tour de France, a great success for the county and for British cycling.
A short walk in great Anglesey weather is so refreshing #islandofchoice #dewismon
Full Constituency Friday in the Anglesey rain included site visits, meeting parents concerned over council's school plans & advice surgeries
Great to meet @Y_S_T_J in Parliament and tour the Speaker's Apartment. Excellent group.
Pleser mawr oedd cwrdd a disgyblion @Y_S_T_J yn San Steffan a'u tywys o gwmpas cartref syddogol y Llefarydd. Grwp Gwyrch.

In Labour led debate on cross border rail issues. Made case for greater connection between Holyhead/ North Wales and rest of UK network
Looking forward to a full day in @UKParliament including debates,campiagns and a visit by YSTJ Amlwch.
Reply from CEO of UK Powers Networks that customer satisfaction is very high, but admits no one knows who they are or how much they charge.
Asked DNOs what role network costs played in rising consumer energy bills. Answer-considerable, but costs done in future. Heard that before.
Off to Energy Select Committee to begin inquiry on Network costs. This is a vital component of our bills and needs real scruitiny
No better start to the day than a walk along 'rocky coast' near North Stack. Anglesey  
#islandofchoice #dewismon.
Good news-The @UKParliament Justice Committee is to hold an inquiry into Manorial Rights-something I have called for as part of my campaign

@adamjones416 not just the 'working man' but for all -the many not the few. Remember polls in Wales-Lab on 40%-PC the 4th party on just 12% Mon Apr 27 08:32:26 BST 2015
@adamjones416 @HywelPlaidCymru that's what independent analysis inc. IFS say examining spending plans as opposed to Plaid/Green propaganda. Mon Apr 27 07:58:21 BST 2015
Tories to focus on economy. Great- focus on failure to clear deficit, Loss of AAA status &broken promises on Tax hikes inc.VAT-hurting SMEs Mon Apr 27 07:54:52 BST 2015
@ianjamesjohnson Ian it's not spin it's called independent scrutiny & it's clear the anti austerity rhetoric is just that- rhetoric Mon Apr 27 07:50:36 BST 2015
@ianjamesjohnson 'rhetoric and their [SNP] stated plans for total spending which imply bigger [deeper]cuts to spending by '19-20 than Labour Mon Apr 27 07:48:28 BST 2015
@ianjamesjohnson No Ian independent analysis I too have read the report on p39 IFS on SNP 'there is considerable disconnect between this.1/2 Mon Apr 27 07:44:38 BST 2015

@ianjamesjohnsonNo the Independent news IFS found 'a considerable disconnect' between SNP rhetoric & plans. Anti-austerity=longer austerity. Fri Apr 24 17:37:19 BST 2015

Last farewell to Merion (Cae Mawr) a great local Llaingoch character. Dyn annwyl iawn. Fri Apr 24 12:30:06 BST 2015
@ianjamesjohnson No that's the SNP according to the IFS who are clear SNP (your alliance partners) would impose deeper & longer cuts. Fri Apr 24 12:26:27 BST 2015
@akzt @HywelPlaidCymru Not for the whole Parliament when tax increases etc are taken into account that's an issue for our costed manifesto Fri Apr 24 12:19:50 BST 2015
@HywelPlaidCymru Understand this is a setback PC/Green/SNP alliance & their false claims. IFS clear their anti-austerity is just rhetoric. Fri Apr 24 11:44:54 BST 2015
@HywelPlaidCymru Nice try-independent IFS a respected body has looked at figures NOW & say £1bn cuts. Fact-SNP alliance = longer austerity. Fri Apr 24 09:28:07 BST 2015
Plaid Cymru's myth on Labour cuts blown out of the water by respected independent IFS analysis & SNP led 'alliance' creates longer austerity Fri Apr 24 08:31:18 BST 2015
Independent IFS shows the SNP (Green Plaid Alliance) anti austerity mesures don't stack up-even extends austerity. 1 Choice Tory or Labour Fri Apr 24 07:08:18 BST 2015
Independent IFS shows SNP deliveris longer austerity-major differences between Labour & Tories & destroys Plaid Cymru myths about Lab. cuts. Fri Apr 24 07:02:34 BST 2015

@gerallttml @OfficeGSBrown Thanks Gerallt, we will not agree- but it is a fact that George Osborne said he would clear the deficit by 2015 Mon Apr 13 17:16:40 BST 2015
@gerallttml There was a global recession &Tories still failed & wanted less regulation. Sadly the poorest have paid over the last 5 years. Mon Apr 13 16:44:03 BST 2015
Tories on the defensive over the deficit. Remember they made a cast iron guarantee to eliminate it in the last Parliament. #brokenpromises Mon Apr 13 12:53:58 BST 2015

Good news coverage on Wylfa Nweydd. I welcome it as does Labour Leadership. Heard Plaid leader on Angkesy-not a peek she opposes nuclear. Tue Apr 07 22:36:19 BST 2015
@UndebPlaidCymru Last reply. The reality is -Tories are more likely to win if major opposition Party lose seats to other parties. fact Tue Apr 07 21:51:09 BST 2015
Good day in brilliant Anglesey sunshine.  Work and campaigning done but failed to get into the garden. Nomination papers delivered. Tue Apr 07 21:23:30 BST 2015
@UndebPlaidCymru. that's just the Nat/Green view. It defies logic. If the main opposition party lose the incumbent benefit. Simple fact. Tue Apr 07 20:54:25 BST 2015
@UndebPlaidCymru @Alun_Pugh @welshlabour We can agree on this. Basic maths tells us that if Labour loose seats it assists incumbent Tories Tue Apr 07 16:34:34 BST 2015

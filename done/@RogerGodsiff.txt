For every £1 spent on promoting healthy eating by government over £100 is spent promoting bad diets by industry. From @CitizensUK manifesto Mon Apr 27 12:36:18 BST 2015
I support the @teachersupport manifesto. Teachers do vital work and work very long hours. They need better support  #health4edu Mon Apr 27 11:10:10 BST 2015
Govt departments such as @HMRCgovuk should NOT be using nasty, unprofessional bailiff agencies to claw back tax credit overpayments. Fri Apr 24 13:50:36 BST 2015
Why is @HMRCgovuk paying aggressive bailiff firms to collect working tax credit overpayment instead of gradual payment from future benefits? Fri Apr 24 13:48:09 BST 2015
It seems that @HMRCgovuk are now outsourcing clawing back tax credit overpayments to very unpleasant agencies that use aggressive bailiffs. Fri Apr 24 13:46:45 BST 2015
The @NationalGallery should pay all staff living wage & keep contracts in-house to avoid race to the bottom on wages & working conditions. Wed Apr 22 12:01:51 BST 2015
There is, quite rightly, massive public grief & shock when a passenger plane crashes. Where is our sympathy for drowned desperate refugees? Wed Apr 22 11:07:38 BST 2015
As @AmnestyUK points out, more than 1,000 refugees drowned crossing Mediterranean last week - equivalent to 5 passenger planes full. Wed Apr 22 11:05:55 BST 2015
A decent society leaves no human being to starve or drown. Our current treatment of refugees and the poor is inhumane and unacceptable. Wed Apr 22 10:05:21 BST 2015
44% of food bank referrals were due to problems with benefits. People looking for work or too ill to work have a right to state support. Wed Apr 22 09:53:38 BST 2015
More than 1 million people used food bank last year. No one should have to rely on food aid. We need living wage and strong safety net. Wed Apr 22 09:52:04 BST 2015
We must not leave people fleeing war and terror to drown. UK has duty of care towards refugees yet has accepted fewer than 200 Syrians. Mon Apr 20 11:10:01 BST 2015
Today is last day to register to vote. You may need to re-register even if you previously voted at same address. https://t.co/ALcXY6AQuk Mon Apr 20 10:49:19 BST 2015
If elected as MP, I would help build stable funding foundations for women’s  refuges. #HearMe #VoteFeminist Fri Apr 17 10:36:05 BST 2015

Petition for investigation into tragic deaths of three young men in Brum as they tried to defend city from rioters http://t.co/fXGgI4zuN6 Wed Apr 15 15:36:21 BST 2015
UK Govt spends 25 times more on weapons research than on renewable energy. This is not a recipe for safe, prosperous world @CAATuk Wed Apr 15 14:57:16 BST 2015
Living wage is way out of poverty. Tax cuts will not benefit workers on minimum wage, just damage essential public services they rely on. Wed Apr 15 14:34:08 BST 2015
Labour Govt would extend Freedom of Information law to privatised public service contracts. Public needs to know real cost of privatisation. Wed Apr 15 14:26:18 BST 2015
I support campaign to reduce number of long term empty homes. Houses should be lived in, not left empty as "investments"  #nomoreemptyhomes Wed Apr 15 13:09:04 BST 2015
Since 2012, Government sold off 26,000 council houses and built only 2,298. We need to build more affordable homes, not sell them off. Wed Apr 15 11:47:31 BST 2015
Keep arms companies out of BBC! BAE Systems Chair to be paid 70k by BBC despite record of arming dictators http://t.co/stGsuLV6Il @CAATuk Thu Apr 02 18:26:29 BST 2015
Rich people who get even richer if corporation tax is lowered object to increasing it. Hardly a revelation... Wed Apr 01 10:58:04 BST 2015
@Topshop's refusal to pay contracted cleaners London Living Wage is disgraceful. I support @United__Voices members fighting for their rights Thu Mar 26 17:22:44 GMT 2015
@Topshop makes millions in profit, but only pays its London contracted cleaners a miserly £6.50 per hour, too little to live on in London. Thu Mar 26 17:21:21 GMT 2015
If someone takes millions of public money, the public have a right to know what they are lobbying elected Govt on #princecharlesletters Thu Mar 26 11:20:24 GMT 2015
Supreme Court vote to release #PrinceCharles lobbying letters is triumph for democracy & accountability. Cameron & Clegg opposed of course Thu Mar 26 11:18:17 GMT 2015
Tax rates from @38_degrees Why do we allow a private equity executive to pay tax at 12.7% while nurse pays 20%? http://t.co/Whj4ScVSHg Wed Mar 25 17:20:41 GMT 2015
Five ways the government is failing NHS patients - ToUChstone blog http://t.co/VEdqhfZYOa via @TouchstoneBlog Fri Mar 20 12:07:42 GMT 2015
Govt's full stats on PIP processing times are here http://t.co/s0JLvbEGEZ Fri Mar 20 11:42:20 GMT 2015
Govt finally releases stats on waiting times for PIP claims. Median waiting time 20 weeks. Five months with no income is a very long time. Fri Mar 20 11:42:06 GMT 2015
Lots of constituents writing in to support fully public NHS and no TTIP. Not a single voice in favour of NHS privatisation! I entirely agree Wed Mar 18 13:17:30 GMT 2015
Is there any track record of incompetence, failure and injury to patients that would prevent private health companies getting NHS contracts? Mon Mar 16 12:26:30 GMT 2015
Why are Tories still giving companies with awful track records taxpayers' money to provide NHS healthcare? Outrageous http://t.co/eZZpThfIS9 Mon Mar 16 11:55:10 GMT 2015
83% of lights in Syria gone out since conflict began. World leaders must do more to help civilians https://t.co/rwLFkdfJOw via @amnestyuk Mon Mar 16 10:53:12 GMT 2015
Call for political action to Saudi Arabia to free Raif Badawi and Waleed Abu Al-Khair http://t.co/N1aLYSBcBE via @wordpressdotcom Mon Mar 09 14:39:33 GMT 2015
Congratulations to Bangladesh's cricket team on their superb victory! Mon Mar 09 12:54:25 GMT 2015
Between 2007-13, cash benefits paid to richest fifth of population increased by 42%. For poorest fifth, benefits fell by 5% @InequalityBrief Mon Mar 09 10:31:44 GMT 2015
I’ve joined @letskeepitcoop because it’s important @thecooperative stays true to its values & has a political voice. Thu Mar 05 13:22:52 GMT 2015
I signed letter to President of China calling for his support in ending ivory trade. You can read it here: http://t.co/PRsrirQMPS Thu Mar 05 12:07:32 GMT 2015
Workers in the West Midlands did over £2bn worth of unpaid overtime last year, worth on average £5,846 each, found @MidlandsTUC Fri Feb 27 16:53:48 GMT 2015
Outrageous for private health companies to win bid to provide NHS services despite public sector putting in lower bid http://t.co/xerEryKzi0 Fri Feb 27 11:19:54 GMT 2015
Private health company won bid for cancer services despite being £7m pricier than NHS. M. Rifkind MP is on the board. http://t.co/xerEryKzi0 Fri Feb 27 11:16:47 GMT 2015
Warmest congratulations to volunteer-run trade union @United__Voices whose workers have secured London Living Wage for cleaners at Sotheby's Thu Feb 26 10:51:39 GMT 2015
Premier League: Pay ALL of your staff a Living Wage https://t.co/v2fpyaFvRo via @UKChange Wed Feb 18 15:44:13 GMT 2015
Happy 10th birthday & many happy returns to the Hunting Act. I hope to see a world where no animal is killed for "sport". #keeptheban Wed Feb 18 12:37:41 GMT 2015
Hospital outsources surgery to private provider w/ 50% complication rate, pays damages, then oursources again. Why? http://t.co/Wp8wd7RKy6 Wed Feb 18 10:59:27 GMT 2015
Is one FTSE 100 company head really worth 134 of my hard-working constituents? I think not. Workers have a right to fair pay. Mon Feb 16 13:31:02 GMT 2015
Average pay of FTSE 100 CEO in 2014 was £3,334,000, which is 134 times the average annual wage in the West Midlands #FairPayFortnight Mon Feb 16 13:27:27 GMT 2015
Pay for FTSE 100 bosses shot up by 26 per cent between 2010 and 2014, an increase of £700k in real terms #FairPayFortnight Mon Feb 16 13:24:58 GMT 2015
Average full-time employee wage in West Midlands has fallen in real terms by £2,430 since 2010, over £45 a week #FairPayFortnight @TUCnews Mon Feb 16 13:23:01 GMT 2015
Average pay in West Midlands fell by over £1,000 in real terms in 2014, found @TUCnews  #FairPayFortnight Mon Feb 16 13:22:17 GMT 2015
Businesses have responsibility to pay staff enough to survive on. Particularly businesses which pay other employees many millions #football Wed Feb 11 13:35:04 GMT 2015
74% of the £22bn the Coalition Government has cut from public services has come from women, @fawcettsociety has found Mon Feb 02 17:01:29 GMT 2015

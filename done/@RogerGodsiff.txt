@RogerGodsiff
I voted for Bill to keep NHS public. It got more than 200 votes in favour and just 20 against, as most Tories didn't bother to turn up..
Lots of constituents writing in about Friday's NHS Bill. I will vote for it- NHS should be run for public good not private profit.
Birmingham is set to lose £6,170,642 from local welfare assistance funding cuts. This funding would have supported 49,763 vulnerable people.

Annual living wage report estimates that 908,000 workers in Midlands earn less than living wage, which is equivalent to 1 in 4 workers.
If the minimum wage had increased at the same rate as CEO pay, it would be more than £18 per hour. Workers have a right to decent wage.
It is outrageous that corporate tax dodging is stealing billions from UK citizens, yet hungry people are sent to prison for stealing food.
Should prison be the punishment for the "crime" of being poor & hungry? Should people starve for missing appointment? http://t.co/Te5IIrGSAD
I support the campaign for the for the NHS Reinstatement Bill 2015. http://t.co/q6xQcObSC8 Public services are not there to make a profit.
Happy Birthday Mandatory Reconsideration! We're still waiting for our present - DWP you need to make ESA #fitforwork http://t.co/D0oz61Bx8K
Just when I think DWP can't sink lower, they take away depressed disabled constituent's Motability car so he can't leave the house. Lovely.
Govt have no idea whether culling badgers makes TB strategy more or less effective, but they're going to do it anyway http://t.co/PfA7lUB8EM
I support tomorrow's march calling for a pay rise for workers in Britain. An economic recovery is meaningless if only the rich benefit.
TUC found that we are now in the seventh year of falling average weekly earnings, the longest period since records began in the 1850s.
As of 31 August this year, 616,000 ESA claims were awaiting work capability      assessments from Atos. Totally unacceptable.
I support campaign to make revenge evictions illegal: http://t.co/QybXQbVr3i Tenants should not be exploited by landlords.
I support health workers taking strike action on Monday. Low-paid workers deserve a pay rise after years of real-terms pay cuts.
I support Monday's motion for the UK Government to recognise Palestine as a state. Palestinians have right to self-determination & freedom.
Universal Credit was designed to deal with the complicated claims but is still not ready to do so http://t.co/MyFRie1BOP @benefitsandwork
Tories' 2015 roll-out of universal credit will be for new claims for single jobseekers only. So not for any of the complicated claims...
Cameron's Tories are the first Govt since 1920s where real wages are lower at the end than the start. Growth has not gone to working people.

Why did Birmingham taxpayers have to foot the bill for the Conservative party conference? http://t.co/GCkod8BsCV
@dillydolly4 Thanks very much
@dillydolly4 Do you have more details on this?
More details on the millions of pounds of Birmingham taxpayers' money being handed over to Capita here:
http://t.co/bflaJkuPjt @dgbailey
Nice work @dgbailey for digging to find out that Brum taxpayers are gifting £23 million per year to Capita via Service Birmingham.
Service Birmingham contract gave £23 MILLION of Brum taxpayers' money to Capita in dividends last year. That is obscene & wasteful & wrong
FTSE100 CEOs earn 342x minimum wage. Is one CEO really worth 342 care workers? People who do essential work should be paid decent wage.
Since 1999, the minimum wage has increased by 81% while CEO pay has increased by 243%. Fair? Thanks for the stats, @equalitytrust
Cutting benefits will not help people struggling in minimum wage jobs. Hardworking people deserve a wage they can live on, not suffer on.
If you don't want benefit levels to rise faster than earnings, increase the minimum wage. Prices are increasing while wages are stagnating.
The reason why benefits have risen more than wages is that wages are stagnating. UK's workers deserve a pay rise & a wage they can live on.
I support @AnthonyNolan plan to encourage people to jone the bone marrow register #SaveaLifeat16
Why are Birmingham taxpayers subsidising Capita via Service Birmingham?

I have tabled PQ asking what steps the MoD will take to minimise civilian casualties in any air strikes on Iraq.
Does the current absence of any better solution for a horrendously difficult & severe problem make dropping bombs a good plan?
Lots of constituents have written to me about today's vote & all are against bombing. People are worried about civilian casualties.
Although tomorrow's House of Commons motion contains much with which I do not disagree, I will not vote for Syria strikes without UN mandate
Any action taken in Syria must have international legitimacy through the UN, which has obligation to safeguard Kurds and Yazidis.
UK should provide logistical support for attacks on Islamic State in Iraq but should not bomb Syria without a UN mandate #ISIS
Why is Birmingham Council's funding being cut by three times the national average next year, while some Tory councils receive an increase?

60% of sanctions given to ESA claimants went to people with a mental health condition or learning difficulty http://t.co/Q9dlK12XZI

DWP told my constituent to attend a one-day course instead of signing on on a certain day. Then it stopped his JSA as he hadn't signed on...
Just heard from DWP that "rate of increase in WCA backlog is beginning to slow down". Well that's alright then! Why is it still increasing??
Planned October increase to minimum wage would be equivalent only to 2005 levels in real terms due to inflation. Workers deserve fair pay

@dgbailey They claimed that was too high but had no "accurate" figure to give me instead, nor a figure for amount they have cut costs by.

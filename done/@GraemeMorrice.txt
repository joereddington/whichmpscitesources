A pleasant day out in Broxburn #nothanks http://t.co/JsHfWWl3LF
@DavidPBMaddox freak, obviously. On the ground NO vote is hardening substantially
@tim_rigby time for bed so run along and pester someone else
@tim_rigby do you want to keep the bedroom tax?
@tim_rigby why are you Tories obsessed with Europe? It will always be your downfall. John Major, Michael Howard, William Hague...
@tim_rigby the answer is a UK Labour govt and the consignment of the Tories to the dustbin of history
@tim_rigby @LouiseMensch and what Louise promised to do in Corby, etc... I thought we were discussing the bedroom tax...
@tim_rigby @GraemeMorrice @LouiseMensch Pathetic!  Can you not do better than that?  How's your bedroom tax policy doing, by the way...?
@tim_rigby @LouiseMensch perhaps we should have the referendum first, vote no and then get you Tories out at the General Election!
@tim_rigby @LouiseMensch the Act of Union between England and Scotland created the UK. Read your history!
@tim_rigby @LouiseMensch if it's a yes vote there won't be a UK, obviously. Nice one Louise, hope you're enjoying NY
@LouiseMensch bow out!
A lot of shouting from Salmond, but no credible answers. #bbcindyref #nothanks
Alex Salmond's scaremongering on the NHS is shameful #bbcindyref #nothanks #snpnhslies
A separate Scotland would need to make £6bn in cuts in public spending, meaning austerity #bbcindyref #nothanks
Alex Salmond is lying on the NHS #bbcindyref #nothanks #snpnhslies
The "Panama Plan" - using a currency without a central bank - is like driving a car without insurance. #bbcindyref #nothanks
If you don't pay your debts you get a bad credit rating. Why does Salmond want Scotland to be a Wonga economy? #bbcindyref #nothanks
Scotland deserves to know, what is Plan B on currency? #bbcindyref #nothanks
Still no Plan B on currency from Salmond #bbcindyref #nothanks
@LothianAutistic it's on my twitter profile

For all the Chancellor’s talk, my constituents are still £1500 p/a worse off while he was cutting taxes for millionaires #AS2013
If my constituents had a penny every time LibDems have been economical with a promise, they wouldn’t have to worry about #BedroomTax #PMQs

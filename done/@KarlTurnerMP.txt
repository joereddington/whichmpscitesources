Karl Turner: legal aid debate, Commons 29th June 2011@emmersonslaw  http://t.co/wqm2U08wOd
@emmersonslaw I've said plenty. I did before Evans and for your information Nigel was in the chair when I was saying and voting against it.
@jaredmac13 15k for 30 hours? #LegalAid? You sure? If you did, my advice would be not to mention the #LAA and even #SRA might wonder why?
@SummoTCB @nik1061 @shanedgj @DianaJohnsonMP 100 million so far from #Tory #LibDem Govt. SO STOP COMPLAINING AND START CAMPAIGNING!
@jaredmac13 I'm not writing the budget but I sincerely believe we must look at this to avoid such shocking injustice!
165 days 3 hours and 23 minutes to boot @David_Cameron out!  http://t.co/wm2cudhPtf
@KarlTurnerMP we REALLY MUST look at this shocking injustice when we win next year.
Innocent man but changes to #LegalAid under #Tories #LASPO means he's left with a legal bill of 30k. Is that justice? http://t.co/5zMXNMa0UQ

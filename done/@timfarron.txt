@TJJeffo we need to roll out the living wage...on foodbanks I'm a deposit point but I look forward to a closing ceremony of one Mon Apr 27 21:51:56 BST 2015
@TJJeffo but I've also voted against things like tuition fees and forestry sell off because, for me, our community comes first Mon Apr 27 21:49:48 BST 2015
@TJJeffo I'm proud of our work on pupil premium and the tax threshold increase. This makes a massive difference for local people Mon Apr 27 21:48:27 BST 2015
@TJJeffo we did try electoral reform! But I do need your help. Its a choice between me and the conservative. I do need your help Mon Apr 27 21:39:12 BST 2015

@raging_reg trying to! :) Fri Apr 24 20:53:42 BST 2015
@sunnyhowgills We need to do more to help people and offer much better after care. Fri Apr 24 18:09:28 BST 2015
@sunnyhowgills I said it was always a tragedy but we must not change the law. My view is clear on this. Fri Apr 24 18:08:28 BST 2015
Today postal votes for the local elections have been landing on doormats throughout South Lakeland. Tomorrow,... http://t.co/HC5KL7udN6 Fri Apr 24 17:59:46 BST 2015
@imgladallover They do, of course, when they are there. Obviously when they are not there...those local services are not. Fri Apr 24 17:54:15 BST 2015
@kevhobster @JasperGerardLD Hope it's going well! Fri Apr 24 17:43:28 BST 2015
@imgladallover Extra revenue schemes will allow a community pot to be built up to support services like the Post Office, pub or even GPs Fri Apr 24 17:35:18 BST 2015
@imgladallover In the village of Elterwater in the Langdale valley, 85% of properties are not lived in permanently. Fri Apr 24 17:34:48 BST 2015
@imgladallover They are and as a result should put in to keep communities alive. Fri Apr 24 17:34:42 BST 2015
@TheGamechanger @LibDems @George_Osborne Not sure! I just guess they get given the new one! Fri Apr 24 17:14:21 BST 2015
@TheGamechanger @LibDems It will do ;) Fri Apr 24 17:00:54 BST 2015
@TheGamechanger @LibDems @theSNP Hope you have a Lib Dem one there too! Fri Apr 24 16:58:51 BST 2015
@imgladallover We think communities should have the power to decide. Fri Apr 24 16:56:03 BST 2015
@TheGamechanger @LibDems HAHA! Hope you are well Archie! Fri Apr 24 16:53:26 BST 2015

@RickCrawley @DecencyCommon Thanks Fri Apr 24 09:53:26 BST 2015
@jennyvelo I think we need to up spending to £10 per person per year.  I've called for better infrastructure: http://t.co/7kuPV0GZiw Fri Apr 24 09:53:20 BST 2015
@Nickjames40Nick 12k Thu Apr 23 22:27:02 BST 2015
@ellivlum I agree. But sadly we have the system we have and a vote for Labour and the Greens round here makes a Tory MP a bit more likely Thu Apr 23 21:17:31 BST 2015
@ellivlum In the South Lakes - its a choice between myself and the Tories. A vote for anyone else makes a Tory MP more likely. Thu Apr 23 19:34:39 BST 2015
@ellivlum My view is that we need to change the electoral system. But sadly we have the system we have. Thu Apr 23 19:34:05 BST 2015
GOOD NEWS! The iconic beauty spot Stickle Tarn has today been listed as an Asset of Community Value.

@StephenPotter22 Thank you. Happy to chat about this if you'd like! :) Thu Apr 23 09:54:15 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 Furthermore, it actually helps the housing market...boosting both supply and demand. Thu Apr 23 09:49:04 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 I don't think we shouldn't build some truly affordable. We are building thousands...but we are building some Thu Apr 23 09:48:35 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 It does pay...and it should...but we shouldn't pull the ladder up on other people. Thu Apr 23 09:47:41 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 So we need to offer a mix of solutions - build more social houses, affordable rent, affordable to buy. Thu Apr 23 09:47:01 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 Sadly our wage to house price ratio...at the moment is too high. It means young people will never pay off their mortgage. Thu Apr 23 09:45:54 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 We need to sell properties at a 'truly affordable'  rate...to allow young people to get on the property ladder in the Lakes Thu Apr 23 09:45:13 BST 2015
@StephenPotter22 When you say learn the truth what do you mean sorry? Thu Apr 23 09:38:05 BST 2015

@Neilccfc @ChrisJLatimer I disagree with that. Mon Apr 20 14:15:22 BST 2015
@Neilccfc @ChrisJLatimer To stop a massacre. Mon Apr 20 14:09:10 BST 2015
@miss_s_b Good! I must do that too! Mon Apr 20 14:02:15 BST 2015
@wheatcroft_dave @mencap_charity Thanks. Happy to support. Mon Apr 20 14:00:04 BST 2015
@miss_s_b @libdemvoice It wasn't intended as so. It was written last week. We need to re-start S&R. Simple as. Mon Apr 20 13:59:51 BST 2015
@miss_s_b @libdemvoice Can't see a comment? Mon Apr 20 13:48:33 BST 2015

@miss_s_b @A_C_McGregor Good stuff! Mon Apr 20 13:47:13 BST 2015
@stupotackers I'd be interested to know how many people have filled that in? Labour only got 2% in 2010. Mon Apr 20 13:47:00 BST 2015

@Kav_Kaushik @AbBrightman I agree. It's not backed up by evidence and is self defeating. Mon Apr 20 13:28:02 BST 2015
@ChrisJLatimer Thanks Mon Apr 20 13:27:44 BST 2015
@AbBrightman @Kav_Kaushik V kind! Mon Apr 20 13:27:39 BST 2015

@HelenPateman I'd give MP's pay rise to them if I had my way! Mon Apr 20 12:13:52 BST 2015
@HelenPateman I'd be pushing to divert money from execs to front line staff - they deserve the pay rise Mon Apr 20 11:57:13 BST 2015

@mamajunkyard We have laws for that. Sun Apr 19 15:04:36 BST 2015
@mamajunkyard and I defend that right.  I will obviously disagree with them/their views - not buy their publication but i'm not a censor Sun Apr 19 15:02:26 BST 2015
@mamajunkyard I wouldn't 'no platform' anyone.  I'm a liberal, even if I disagree utterly...people have a right to say what they want Sun Apr 19 15:01:31 BST 2015
@mamajunkyard I agree but we tackle her views by debating with them and showing them to be utterly false, wrong and inaccurate. Sun Apr 19 14:59:24 BST 2015

@simonasylvester @JonathanHumble They usually suggest, what I think are simple and much needed reforms. Ones I've pushed for repeatedly Fri Apr 17 12:47:00 BST 2015
@simonasylvester @JonathanHumble I hear complaints about Ofsted, please don't get me wrong...but never heard a teacher say to me 'axe it' Fri Apr 17 12:46:16 BST 2015
@JonathanHumble Please do - no rush! But keen to hear your ideas! Fri Apr 17 12:45:05 BST 2015
@JonathanHumble I agree with that. I said exactly that at the #wgdebate :) Fri Apr 17 12:43:50 BST 2015
@JonathanHumble As I said last night at the debate. We need to move away from teaching to the test and to a more child centred philosophy Fri Apr 17 12:42:57 BST 2015
@JonathanHumble Always keen to hear different views - would you have 5 mins to email me your thoughts? Fri Apr 17 12:42:12 BST 2015
@JonathanHumble I think Ofsted needs reform. Not sure about binning. Not had a teacher ever say that to me Fri Apr 17 12:39:55 BST 2015
@FendyreeDuratho As always, lets have a chat.... Fri Apr 17 12:37:08 BST 2015

@pual9 @realArtisan that sounds like you are arguing for majoritarian politics. The UK is moving, thankfully towards European pluralist Tue Apr 14 23:03:14 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere was in Liverpool last week. Its a wonderful city. Tue Apr 14 23:01:39 BST 2015
@pual9 @realArtisan not sure that's fair. Tue Apr 14 22:59:14 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere where do you live now? Tue Apr 14 22:47:24 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere in the last year. Tue Apr 14 22:32:13 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere and her family took it on Tue Apr 14 22:27:19 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere we tried to convince other people to come in - lots of issues, red tape etc and eventually @HeidiHalliday Tue Apr 14 22:27:09 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere yes there was. Postmaster was retiring and usually when that happens PO Ltd close a branch. Tue Apr 14 22:26:20 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere it would have caused massive issues for the community and the team stepped in to fix it. Tue Apr 14 22:23:21 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry there are lots and lots more that @HeidiHalliday  and Vivienne have done Tue Apr 14 22:21:45 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry I think if you are a community group and now have funding you disagree! Tue Apr 14 22:21:14 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere it was just going to close. One of the councillors stepped in and now runs it Tue Apr 14 22:19:26 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry secured funding for local good causes & community projects Tue Apr 14 22:18:36 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry helped me save the uni campus in Ambleside. Tue Apr 14 22:17:52 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry they saved Grasmere's Post Office! Tue Apr 14 22:17:29 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry they get things done! And work v hard for the community. Tue Apr 14 22:16:18 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry Grasmere has 2 lib dem councillors Tue Apr 14 22:14:07 BST 2015
@DansLife86 @SH_Grasmere @cllrbenberry oops. Sorry long day! Thought you said Coniston... Tue Apr 14 22:13:49 BST 2015
@realArtisan that's something I guess ;) Tue Apr 14 21:48:46 BST 2015
@realArtisan I hope in the next 23 days I can convince you to support me. Tue Apr 14 21:46:14 BST 2015
@fcuk81 @mark4ceredigion interesting point. Not heard anyone mention that before Tue Apr 14 21:45:51 BST 2015
@BeauxHannah @LiberalYouth @LibDems welcome Hannah! Tue Apr 14 21:44:48 BST 2015
@realArtisan I never assumed it would. I am working hard for every vote. Tue Apr 14 21:40:50 BST 2015
@realArtisan no I understand. Different mix of local/national different people. Tue Apr 14 21:40:03 BST 2015
@fcuk81 @mark4ceredigion why do you say that? Never heard anyone say that. Tue Apr 14 21:37:38 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick I guess we will see. Its the most volatile election in a generation. But happy to chat about this face 2 face Tue Apr 14 21:36:25 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick you are electing a local MP! Tue Apr 14 21:32:12 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick our manifesto is announced tomorrow but our 2014 housing policy motion is here: http://t.co/4cwvKGDfXp Tue Apr 14 21:31:32 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick well you are voting for a local MP. You know me well enough to know where I stand. Tue Apr 14 21:27:27 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick not sure that's fair Simon. Why don't we have a chat about this? Tue Apr 14 21:25:22 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick the other point I'd make is that if you lay out your red lines early..you get a bad deal. Tue Apr 14 21:24:34 BST 2015
@realArtisan @brianpaddick because we need to have the election! But you know my view... Tue Apr 14 21:24:04 BST 2015
@fcuk81 @mark4ceredigion I think it shows that people across the spectrum are liberal! Tue Apr 14 21:22:05 BST 2015
@realArtisan my good friend @brianpaddick has set out our view here: http://t.co/dqYU10rclA Tue Apr 14 21:18:49 BST 2015
@realArtisan I'm speaking for myself. Tue Apr 14 21:15:56 BST 2015
@sunny_hundal that's my personal view. Tue Apr 14 21:13:38 BST 2015
@realArtisan as you know...I agree with that. Tue Apr 14 21:13:28 BST 2015
@realArtisan my values and my position on this. Tue Apr 14 21:11:24 BST 2015
@realArtisan yes you should. Because you know what I think about this. We can't guess what will happen or a coalition deal but you know.. Tue Apr 14 21:10:56 BST 2015
@littlealb @PaulHindley2210 @LibDems thanks Allan! Tue Apr 14 21:06:20 BST 2015
@PaulHindley2210 :) Tue Apr 14 21:05:34 BST 2015
@realArtisan we have no idea what the election will lead to. But you know my view.. Tue Apr 14 21:05:24 BST 2015
@realArtisan sadly the Tories opposed it. I've RTd a link with details about it Tue Apr 14 21:02:57 BST 2015
@PaulHindley2210 thanks! Look forward to seeing you soon. Tue Apr 14 21:02:11 BST 2015
@realArtisan @Steven_Barber as I said...I proposed a bill this year to allow councils to opt out. Tue Apr 14 21:01:42 BST 2015
@realArtisan you beat me to it. I agree Tue Apr 14 21:00:59 BST 2015
@DanKellyEsq @DavidHansonMP @ConHistGrp thanks! Tue Apr 14 21:00:42 BST 2015
@realArtisan selling social housing is madness. We need more, not less. Tue Apr 14 21:00:11 BST 2015
@realArtisan I proposed a bill in February to allow councils to opt out of right to buy Tue Apr 14 20:59:48 BST 2015
@StuartRoyClarke thanks. Will keep working hard for local people! Tue Apr 14 20:58:53 BST 2015

@raging_reg @normanlamb Yes - I cannot believe that was even suggested, Tue Apr 14 12:38:12 BST 2015
@raging_reg @normanlamb Will read. But isn't this the wristaband comment? Tue Apr 14 12:35:05 BST 2015

@Noordad @sarahteather v kind. But I'm a liberal to my core. Will never change. Mon Apr 13 21:13:04 BST 2015

@grangeweather I imagine you will be getting something asap! Mon Apr 13 17:33:02 BST 2015
@grangeweather Hopefully you have heard off us! Mon Apr 13 17:30:28 BST 2015
@grangeweather Taking nothing for granted and working v hard on jobs, investment, defending our hospital and apprenticeships Mon Apr 13 17:27:40 BST 2015
@erinp0ynter Always good to have a debate! Mon Apr 13 17:17:46 BST 2015
@cassmcgood @chimchirwa If I can help in any way please let me know! Mon Apr 13 17:17:19 BST 2015
@binny_uk Haha Mon Apr 13 16:18:13 BST 2015

@MissLauraMarcus @lauradavies24 @zoeamar @LondonKirsty @ChukaUmunna @stellacreasy As long as we recycle I don't mind the colour of the box! Mon Apr 13 14:38:50 BST 2015

@RichdelaRiv Will do! Mon Apr 13 12:31:49 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv Still 20odd days to work on you! ;) Mon Apr 13 12:18:11 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv Shame - well I hope I can convince you that you need to hold your nose and vote Lib Dem. It's v important! Mon Apr 13 12:09:23 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv But I appreciate your views and agree a positive message is needed and I do try to offer that :) Mon Apr 13 12:06:02 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv I think it's important to say to voters the choice is stark. Mon Apr 13 12:04:42 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv they might not agree 100% with the govt - they see that I stand up for our area and vote community first. Mon Apr 13 12:01:40 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv Well I knock on a lot of doors and people say - that I agree with them on the living wage, environmental issues etc and Mon Apr 13 12:01:15 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv You wont get an MP who stands up on regional pay and on many other issues that we both care about. Mon Apr 13 11:58:46 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv The message is that it is a two horse race - if you vote green or Lab here you get a Tory MP Mon Apr 13 11:58:05 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv The other point did. You send two tweets, I answered them both. Mon Apr 13 11:56:02 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv The choice here is clear - either Tories or us. A vote for anyone else is a vote less the Tories need. It's a 2 horse race Mon Apr 13 11:55:01 BST 2015
@RichdelaRiv Our message is positive - on jobs, apprenticeships, investment and infrastructure. Mon Apr 13 11:54:19 BST 2015
@stephenob21002 ;) Good to hear! Mon Apr 13 10:40:13 BST 2015
@stemurray68 That's good to hear! Mon Apr 13 10:40:01 BST 2015

@JamesWHarrison How are you James? PS - Been out all day has Hillary announced? Sun Apr 12 19:16:46 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Always happy to debate/discuss/engage but no real need for your tone... Sun Apr 12 17:26:04 BST 2015
@ReachEd @hsmall I will go away and think about this again! I will go and speak to a few registrars! Sun Apr 12 17:24:09 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Again, that's unfair. Sun Apr 12 17:20:20 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I believe that the overwhelming, overwhelming majority would be happy to officiate over a SSM ceremony. Sun Apr 12 17:19:06 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd That is what I'm saying, not what you are alluding to. Sun Apr 12 17:18:07 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I am saying that if people have moral reasons that they do not want participate...as a liberal I should try to understand. Sun Apr 12 17:17:50 BST 2015
@penninevale @soclibforum @LancsLabour @thefabians @bellacaledonia @GeneralElec2015 http://t.co/rSgBSDM9aQ Sun Apr 12 17:14:07 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I was voting to make this in line with the NHS. No more, no less. Sun Apr 12 17:07:42 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd That's unfair Sun Apr 12 17:04:51 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I was in Green Park tube station at the time of the vote if I remember rightly. Sun Apr 12 17:02:47 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I've answered. Sun Apr 12 17:02:06 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Did I have concerns, yes, would I have voted for it? Yes I think I would. Sun Apr 12 17:01:53 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Not being slippery - just being honest, I don't go in for counter-factual history. Sun Apr 12 17:00:55 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I would never have voted against. Sun Apr 12 16:52:42 BST 2015
@ReachEd @hsmall I guess not! Sun Apr 12 16:49:58 BST 2015
@ReachEd @hsmall They said it was 'critical' to their vote...I said then you cannot support me. Sorry. Sun Apr 12 16:47:36 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Not sure that's fair! Sun Apr 12 16:46:27 BST 2015
@ReachEd @hsmall Yes - I thought it was one of the most interesting interviews I've done! Sun Apr 12 16:45:51 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd It is law and should not be repealed. Sun Apr 12 16:45:24 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd I was asked last week if I would support a SSM repeal bill by a constituent - and I said I would vote no. Sun Apr 12 16:45:10 BST 2015
@ReachEd @hsmall Thanks. Was a quite wide ranging interview! Sun Apr 12 16:43:38 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Clarify what sorry? Sun Apr 12 16:34:47 BST 2015
@stemurray68 @LibDems We need to build homes and locally we are doing that - a mix and different types! We will keep working at it Sun Apr 12 16:28:45 BST 2015
@hsmall @ReachEd Hi both, I was asked about this recently (in the middle of the piece - I think): http://t.co/Q9nftO2dvW Sun Apr 12 16:22:32 BST 2015

@LiamJMcGoldrick We have already said.. that we will speak first to the party with the most votes in the Commons. Sat Apr 11 15:39:22 BST 2015
@LiamJMcGoldrick No...as I said to Total Politics recently it's up to the voters. They will give us the arithmetic. We go from there Sat Apr 11 15:36:23 BST 2015
@dpwilki We are launching a consultation but have suggested some things. More info here: http://t.co/LCBIbuZTc3 Sat Apr 11 15:33:49 BST 2015

@NHSinNW Just had another complaint that a poster was put up without permission. They assumed the 'council' did it. Wed Apr 08 16:28:15 BST 2015
@colingale I agree Wed Apr 08 16:23:08 BST 2015

@Mintcake87 I have had at least one other person say exactly that to me (about a different poster area) Wed Apr 08 15:10:49 BST 2015
@Mintcake87 They say they did and sought permission. Wed Apr 08 15:08:02 BST 2015
@Mintcake87 Also reports that lampposts have been flyered with them. It's not on and I've asked the council & police to sort it asap Wed Apr 08 15:07:13 BST 2015
@Mintcake87 I have had complaints from people saying the same things....like they didnt give permission or didn't want them Wed Apr 08 15:06:43 BST 2015
@Mintcake87 Hi Sarah - is that a TTIP poster or a Lib Dem election one? Wed Apr 08 15:03:47 BST 2015

@NHSinNW We have been clear - unlike you. Will you remove the flyposters? Or do I need to contact the authorities? Wed Apr 08 12:03:16 BST 2015
@npdkendal PS - Thanks for the link. Will read in my lunchbreak today Wed Apr 08 11:43:47 BST 2015
@NHSinNW PS - You should take down the lamppost posters asap. Will you do that? Or do I need to to take this further? Wed Apr 08 11:37:18 BST 2015
@NHSinNW Our view is here: http://t.co/QXRNtK7tuk My staff told you exactly this... yet you keep asking. Wed Apr 08 11:24:51 BST 2015
@NHSinNW So you are not going to fix this then? Wed Apr 08 10:06:58 BST 2015
@NHSinNW PS - Also the ones on lamposts need to be removed. Wed Apr 08 10:03:15 BST 2015
@NHSinNW I think you need to fix it....you need to remove the posters that don't have permission. And quickly... Wed Apr 08 10:01:59 BST 2015

@HowardTurnerGoS @nick_clegg no. That's not what I did or said or meant Thu Apr 02 22:46:00 BST 2015
@alexrigbyy great! Thu Apr 02 22:44:45 BST 2015
@HowardTurnerGoS @nick_clegg I was talking about the politics. I hold myself to account for that. I didn't sell the message well enough Thu Apr 02 22:40:29 BST 2015
@HowardTurnerGoS @nick_clegg no that's not true. Thu Apr 02 22:39:44 BST 2015
@chrisold86 @nick_clegg no I'm not. Thu Apr 02 22:27:01 BST 2015
@Mr_Winstanley @nick_clegg yep Thu Apr 02 22:23:53 BST 2015
@jpsilcocks @nick_clegg proud then too Thu Apr 02 22:22:57 BST 2015
@chrisold86 @nick_clegg I'd disagree. A lot Thu Apr 02 22:22:35 BST 2015
I was at the Manchester debate in 2010 and I'm just as proud of @nick_clegg tonight as I was then. Decent, competent, tolerant, inspiring! Thu Apr 02 22:19:50 BST 2015
@Alex_Boothe @Channel4News @normanlamb yes it is Thu Apr 02 22:05:57 BST 2015
@SathanSathy @ImogenSD no we are saying we will cut less than the Tories and spend less than labour. Thu Apr 02 21:16:03 BST 2015
@two46 @stephen_gilbert are we going to meet? Nice to put a face to twitter account Thu Apr 02 21:07:11 BST 2015
@craig_mccarron @stephen_gilbert have no problem with strong debate...but i have a problem with the politics of division Thu Apr 02 21:03:05 BST 2015
@two46 @stephen_gilbert not true. At all Thu Apr 02 20:59:51 BST 2015
@craig_mccarron @stephen_gilbert helping is one thing; playing the politics of division is another Thu Apr 02 20:57:07 BST 2015
@gemmataylor366 @George_Osborne @andyburnhammp I think this is exciting enough! Thu Apr 02 20:47:29 BST 2015

@RichardRDancy thank you Thu Apr 02 20:19:18 BST 2015
Good to see Cameron mention the raising of personal tax allowance...in the 2010 debates he said it was unaffordable! Lib Dems delivered it. Thu Apr 02 20:16:40 BST 2015

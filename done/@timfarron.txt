@EmmaGreen__ @CumbriaSU I'd re-read what I've actually said. I never said I did it all. I said it was one of my proudest achievements.
@suttonnick have a good weekend Nick.
@ProfTimBale @BBCWorldatOne @suttonnick Have a good weekend.
@ProfTimBale @BBCWorldatOne @suttonnick There goes our friends forever collage...
@_tommylong @DanKellyEsq @chrisccoulson @HulbertMathew New fact of the day! I had no idea.
@mumofjackandsam @ReachEd @trevdick @colingale Thank you
@ReachEd @colingale Thanks. This tweet has made my day.

@ReachEd I don't mind. Always happy to engage!
@willmill82 Oh with you now! Hadn't spotted that!
@HulbertMathew @DanKellyEsq I never ignore you Mat. Always listen and engage.
@HulbertMathew @DanKellyEsq You can always do more and we will keep trying!
South Lakeland Mind have announced that they have raised over £50,000!!!

The charity had been facing the threat... http://t.co/83Y0viMJT7
@DanKellyEsq @HulbertMathew Agreed
@HulbertMathew @jon_gleeson Please do email me Mat and I will take any comments you have to the campaigns committee.
@jon_gleeson @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress Well said Jon.
@jamesmaxwell86 Glad to have a chance to clarify then.
@jamesmaxwell86 Was trying to get a slight dig in about the various UKIP wings...not sure it worked.
@jamesmaxwell86 Have a good day!
@jon_gleeson @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress Thanks :)
@LibDemSimon @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews It's both of them - with a good team of Lib Dem ministers.
@HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews Imagine Nick is running the country!
@jrfearnley @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews We should comment. We shouldn't be empty chaired IMO.
@colingale @jamesrobking Thanks both. I concur about EU reform proposals!
@HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews They are just doing their job.
@jamesmaxwell86 Happy to - UKIP.
@timprater @LibDemPress @BBCNews Thanks Tim.

@SamButler2805 @BBCRadio4 Thanks.
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems @itvnews @nick_clegg What else would you like me to do?
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems @itvnews @nick_clegg Our policy is there- and is clear. I've said my view A LOT.
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems The members have spoken. We have passed policy on fees.
@libdemsteve1 thx
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems My views on this are well known.
@libdemsteve1 Pls do email me.
@carollowe98 Yes
@pembertonjillho Hi Jill, I'm meeting Vince sadly not in Westminster to talk about TTIP and other issues
@suzykenyo Hi Suzy, I'm meeting Vince sadly not in Westminster to talk about TTIP and other issues
@carollowe98 In London today and then train up
@kendalgiant I disagree with him on global warming.  I think the evidence is overwhelming.
@JRfromStrickley No problem.
@JRfromStrickley It's a vital issue and delighted to support :)
@JRfromStrickley No problem - hope you are well.
@jerijerod14 :)
@JustinWalkerBCG @stevebeasant We disagree on this.
@JRfromStrickley @NewHutton I've RT'd :)
@jackdavies4317 @LibDemConf @LibDems @GoodallGiles @nick_clegg @ArfanBhatti1 @lfeatherstone agreed :)
@jerijerod14 sorry I missed you too!
@whysomanypeople @RoryStewartUK think you are wrong there. Hope you are well though.
@whysomanypeople @RoryStewartUK not sure I agree with that.

@CllrMcAuley @YouGov appears not! :)
@CllrMcAuley will keep an eye out for the result!
@CllrMcAuley how do you think its gone?
@markhughes @libdemvoice we are not going to agree on this...
@KristinaML90 @LibDems thank you :)
@markhughes @libdemvoice have you googled my view on fracking?
@SportiveLakes @kayaburgess @JWoodcockMP will read. Thanks.
@EmilyTesterLD its a brilliant fact
@EmilyTesterLD that's my new fact of the day!
@WheelhouseGS what is this scheme?
@WheelhouseGS what issue in particular? I try and raise lots of issues :)
@pastieman69 sorry to hear that.
@pastieman69 I was offering to make representations on your behalf to do my job.
@pastieman69 I am doing my job. I'm meeting a cabinet minister to discuss an issue that concerns many constituents.
@pastieman69 I'd be happy to make representations on your behalf to tim@timfarron.co.UK and I will do that asap.
@pastieman69 I have raised issues from the bill with ministers already and will do so again.
@pastieman69 I'm actually meeting Vince to talk TTIP and other issues but he's not in Westminster so I won't be either.
@sjharte I have tried to listen, learn and engage as any good liberal should do :)
@BazPos It will come out of the aid budget. Good news.
@JessOttowell I agree - @Kirsty_Williams, @ElunedParrottAM and the team are doing great things on this. V supportive on their work.
@JessOttowell :) Thanks
On #transdayofremembrance we honour the victims of transphobic violence and continue to fight intolerance -  one step at a time.
@KendalFruitCake @Neil_GPmag @SuzanneEvans1 Obviously I'm saying there is no reason for MP *NOT* to pay this 2nd homes tax - they should.
@Neil_GPmag @SuzanneEvans1 @KendalFruitCake Wonder if Suzanne will re-tweet that? ;)
@JamesWorron I recently did the Beveridge lecture which you can find here: http://t.co/DcZl22ps5u
@SailormanIan https://t.co/YAZ94rZug0
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale :D
@powellds Thanks for this.
@Kav_Kaushik @Martin_Veart @GrahamNeale Well thank you very much :) Very kind.
@Kav_Kaushik @Martin_Veart @GrahamNeale Dont think so! It was in the Indy a while ago!
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale Honest answer is that I don't.
UK giving £720m to intl #climate fund is welcome news. Beveridge liberals know that tackling climate is the biggest new 'ill' we face
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale I am yes.
@matt_tennant Or @HeidiHalliday has said she'd like to see health services in there.
@matt_tennant Yes - I'd like to see green tech start up businesses in there.
@wildwomanswims1 Voted for the bill and against parts.
@paulcotswolds Keep up the good work Paul
@McFarlandFraser Dont see why not.

@colingale @nick_clegg It's more about party morale rather than actually the issues of the day.
@BenForRSN @tes :) Thanks Ben
@APFaz I support HS2.
@MJohn59655 Yes I have said that in my comment which can be found here: http://t.co/tDuyKvmGIf
@PETRIEDESIGN @GeorgeMonbiot Will read.
GOOD NEWS! Premier Inn has pulled out of plans to open a £5 million hotel at a specific building in Ambleside.

@Jongriffiths14 I haven't signed the EDM but have made many representations on behalf of local ff to ministers. Will keep doing so.
@HarisonPlant @UKinUkraine me too. We need to follow that up with more action too...
@miketmullaney @scottishliberal I'm proud to be supporting your campaign!
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal sorry just thought I should cite my sources!
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal government.
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal  website as saying that Tredinnick is "perhaps the worst example of scientific illiteracy in
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal quote in full: Elizabeth Gibney inTimes Higher Education quoted the Skeptical Voter
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal I hope so. We need you. I have had enough of his scientific illiteracy.
@shugwud @FutureAmbleside @HeidiHalliday thank you :)
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal you are doing a brilliant job!
@HappyMaverick @DrJennyWoods sounds good!
@HulbertMathew @scottishliberal @miketmullaney he will be a brilliant MP. We need him in Westminster.
@HulbertMathew @scottishliberal @willmill82 well said!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 very fair point!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 glad to help!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 its good news :)
@scottishliberal If I can help in any way please let me know.
@scottishliberal need more time in the day or a twin! How's being a PPC?
@scottishliberal well said! How are you?
@MR_JustinTaylor nice to see you!
@HappyMaverick @Matt_Severn @LibDems as soon as they all selected!
@HappyMaverick @Matt_Severn @LibDems we won't soon!
@henryadamsUK Thanks - will look later.  Signing off twitter for a bit. Thanks for the link.
Congratulations to @Matt_Severn for being selected as the @LibDems Parliamentary Candidate for #Morecambe & #Lunesdale
@brianjcapstick Granted. Totally fair point and I hopefully just said that in my other tweet :)
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk But we can do better and I will keep doing all I can to help them!
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk But many towns like Sedbergh, Bowness and Ambleside to name but 3 are doing amazingly too.
@750VFR or give me a call on 01539 723403 or pop along to a surgery. Happy to help in any way I can
@750VFR But the ASDA/Morrisons ones are in the cafe so not really appropriate for very personal issues.  If can help pls email me
@henryadamsUK Will read tonight. Thanks
@brianjcapstick But I meant as in big town...if that classification exists!
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk Well quite a lot of stats! Investment, unemployment figures, apprenticeships to name three
@750VFR I'd argue that 2nd home owners need those services too when they stay in their properties. They need a bus or a Post Office.
@750VFR Usually in private - I have a staff member there who has signed a confidentially agreement
@henryadamsUK Happy to,
@samdwebber @SimonHughesMP Glad to help!
@henryadamsUK Hi Henry, I'm sorry I can't attend.  I'm at events all day Thursday.
@samdwebber @SimonHughesMP RT'd ;)
@Bobby_Dean Look forward to seeing you again! Let's have another chat.  Be good to catch up!
@Bobby_Dean Yes it is! Hope to see you there?
@Bobby_Dean :) Hope so!
@750VFR It's both actually.  But it's also things like seasonality too being a tourist area,
@HeidiHalliday Two wins in two days! Well done.
@oldlefty47 Happy to deliver any message to him :)
@oldlefty47 I'm actually at a meeting this Friday not in Westminster talking to Vince about TTIP amongst other things.
@_tommylong Thanks - will read :)
@_tommylong Do you have a link?
WE WON! http://t.co/RhH0ailc5C Well done @FutureAmbleside & @HeidiHalliday - Great news!
@EllisButcher @npdkendal Brilliant news! We won!
@Bobby_Dean @HuffPostUK Thanks Bobby. Hope you are well!
@TeamGabalfa @ElunedParrottAM Seconded.
@29leeFinch Thanks Lee :)
@patrickhaveron Thank you :)
@syki264 I agree I try to listen to the experts in areas like this.
@syki264 I have asked for that information.
@Andrew_S_Hatton I try and deal with urgent emails first - homeless people etc try and deal with policy questions asap.
@syki264 Seems a bit bonkers to me! Surely there is a sensible middle way. What do you think?
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio Thanks - will read it tonight on the train!
@rorymeakin make the communities that 2nd homes owners use. PS they also get a discount on CT.
@rorymeakin It's mixed.  Services used in summer -heavily then less so in the rest of the year. But these services like PO, Pubs etc
@1992Higgin v kind.
@rorymeakin ...GP surgeries have little demand? In the Lake District? Really?
@PaulHindley2210 Thanks Paul -appreciate it!
@andrewgill1984 Thank you :)
@juliacambridge1 @HulbertMathew Thank you both.
@HulbertMathew :)
@Just_Will_I_am @HulbertMathew Thank you :)

@reporterboy Thanks
@juliacambridge1 Thanks Julia - more info here: http://t.co/CpgNAxSTPM
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio I am! Keen to do more so any ideas are very welcome.
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio Really good column and it's great to see startups getting political.
These Mark Reckless comments show UKIP’s true colours. Reckless and UKIP have not been misunderstood, they have been found out.
@NorthSouthApp @HuffPostUK Thanks - will do.
@lauradavies24 @MissLauraMarcus V kind :)
@lauradavies24 @MissLauraMarcus I try to be! :) I think if people take the time to get in touch...I NEED to reply.
Well done @Kirsty_Williams -Welsh Liberal Democrats to hold Assembly debate on Transgender awareness http://t.co/WVDAZQ30vr via @libdemvoice
@cleslie92 I like her a lot too. Very impressive..
@cleslie92 I agree. I though Ruth & Willie's were v good... Some less so...
@H_Bettsworth please let me know how it goes!
@H_Bettsworth have my fingers and toes crossed for you!
@H_Bettsworth looks great!
@H_Bettsworth what are you applying for?
@H_Bettsworth just working! Glad its going well :)
@H_Bettsworth hope Spain is going well :)
@lfeatherstone @IainDale is a good journalist but more than that he's a decent & lovely man. Even though we don't always agree politically!
@jpfuller74 I believe it is needed. Teaching is a profession and should be treated as such.
@dandoj @jameswesthead thanks :)
@jpfuller74 I hope it will be different this time
@Drew_Peacock123 @Wren_Alan haha!
@chezmacc thank you so much :)
@Wren_Alan Is it? ;) I've honestly not been following it!
@750VFR @BazPos :)
@750VFR @BazPos I do answer emails/work on a Sunday but I'm at home so not really 'working' if you know what I mean
@chezmacc I have been doing a lot on this in the last few weeks. Could you email me?
@BazPos @750VFR you need to do both IMO.
@750VFR @BazPos meet on a Saturday... I do ask..a lot!
@750VFR @BazPos I work 6 days a week. I sometimes need to be in Kendal as many people (usually public sector) won't come to London or
@BazPos I won't be in London on Friday sadly as I have a set of meetings that I can't move. Have tried to raise issues though
@PETRIEDESIGN @GeorgeMonbiot Thanks for your thoughts :)
@GlynLey Interesting point.  In other parties you become a SpAD then into a safe seat.
@PETRIEDESIGN @GeorgeMonbiot Will read - thanks.
@BazPos :)
@BelindaBG The problems with linking your facebook page to your twitter! :)
This morning I've welcomed the news that Cumbria county council has axed the plan to bring in on street car... http://t.co/6n87QEefpV
@DanSilverSARF @tomslater42 @djmgaffneyw4 I treat everything I'm told with a dose of skepticism. ;)
@tomslater42 @DanSilverSARF @djmgaffneyw4 Following both now - thanks
@newapproach_UK @Mylegalforum will read. Thanks.
@pastieman69 I want to close this off asap
@pastieman69 I haven't had chance to speak to the council yet. But the PR read to me as they have left their options open.
@tomslater42 just because I speak/listen to the CSJ as well as other orgs on the left and in the centre too? I'd call that sensible!
@pastieman69 and Simon Thomas. I played a supporting role. They deserve the credit.
@pastieman69 morning Mike. I did a lot of lobbying over many months on this but the praise should GOTO people like Bill Smith and
@Sed_Sedgwick but thank you :)
@Sed_Sedgwick I met Sedbergh School on Friday. Don't think I'm meeting them again for a little bit.
@jacqc1 @Tubby_Isaacs @csjthinktank thanks. Appreciate the link.
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank have a good evening :)
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank we are not going to agree on this. Sorry!
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank do I always agree with them - no. Are they a force for good in the debate - without a shadow of a doubt
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank I look at lots of evidence and speak to lots of experts. I think the CSJ do great work in poverty issues
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank A good idea is a good idea no matter where it come from.
@JamesTitcombe @masters_nik @ShaunLintern @JackieDanielNHS I have a lot of confidence in Jackie personally and her wider management team.
@masters_nik @ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP I'm not sure a system changes automatically.. But understand your argument.
@retireenjoy imagine its on war on wants website.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP fair point.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP actually praise them if they do well.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP really? That's not on. This information should be public. Only way we hold them to account and..
@jacqc1 @csjthinktank I will watch the programme first...
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP I was eventually sent the report. The media got it first.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP that's what I was saying.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP To me it shows how we must change the culture and how hard that is to change.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP UHMBT has made bug strides forward but we must remember that the inquiry is ongoing.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP looks like it been changed. Not omission.
@BazPos @JWoodcockMP will have a read - thanks.
@AMcGAshington @LibDems thanks!
@gmbutts @JustinTrudeau @VoteCelina sorry yes. Will keep my eye out for the result!
@gmbutts @JustinTrudeau @VoteCelina is the election today?
@brownrachel1 have followed you. Hope it works now :)
@brownrachel1 thank you :)
@brownrachel1 @Brakecharity do we have any Cumbrian figures on this?
@HulbertMathew @LibDems thanks
@retireenjoy we need to see the detail. I get LOTS and LOTS of emails/tweets like this. More info here: https://t.co/UhMXo4WxQm
@TheBagfish @miss_s_b @Calderdale_LD v kind of them to invite me along. :)
@csjthinktank thank you :)
@csjthinktank I'm on a train so will try and watch on 4OD. But do you have the research behind the show?
@A_C_McGregor @miss_s_b @samphripp no problem. Glad to come!
@miss_s_b @samphripp v kind. Thanks.
@miss_s_b @samphripp thank you for having me :)
@Calderdale_LD @A_C_McGregor @IlyasMilyas20 thank you for having me!

@cleslie92 @comicartfest V kind! Thanks
@Aremay I do have a dog! And a battered Volvo...
@Aremay Well there you go!
@retireenjoy @vincecable will read Tonight.
@johnwedgey no. It means I'm careful when it comes to social media and legal issues.
@johnwedgey any evidence should be past to the police asap. I don't think twitter is a good forum to discuss these issues.
@johnwedgey there is a child abuse panel plus police investigations. We need to be careful to not prejudice any inquiry.
@ruralred its up to the public to decide. They elect their MPs and we will see.
@ByrneLan off to have dinner now. Cheers, Tim
@ByrneLan again, you didn't answer my question. I've spent a lot if time on TTIP. I want more info/safeguards re NHS
@trevdick thank you. Really appreciate your support.
@ByrneLan ignoring my question then?
@trevdick thanks :)
@dunkindialectic :) thanks for the chat.
@ByrneLan are you really saying facts are delusion? Seriously?
@dunkindialectic thanks for the chat. Signing off now..off to have dinner.
@dunkindialectic I can't imagine that will change. Just the nature of the beast.
@dunkindialectic I'd argue he has a key role on peoples daily lives.
@ByrneLan and replace it with a NHS ward.
@ByrneLan well I tell them that the H&SC act allowed us to close a private ward at my local hospital.. Set up by labour!
@griffithsian6 thanks :)
@dunkindialectic Id do the same again tomorrow.
@dunkindialectic you might not like the prism. But the point was only us and UKIP actually talked about Europe in a European campaign!
@Loafer7 disagree with that.
@dunkindialectic if Labour or the Tories had wanted to come they could have. They turned up to spin after! I saw them!
@dunkindialectic it was a single issue...Europe! In a European campaign...
@dunkindialectic if no one else is going to have a view in a European election its hard for the BBC et al to do anything else!
@dunkindialectic I disagree with you on nick v Nigel.
@CllrCJHogg @clairethomas1 i agree! Fantastic event and brilliant team!
@SandysClarke @Barclays @NatWestBusiness well said! I hope we can convince them to stay!
@clairethomas1 looking forward to it. On the way!
@SimonOliver42 @LorelyBurt keep up the great work!
@Just_Will_I_am @StockportLibDem was a bit worried for a second :)

@Closey69 totally agree. We need the banks. I will keep fighting hard on this!
@Closey69 also have secured mobile banking but also just secured RBS agreement to keep the ATM.
@Closey69 but I want a branch too! I'm also looking at trying to bring a new bank to town!
@Closey69 I am working on this every day at the moment. Meeting Barclays, RBS and post office in coming days
Fantastic to be at the opening of the new Sedbergh business hub. A great asset for the town. Well done to all involved
@retireenjoy @LibDems will have a look
Many congratulations to @annageorgina being named as the North West's weekly reporter of the year! Very, very well deserved.

@Drew_Mac Just leaving a care home now.  Just been meeting with the staff.
@samdwebber @CumbriaCC Will read - thanks.
@Britunculus look forward to it :)
@ja_bateson @CountryStandard @quakerpen I don't know.
@Puffles2010 @Taw_66 @ACarpenDigital @swhitebread @CllrTimBick thanks. Will have a listen!
@swhitebread @CllrTimBick @Taw_66 really, really well done!
@CllrTimBick @Taw_66 well done to the whole team. Fab result
@joswinson @SianSteans @drlangtry_girl @nick_clegg I concur with Jo.
@Taw_66 congratulations!
Well done to @julianhuppert and the whole Cambridge team on the @LibDems gain in @camcitco Queen Edith's ward by-election! Fab result!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I understand but I feel you are wrong. Let's agree to disagree as its 1130
@oldlefty47 @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband fair point!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I'd just Google it. One of many sources: http://t.co/JD7NScPFlQ
@ja_bateson @CountryStandard @quakerpen look forward to the debates
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 that is one link of many to be fair
@CountryStandard @quakerpen disagree
@holmfirthartist @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I do try. But he needs be held to account on this.
@holmfirthartist @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 well propose it then?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 what clip?
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband thanks :)
@HollyNelson11 very kind. Thanks
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband i do enjoy your sniping...it makes me laugh.
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 he said lets have a 'head to head debate before the general election'
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband oh dear. Hope you are well Liam
@ShafiqmohdMohd no I'm not.
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband we need to make a fairer society.
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I voted against fees
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 http://t.co/t53I6FPi5W
@gilljep @TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film :) thanks
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 he challenged him to a debate.. And then did a uturn
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband yep. Well you've already ran away....brave
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 in a debate....
@gilljep @TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film i try to do that!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 just opened. Yes I am.
@TheGamechanger @gilljep @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film look forward to it!
@ShafiqmohdMohd I voted against fees. Shame many labour MPs didn't have my consistency on the issue
@Cumpedelibero @KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well why challenge then?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 sorry the link isn't opening on my phone what was it sorry?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 it is when you lay down a challenge and then change your mind 1 hour later!
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband on what sense?
@Cumpedelibero @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well yes. But Ed challenged him not me.
@TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband please do email me! :)
@Cumpedelibero @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband he did challenge him to be fair..
@TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I'd be happy to!
@Britunculus sorry forgot to say...hope you are well :)
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband sorry forgot to say...hope you are well :)
@Rosiecosy @KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I voted against fees :)
@jegolton will do :)
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband not sniping. Just the truth.
@DomJBrown @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well he challenged him! Ask him..
@Britunculus sorry to hear that. Happy to chat about it.
@WingyMartin @Philip_Porter I voted against them.
@WingyMartin @HouseofTwitsLib @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband he challenged him not me!
@KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband tell you boss to not do a U turn then Karl. He challenged him...follow though.
@Philip_Porter at least we have the courage of our convictions!
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband course not. But at least we have the courage of our convictions!
@DomJBrown @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband then why challenge him? He chose to do that. Farage accepted and then Miliband changed his mind.
.@nick_clegg put his head above the parapet and debated with Farage. @Ed_Miliband has already chickened out from his own challenge!
@hjones2061 it wasnt an offhand dismissal. You totally misrepresented me.
@hjones2061 you asked me a question if the police had replied.. I said yes. And then actually said pls email me
@hjones2061 again, for clarity. I never said it, thought it or believe it.
@hjones2061 you made a statement of fact which was utterly untrue and said you were reading through the lines...
@WoollyMindedLib @marcfairclough @nick_clegg Not sure that's fair.
@marcfairclough @nick_clegg In my opinion he shouldn't be signed by any club. At all.
@hjones2061 No I didn't say that at all. That is totally and utterly untrue
@hjones2061 The police figures I saw were v low.  If you have any other evidence please do email me at tim.farron@libdems.org.uk
@Yazzy4 @fihowty I do that too on here. Can be hard to type on my mobile. Big fingers and small buttons!
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e if you are - I'd be happy to help in any way I can,
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e I'm sure you said John was your local MP.  Can you DM me your postcode and I will check asap.
@fihowty First I've heard of it was today's paper.  What do you think.  Keen to hear local opinions.
@Mark_ED_Lowe Thank you :)
@Dem_Tilly @MShapland I know!
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e @JustinWelby I'm sure he will in due course.
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e I understand but I am not your local MP or a Conservative. As I said, it's a question for them...
@gillianabennett Will have a look. Thanks
@SeanCoglan That's a question for them really.
@MShapland @Dem_Tilly Not really a formal ball kind of person.  Bit too House of Habsburg for me.
@SeanCoglan With you now. Here is what I said: http://t.co/VrrlWlTmT3
@SeanCoglan What have I asked for Sean?
@iaingill @mshafiquk @LibDemInternat @KishwerFalkner No problem :) Thanks for all you do Iain
@SiButterworth @helen_bradley Thanks :)
@SiButterworth @helen_bradley Sounds good! Do you have a copy?
@2bmay @revbickers Thank you :)
@helen_bradley @SiButterworth Congratulations!
@JRichards95 Good to hear!
@JRichards95 @HuffPostUKPol Thank you Jonathan - how is Newcastle?
@littlealb @RichardWS @LibDemPress @julianhuppert No problem. Hope you are well.
@Geoffrey_M_B Always happy to discuss/debate :)
@Geoffrey_M_B Haha!
@LibDemBen @LibDemCF Thanks so much
@revbickers Thanks
@Geoffrey_M_B Thank you
@mshafiquk I'm good thanks - hope you are too.
@mshafiquk No problem :)
@mshafiquk @LibDemInternat @KishwerFalkner Appears so: https://t.co/4Cs9b1fByy
@ReachEd and my constituency always comes first :)
@ReachEd I try to be led by the evidence and not my faith.
@ReachEd Religion should not have a preferential place.
@ReachEd Of course not :) I would disestablish the church of england
@AntacsB @montie @KatieHarrisonTF There is, quite a lively ongoing academic debate on this. Lots of articles available.
@MJohn59655 PS - Thanks.  Hope you are well.
@MJohn59655 keep at least one branch open
@MJohn59655 Was a bit surprised at that too! His piece was factually wrong too...we have been offered mobile banking! But I want to..
@montie @KatieHarrisonTF Thanks :)
@richbowpitt Thanks
@markrusselluk Please do
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Again, I meant it in terms of if you believe.
@littlealb @RichardWS @LibDemPress @julianhuppert Yes you did - thanks. Have spoken some policy people about it Allan
@markrusselluk Let's chat :)
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Link is here: http://t.co/RjMcUCWGcN
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Please have a read. See what you think.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Im simply saying my faith fires my passion to make a difference.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Im not saying that religious people are the only ones who care about poverty and injustice
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg People might not like it or disagree, that's fine. But it makes me, me.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg part of you.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg How? If you are asked in every interview or it fires your passion or poverty? It's like hiding...
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy That is his choice. So your argument now it's because someone else does things that we should too?
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg that my faith or god doesn't exist. I'm not by the way.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg As I said. No problem with that. But my point is that I could be equally offended by people who..
@markrusselluk @HulbertMathew @nick_clegg Thanks
@KatieHarrisonTF Thank you
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Imagine it was to me...
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy but do I believe, like you do and Alistair Campbell did that people shouldnt 'do god' - no.
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy I'd go further and suggest the disestablishment of the church
@HulbertMathew @nick_clegg I disagree utterly but you are entitled to your opinion.
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy That's your view and a valid viewpoint. I disagree.
@HulbertMathew @nick_clegg It depends on what you believe doesn't it I guess.
@HulbertMathew If you don't then you don't.
@HulbertMathew If you believe....as I said at the top.
@HulbertMathew Where is that in my piece?
@HulbertMathew so I wrote a piece. I explains that my faith makes me passionate about dealing with poverty and injustice.
@HulbertMathew About what? I was asked about my faith and I wrote an article.  I am regularly asked about it in interviews..
@HulbertMathew PS - The piece is nearly a week old - published on the 7th
@MJohn59655 Thank you :)
@HulbertMathew Why do you ask?
@benatom1 where are those figures from? Thanks
@ianeastleeds will read the link. Thanks.
@jembendell will have a look at the links. Thanks.

@guldreyboy I am meeting Sedbergh school on Friday.
@guldreyboy Thanks.  Am speaking to Barclays soon.  Will make sure they see this!
@SeanCoglan Are you saying, honestly, that the ONS is baised? Really?
@Frasmi I agree that we need councils to be let of the leash and to be able to build again.
@Andrew_S_Hatton If you want to send me a longer message - pls email - address is tim.farron@libdems.org.uk
@Andrew_S_Hatton Message heard. Can you not send so many tweets though please.  It's filling my timeline.
@Andrew_S_Hatton @Broadland_Dan I can't talk for other MP's. But I always try to listen to experts. For me it's about outcomes.
@socialistvilla v kind
@SeanCoglan Also... 3rd lowest unemployment in the UK, 3000 apprenticeships and hundreds of millions of investment....
@socialistvilla V kind. We might not always agree but I welcome the discussion.
@socialistvilla I voted against fees.
Since 2010 we have created thousands of apprenticeships - this is something I am incredibly proud of and... http://t.co/netlEAbqGq

@stridingedge as an MP so do I....
@Andrew_S_Hatton @ianeiloart haven't seen the court papers. But will look into it. Happy to chat about this at the event
@ianeiloart looking forward to it!
@stridingedge Blackpool was used by local people. I spoke to one person only today. HS2 is about capacity... And needed.
@stridingedge don't agree with you there. Hope you are well though.
@Cumbrianeuro @NeuroAlliance @CommonsPAC glad to help.
@daysoutinfo @honisterdotcom @stridingedge Re: Rail. I agree.
@daysoutinfo @honisterdotcom @stridingedge I agree. Will keep working with other MP's on this.

@MartyHowes will chase up tomorrow

@adTominem @HuffPostUKPol thank you
@RogerDavies24 thank you for taking the time to see me. I really appreciated it. V helpful.
@sarah_garnett @mrpaulwaring @BigsaiHansen @YLequitte brilliant event as always. Thank you for having us :)

@750VFR short answer is yes. Its something I raise a lot with ministers. VAT should not be applied to MR equipment, defibs or other things
@chrishattoncedr @SteveBroach ah you beat me to it! Happy to look at the detail if you'd like to email me.
@chrishattoncedr @SteveBroach might be wrong but is this something Norman is on with? Or meeting people about?

@ja_bateson @Wren_Alan @MJohn59655 sorry..stepped away. I like John. But he knows he's on a sticky wicket here. But fair play to him..
@leedargue thank you Lee :)
@MJohn59655 @ja_bateson @Wren_Alan yep
@Wren_Alan @ja_bateson ah you beat me to it!
@Wren_Alan and Ive voted against the BT
@Wren_Alan i voted against fees so that is welcome

@NigeTomo65 Thanks.  Will read and act on it asap.
@allanwin Could you email me.  I'm speaking to SLDC in the next few days.
@allanwin Never enough! ;)
@allanwin If I can help in any way please let me know.
@allanwin It is good news but I understand the point. How are you Allan?
@HawksheadGP thx
@allanwin Fair point.
@HawksheadGP Yes. I totally agree. This needs to be factored in.
@NigeTomo65 Thanks. Will act on it asap
@flimbydave @North_Futures No it's both.
@NigeTomo65 Happy to ask the council asap.  Could you email me?
I've welcomed an announcement that £10 million has been secured from the Regional Growth Fund for the development... http://t.co/LkjymZGTAK
@flimbydave @North_Futures I'm sure I have any more confidence in a bigger authority!
@flimbydave @North_Futures Only time will tell..
@flimbydave @North_Futures Cumbria.
@flimbydave @North_Futures Disagree. The Chorley example shows the way I believe.
@flimbydave @North_Futures My view is clear - a unitary Westmorland CC
@flimbydave @North_Futures will look at the agenda.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack If you apply for this short notice application. Thanks - it'd be helpful to know.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Best number for is 01539 723403. More than happy to chat.  Can I check? Will you be taking the 106 back up?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack I'd suggest you contact their comms team asap then. Because they seem incredibly firm on this.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Are the facts I tweeted incorrect?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack They are the facts, I'm told. Are you suggesting they are incorrect>=?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack  Commissioner to register a service.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack services from 3/11 onwards. This was far shorter notice than the normal 56-days required by the Traffic
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack say they only received the application on 13/10 from Reays to register the running of the 105 and 106
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Cumbria CC say that We saw a copy of the registration note on 29/9, but the Traffic Commissioner’s office
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack If those facts are wrong, I'd suggest speaking to Cumbria CC urgently.
@andy_trap1_horn  @CumbriaCrack  I'd be happy to chat face to face with you.  I've been working via Cumbria CC.
@CumbriaCrack Easy! ;)
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack and then walking away.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack No blaming you for the industry. Just not, it appears, filling in the paperwork correctly
@diktwittington fair point
@JamesWilson1413 Thanks
@PoppyBullard Look forward to the debates :)
@sl_carers thanks :)
@EllisButcher not really.
@TheGamechanger @martinlewes @EllisButcher Haha
@martinlewes @EllisButcher ;)
@EllisButcher Thanks
@AndrewNoblet @UKPatchwork @LibDems @KPMG Thank you
@King_Body_Art Thanks
@King_Body_Art I'd speak to your local party and the press office.  At first glance it seems okay to me
@King_Body_Art In what sense?
@Jabwah @eddaveykands I'm going to read the wording first...
@JUMPINTOKENDAL thx
@Jabwah @eddaveykands As I've said to local firefighters - I'll keep making local representations on their behalf.
@Tdw2962Thomas nothing ordinary about the clash!
On train back north dealing with casework while listening to the first Clash album (the US version with Complete Control on it).
@Jabwah @eddaveykands Whats the EDM?
@diktwittington What do you think?
@retireenjoy @UKPatchwork @LibDems @KPMG Thanks
@Gwared_86 Thank you
@JUMPINTOKENDAL @elephantyard @CllrCJHogg :)
@flimbydave Of course.  I regularly mention the Lakes and Furness lines and infrastructure spending in the South Lakes.
@henryadamsUK @GreenLibDems understood - thanks
@pure_Funtasy thx
@henryadamsUK @GreenLibDems What tweet sorry?
@diktwittington Think so yes
@Guanajuatouk Will mention it. Thanks
@caronmlindsay @HulbertMathew i agree.. Right off to bed. Night both.
@HulbertMathew hope you are okay
@Hawkarama I agree and if we could replicate that even a little bit...it would be brilliant
@Hawkarama interesting.. I have no strong opinion on a referendum. I just want to make sure people are really, really engaged.
@Hawkarama i hadn't thought about a vote/referendum. What do you think?
@Hawkarama in what sense sorry?
@Hawkarama I hope these debates continue and they aren't just councillors talking to each other...we need a public discussion IMO
@JasonHolyhead thanks
@Hawkarama it will actually cut costs (by a lot) and allow us to improve services.
@PcNoNonsense v kind. Thanks
@PcNoNonsense I think any extra money for pay/pensions should goto teachers, the police or nurses IMO.
@Hawkarama I think so. I have said I'd like a unitary council based on the old Westmorland County Council
@PcNoNonsense my view is the same as it is about MPs pay. We get enough and its not needed.
@Hawkarama i do make that point to the BBC and the media
@Convalescence2 will watch. Thanks
@Alanjdar66 @CumbriaCrack @RoryStewartUK its a vital lifeline for shoppers, residents and students
@johnroger40 @georgewhutton1 its a lovely photo! :)
@Alanjdar66 @CumbriaCrack @RoryStewartUK yes Reays were supposed to run the route and dropped out. Bad news. We will keep at it.
@cllrdarrenfower thank you :)
@retireenjoy the honest answer is that I doubt it.
@LorelyBurt @GGoodlad @miss_s_b @Linothel @BaronessRos as a real champion for women that is the most absurd thing I've heard in a long time
@GGoodlad @miss_s_b @Linothel @BaronessRos @LorelyBurt what?
@binny_uk @miss_s_b @stealthmunchkin @Linothel @BaronessRos lets call that one plan B... ;)
@miss_s_b @stealthmunchkin @Linothel @BaronessRos :)
@LibbyBateman well the offer is there. Hope you take it up.
@stealthmunchkin @Linothel @miss_s_b @BaronessRos haha!
@LibbyBateman again, for a third time...the offer to work with us is there. Hope you take it up rather than just sending angry tweets.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack if we count a press release as work I guess.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack I have every right as Neil and I have worked on this and we will keep at it. Again, you are welcome to join us.
@binny_uk @miss_s_b well...lots of doors to knock on!
@stealthmunchkin @miss_s_b thank you :)
@miss_s_b @BaronessRos yes its v soon.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack to find a new provider. You are welcome to work with us... Or just keep sending angry tweets.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack Neil Hughes has worked incredibly hard on this. V disappointed that Reays pulled out. We will work..
@miss_s_b @CounsellingMum keep up the good work!
@miss_s_b @CounsellingMum its upto us then to make the case!
@Housing_Justice @NewStatesman thank you
@colingale @nick_clegg @SkyNews As usual I agree with you Colin.  I wrote this yesterday: http://t.co/TixpVsd8X9
@JessOttowell thanks - will do
@GaffneyPaul Thank you :)
@marcfairclough @SianSteans @joswinson Thanks!
@JonMarcStanley Happy to chat about this sometime.  But the short answer is that local elections round here tend to disagree.
@cleslie92 @JoshDixonTweets No problem - v sorry to dash!
@JamesFNewsome @HulbertMathew Yes I do.
@cleslie92 @JoshDixonTweets I'm sorry I have to rush off but please do email me any questions or concerns and I will raise them asap
@cleslie92 It depends and I'm told, it differs from country to country.
@JoshDixonTweets @cleslie92 No that is a fair point.
@cleslie92 There will not be anyone asking for credit cards. Care and help always comes first.
@cleslie92 As I understand it, and it's something I pushed v hard for.  That anyone who needs urgent and emergency care will get it asap
@cleslie92 I will fight them tooth and nail.
@cleslie92 No that's a fair point.
@inducker @NormanBakerMP thx
@cleslie92 I think we might have to agree to disagree. Paying this charge in lieu of paying NI.
@davebrennan50 means working together on friendly terms
@sxybio Thanks Colin
@HulbertMathew Thx
@trevdick @HulbertMathew Thanks :)

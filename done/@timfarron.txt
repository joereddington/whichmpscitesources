@EmmaGreen__ @CumbriaSU I'd re-read what I've actually said. I never said I did it all. I said it was one of my proudest achievements.
@suttonnick have a good weekend Nick.
@ProfTimBale @BBCWorldatOne @suttonnick Have a good weekend.
@ProfTimBale @BBCWorldatOne @suttonnick There goes our friends forever collage...
@_tommylong @DanKellyEsq @chrisccoulson @HulbertMathew New fact of the day! I had no idea.
@mumofjackandsam @ReachEd @trevdick @colingale Thank you
@ReachEd @colingale Thanks. This tweet has made my day.

@ReachEd I don't mind. Always happy to engage!
@willmill82 Oh with you now! Hadn't spotted that!
@HulbertMathew @DanKellyEsq I never ignore you Mat. Always listen and engage.
@HulbertMathew @DanKellyEsq You can always do more and we will keep trying!
South Lakeland Mind have announced that they have raised over Â£50,000!!!

The charity had been facing the threat... http://t.co/83Y0viMJT7
@DanKellyEsq @HulbertMathew Agreed
@HulbertMathew @jon_gleeson Please do email me Mat and I will take any comments you have to the campaigns committee.
@jon_gleeson @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress Well said Jon.
@jamesmaxwell86 Glad to have a chance to clarify then.
@jamesmaxwell86 Was trying to get a slight dig in about the various UKIP wings...not sure it worked.
@jamesmaxwell86 Have a good day!
@jon_gleeson @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress Thanks :)
@LibDemSimon @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews It's both of them - with a good team of Lib Dem ministers.
@HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews Imagine Nick is running the country!
@jrfearnley @HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews We should comment. We shouldn't be empty chaired IMO.
@colingale @jamesrobking Thanks both. I concur about EU reform proposals!
@HulbertMathew @LibDemPress @BBCNews They are just doing their job.
@jamesmaxwell86 Happy to - UKIP.
@timprater @LibDemPress @BBCNews Thanks Tim.

@SamButler2805 @BBCRadio4 Thanks.
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems @itvnews @nick_clegg What else would you like me to do?
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems @itvnews @nick_clegg Our policy is there- and is clear. I've said my view A LOT.
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems The members have spoken. We have passed policy on fees.
@libdemsteve1 thx
@BhaavinPurohit @trevdick @LibDems My views on this are well known.
@libdemsteve1 Pls do email me.
@carollowe98 Yes

@suzykenyo Hi Suzy, I'm meeting Vince sadly not in Westminster to talk about TTIP and other issues
@carollowe98 In London today and then train up
@kendalgiant I disagree with him on global warming.  I think the evidence is overwhelming.
@JRfromStrickley No problem.
@JRfromStrickley It's a vital issue and delighted to support :)
@JRfromStrickley No problem - hope you are well.
@jerijerod14 :)
@JustinWalkerBCG @stevebeasant We disagree on this.
@JRfromStrickley @NewHutton I've RT'd :)
@jackdavies4317 @LibDemConf @LibDems @GoodallGiles @nick_clegg @ArfanBhatti1 @lfeatherstone agreed :)
@jerijerod14 sorry I missed you too!
@whysomanypeople @RoryStewartUK think you are wrong there. Hope you are well though.
@whysomanypeople @RoryStewartUK not sure I agree with that.

@CllrMcAuley will keep an eye out for the result!
@CllrMcAuley how do you think its gone?
@markhughes @libdemvoice we are not going to agree on this...
@KristinaML90 @LibDems thank you :)
@markhughes @libdemvoice have you googled my view on fracking?
@SportiveLakes @kayaburgess @JWoodcockMP will read. Thanks.
@EmilyTesterLD its a brilliant fact
@EmilyTesterLD that's my new fact of the day!
@WheelhouseGS what is this scheme?
@WheelhouseGS what issue in particular? I try and raise lots of issues :)
@pastieman69 sorry to hear that.
@pastieman69 I was offering to make representations on your behalf to do my job.
@pastieman69 I am doing my job. I'm meeting a cabinet minister to discuss an issue that concerns many constituents.
@pastieman69 I'd be happy to make representations on your behalf to tim@timfarron.co.UK and I will do that asap.
@pastieman69 I have raised issues from the bill with ministers already and will do so again.
@pastieman69 I'm actually meeting Vince to talk TTIP and other issues but he's not in Westminster so I won't be either.
@sjharte I have tried to listen, learn and engage as any good liberal should do :)
@BazPos It will come out of the aid budget. Good news.
@JessOttowell I agree - @Kirsty_Williams, @ElunedParrottAM and the team are doing great things on this. V supportive on their work.
@JessOttowell :) Thanks
On #transdayofremembrance we honour the victims of transphobic violence and continue to fight intolerance -  one step at a time.
@KendalFruitCake @Neil_GPmag @SuzanneEvans1 Obviously I'm saying there is no reason for MP *NOT* to pay this 2nd homes tax - they should.
@Neil_GPmag @SuzanneEvans1 @KendalFruitCake Wonder if Suzanne will re-tweet that? ;)
@JamesWorron I recently did the Beveridge lecture which you can find here: http://t.co/DcZl22ps5u
@SailormanIan https://t.co/YAZ94rZug0
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale :D
@powellds Thanks for this.
@Kav_Kaushik @Martin_Veart @GrahamNeale Well thank you very much :) Very kind.
@Kav_Kaushik @Martin_Veart @GrahamNeale Dont think so! It was in the Indy a while ago!
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale Honest answer is that I don't.
UK giving Â£720m to intl #climate fund is welcome news. Beveridge liberals know that tackling climate is the biggest new 'ill' we face
@Martin_Veart @Kav_Kaushik @GrahamNeale I am yes.
@matt_tennant Or @HeidiHalliday has said she'd like to see health services in there.
@matt_tennant Yes - I'd like to see green tech start up businesses in there.
@wildwomanswims1 Voted for the bill and against parts.
@paulcotswolds Keep up the good work Paul
@McFarlandFraser Dont see why not.

@colingale @nick_clegg It's more about party morale rather than actually the issues of the day.
@BenForRSN @tes :) Thanks Ben
@APFaz I support HS2.
@MJohn59655 Yes I have said that in my comment which can be found here: http://t.co/tDuyKvmGIf

GOOD NEWS! Premier Inn has pulled out of plans to open a Â£5 million hotel at a specific building in Ambleside.

@Jongriffiths14 I haven't signed the EDM but have made many representations on behalf of local ff to ministers. Will keep doing so.
@HarisonPlant @UKinUkraine me too. We need to follow that up with more action too...
@miketmullaney @scottishliberal I'm proud to be supporting your campaign!
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal sorry just thought I should cite my sources!
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal government.
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal  website as saying that Tredinnick is "perhaps the worst example of scientific illiteracy in
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal quote in full: Elizabeth Gibney inTimes Higher EducationÂ quoted the Skeptical Voter
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal I hope so. We need you. I have had enough of his scientific illiteracy.
@shugwud @FutureAmbleside @HeidiHalliday thank you :)
@miketmullaney @HulbertMathew @scottishliberal you are doing a brilliant job!
@HappyMaverick @DrJennyWoods sounds good!
@HulbertMathew @scottishliberal @miketmullaney he will be a brilliant MP. We need him in Westminster.
@HulbertMathew @scottishliberal @willmill82 well said!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 very fair point!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 glad to help!
@scottishliberal @willmill82 its good news :)
@scottishliberal If I can help in any way please let me know.
@scottishliberal need more time in the day or a twin! How's being a PPC?
@scottishliberal well said! How are you?
@MR_JustinTaylor nice to see you!
@HappyMaverick @Matt_Severn @LibDems as soon as they all selected!
@HappyMaverick @Matt_Severn @LibDems we won't soon!
@henryadamsUK Thanks - will look later.  Signing off twitter for a bit. Thanks for the link.
Congratulations to @Matt_Severn for being selected as the @LibDems Parliamentary Candidate for #Morecambe & #Lunesdale
@brianjcapstick Granted. Totally fair point and I hopefully just said that in my other tweet :)
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk But we can do better and I will keep doing all I can to help them!
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk But many towns like Sedbergh, Bowness and Ambleside to name but 3 are doing amazingly too.
@750VFR or give me a call on 01539 723403 or pop along to a surgery. Happy to help in any way I can
@750VFR But the ASDA/Morrisons ones are in the cafe so not really appropriate for very personal issues.  If can help pls email me
@henryadamsUK Will read tonight. Thanks
@brianjcapstick But I meant as in big town...if that classification exists!
@brianjcapstick @gazettenewsdesk Well quite a lot of stats! Investment, unemployment figures, apprenticeships to name three
@750VFR I'd argue that 2nd home owners need those services too when they stay in their properties. They need a bus or a Post Office.
@750VFR Usually in private - I have a staff member there who has signed a confidentially agreement
@henryadamsUK Happy to,
@samdwebber @SimonHughesMP Glad to help!
@henryadamsUK Hi Henry, I'm sorry I can't attend.  I'm at events all day Thursday.
@samdwebber @SimonHughesMP RT'd ;)
@Bobby_Dean Look forward to seeing you again! Let's have another chat.  Be good to catch up!
@Bobby_Dean Yes it is! Hope to see you there?
@Bobby_Dean :) Hope so!
@750VFR It's both actually.  But it's also things like seasonality too being a tourist area,
@HeidiHalliday Two wins in two days! Well done.
@oldlefty47 Happy to deliver any message to him :)
@oldlefty47 I'm actually at a meeting this Friday not in Westminster talking to Vince about TTIP amongst other things.
@_tommylong Thanks - will read :)
@_tommylong Do you have a link?
WE WON! http://t.co/RhH0ailc5C Well done @FutureAmbleside & @HeidiHalliday - Great news!
@EllisButcher @npdkendal Brilliant news! We won!
@Bobby_Dean @HuffPostUK Thanks Bobby. Hope you are well!
@TeamGabalfa @ElunedParrottAM Seconded.
@29leeFinch Thanks Lee :)
@patrickhaveron Thank you :)
@syki264 I agree I try to listen to the experts in areas like this.
@syki264 I have asked for that information.
@Andrew_S_Hatton I try and deal with urgent emails first - homeless people etc try and deal with policy questions asap.
@syki264 Seems a bit bonkers to me! Surely there is a sensible middle way. What do you think?
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio Thanks - will read it tonight on the train!
@rorymeakin make the communities that 2nd homes owners use. PS they also get a discount on CT.
@rorymeakin It's mixed.  Services used in summer -heavily then less so in the rest of the year. But these services like PO, Pubs etc
@1992Higgin v kind.
@rorymeakin ...GP surgeries have little demand? In the Lake District? Really?
@PaulHindley2210 Thanks Paul -appreciate it!
@andrewgill1984 Thank you :)
@juliacambridge1 @HulbertMathew Thank you both.
@HulbertMathew :)

@juliacambridge1 Thanks Julia - more info here: http://t.co/CpgNAxSTPM
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio I am! Keen to do more so any ideas are very welcome.
@guy_levin @taavet @alexmstephany @Luvaglio Really good column and it's great to see startups getting political.
These Mark Reckless comments show UKIPâs true colours. Reckless and UKIP have not been misunderstood, they have been found out.
@NorthSouthApp @HuffPostUK Thanks - will do.
@lauradavies24 @MissLauraMarcus V kind :)
@lauradavies24 @MissLauraMarcus I try to be! :) I think if people take the time to get in touch...I NEED to reply.
Well done @Kirsty_Williams -Welsh Liberal Democrats to hold Assembly debate on Transgender awareness http://t.co/WVDAZQ30vr via @libdemvoice
@cleslie92 I like her a lot too. Very impressive..
@cleslie92 I agree. I though Ruth & Willie's were v good... Some less so...
@H_Bettsworth please let me know how it goes!
@H_Bettsworth have my fingers and toes crossed for you!
@H_Bettsworth looks great!
@H_Bettsworth what are you applying for?
@H_Bettsworth just working! Glad its going well :)
@H_Bettsworth hope Spain is going well :)
@lfeatherstone @IainDale is a good journalist but more than that he's a decent & lovely man. Even though we don't always agree politically!
@jpfuller74 I believe it is needed. Teaching is a profession and should be treated as such.
@dandoj @jameswesthead thanks :)
@jpfuller74 I hope it will be different this time
@Drew_Peacock123 @Wren_Alan haha!
@chezmacc thank you so much :)
@Wren_Alan Is it? ;) I've honestly not been following it!
@750VFR @BazPos :)
@750VFR @BazPos I do answer emails/work on a Sunday but I'm at home so not really 'working' if you know what I mean
@chezmacc I have been doing a lot on this in the last few weeks. Could you email me?
@BazPos @750VFR you need to do both IMO.
@750VFR @BazPos meet on a Saturday... I do ask..a lot!
@750VFR @BazPos I work 6 days a week. I sometimes need to be in Kendal as many people (usually public sector) won't come to London or
@BazPos I won't be in London on Friday sadly as I have a set of meetings that I can't move. Have tried to raise issues though
@PETRIEDESIGN @GeorgeMonbiot Thanks for your thoughts :)
@GlynLey Interesting point.  In other parties you become a SpAD then into a safe seat.
@PETRIEDESIGN @GeorgeMonbiot Will read - thanks.
@BazPos :)
@BelindaBG The problems with linking your facebook page to your twitter! :)
This morning I've welcomed the news that Cumbria county council has axed the plan to bring in on street car... http://t.co/6n87QEefpV
@DanSilverSARF @tomslater42 @djmgaffneyw4 I treat everything I'm told with a dose of skepticism. ;)
@tomslater42 @DanSilverSARF @djmgaffneyw4 Following both now - thanks
@newapproach_UK @Mylegalforum will read. Thanks.
@pastieman69 I want to close this off asap
@pastieman69 I haven't had chance to speak to the council yet. But the PR read to me as they have left their options open.
@tomslater42 just because I speak/listen to the CSJ as well as other orgs on the left and in the centre too? I'd call that sensible!
@pastieman69 and Simon Thomas. I played a supporting role. They deserve the credit.
@pastieman69 morning Mike. I did a lot of lobbying over many months on this but the praise should GOTO people like Bill Smith and
@Sed_Sedgwick but thank you :)
@Sed_Sedgwick I met Sedbergh School on Friday. Don't think I'm meeting them again for a little bit.
@jacqc1 @Tubby_Isaacs @csjthinktank thanks. Appreciate the link.
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank have a good evening :)
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank we are not going to agree on this. Sorry!
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank do I always agree with them - no. Are they a force for good in the debate - without a shadow of a doubt
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank I look at lots of evidence and speak to lots of experts. I think the CSJ do great work in poverty issues
@Tubby_Isaacs @jacqc1 @csjthinktank A good idea is a good idea no matter where it come from.
@JamesTitcombe @masters_nik @ShaunLintern @JackieDanielNHS I have a lot of confidence in Jackie personally and her wider management team.
@masters_nik @ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP I'm not sure a system changes automatically.. But understand your argument.
@retireenjoy imagine its on war on wants website.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP fair point.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP actually praise them if they do well.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP really? That's not on. This information should be public. Only way we hold them to account and..
@jacqc1 @csjthinktank I will watch the programme first...
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP I was eventually sent the report. The media got it first.
@ShaunLintern @JamesTitcombe @JWoodcockMP that's what I was saying.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP To me it shows how we must change the culture and how hard that is to change.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP UHMBT has made bug strides forward but we must remember that the inquiry is ongoing.
@JamesTitcombe @ShaunLintern @JWoodcockMP looks like it been changed. Not omission.
@BazPos @JWoodcockMP will have a read - thanks.
@AMcGAshington @LibDems thanks!
@gmbutts @JustinTrudeau @VoteCelina sorry yes. Will keep my eye out for the result!
@gmbutts @JustinTrudeau @VoteCelina is the election today?
@brownrachel1 have followed you. Hope it works now :)
@brownrachel1 thank you :)
@brownrachel1 @Brakecharity do we have any Cumbrian figures on this?
@HulbertMathew @LibDems thanks
@retireenjoy we need to see the detail. I get LOTS and LOTS of emails/tweets like this. More info here: https://t.co/UhMXo4WxQm
@TheBagfish @miss_s_b @Calderdale_LD v kind of them to invite me along. :)
@csjthinktank thank you :)
@csjthinktank I'm on a train so will try and watch on 4OD. But do you have the research behind the show?
@A_C_McGregor @miss_s_b @samphripp no problem. Glad to come!
@miss_s_b @samphripp v kind. Thanks.
@miss_s_b @samphripp thank you for having me :)

@cleslie92 @comicartfest V kind! Thanks
@Aremay I do have a dog! And a battered Volvo...
@Aremay Well there you go!
@retireenjoy @vincecable will read Tonight.
@johnwedgey no. It means I'm careful when it comes to social media and legal issues.
@johnwedgey any evidence should be past to the police asap. I don't think twitter is a good forum to discuss these issues.
@johnwedgey there is a child abuse panel plus police investigations. We need to be careful to not prejudice any inquiry.
@ruralred its up to the public to decide. They elect their MPs and we will see.
@ByrneLan off to have dinner now. Cheers, Tim
@ByrneLan again, you didn't answer my question. I've spent a lot if time on TTIP. I want more info/safeguards re NHS
@trevdick thank you. Really appreciate your support.
@ByrneLan ignoring my question then?
@trevdick thanks :)
@dunkindialectic :) thanks for the chat.
@ByrneLan are you really saying facts are delusion? Seriously?
@dunkindialectic thanks for the chat. Signing off now..off to have dinner.
@dunkindialectic I can't imagine that will change. Just the nature of the beast.
@dunkindialectic I'd argue he has a key role on peoples daily lives.
@ByrneLan and replace it with a NHS ward.
@ByrneLan well I tell them that the H&SC act allowed us to close a private ward at my local hospital.. Set up by labour!
@griffithsian6 thanks :)
@dunkindialectic Id do the same again tomorrow.
@dunkindialectic you might not like the prism. But the point was only us and UKIP actually talked about Europe in a European campaign!
@Loafer7 disagree with that.
@dunkindialectic if Labour or the Tories had wanted to come they could have. They turned up to spin after! I saw them!
@dunkindialectic it was a single issue...Europe! In a European campaign...
@dunkindialectic if no one else is going to have a view in a European election its hard for the BBC et al to do anything else!
@dunkindialectic I disagree with you on nick v Nigel.
@CllrCJHogg @clairethomas1 i agree! Fantastic event and brilliant team!
@SandysClarke @Barclays @NatWestBusiness well said! I hope we can convince them to stay!
@clairethomas1 looking forward to it. On the way!
@SimonOliver42 @LorelyBurt keep up the great work!

@Closey69 totally agree. We need the banks. I will keep fighting hard on this!
@Closey69 also have secured mobile banking but also just secured RBS agreement to keep the ATM.
@Closey69 but I want a branch too! I'm also looking at trying to bring a new bank to town!
@Closey69 I am working on this every day at the moment. Meeting Barclays, RBS and post office in coming days
Fantastic to be at the opening of the new Sedbergh business hub. A great asset for the town. Well done to all involved
@retireenjoy @LibDems will have a look
Many congratulations to @annageorgina being named as the North West's weekly reporter of the year! Very, very well deserved.

@Drew_Mac Just leaving a care home now.  Just been meeting with the staff.
@samdwebber @CumbriaCC Will read - thanks.
@Britunculus look forward to it :)
@ja_bateson @CountryStandard @quakerpen I don't know.
@Puffles2010 @Taw_66 @ACarpenDigital @swhitebread @CllrTimBick thanks. Will have a listen!
@swhitebread @CllrTimBick @Taw_66 really, really well done!
@CllrTimBick @Taw_66 well done to the whole team. Fab result
@joswinson @SianSteans @drlangtry_girl @nick_clegg I concur with Jo.
@Taw_66 congratulations!
Well done to @julianhuppert and the whole Cambridge team on the @LibDems gain in @camcitco Queen Edith's ward by-election! Fab result!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I understand but I feel you are wrong. Let's agree to disagree as its 1130
@oldlefty47 @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband fair point!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I'd just Google it. One of many sources: http://t.co/JD7NScPFlQ
@ja_bateson @CountryStandard @quakerpen look forward to the debates
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 that is one link of many to be fair
@CountryStandard @quakerpen disagree
@holmfirthartist @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 I do try. But he needs be held to account on this.
@holmfirthartist @quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 well propose it then?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 what clip?
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband thanks :)
@HollyNelson11 very kind. Thanks
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband i do enjoy your sniping...it makes me laugh.
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 he said lets have a 'head to head debate before the general election'
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband oh dear. Hope you are well Liam
@ShafiqmohdMohd no I'm not.
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband we need to make a fairer society.
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I voted against fees
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 http://t.co/t53I6FPi5W
@gilljep @TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film :) thanks
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 he challenged him to a debate.. And then did a uturn
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband yep. Well you've already ran away....brave
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 in a debate....
@gilljep @TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film i try to do that!
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 just opened. Yes I am.
@TheGamechanger @gilljep @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @screen3film look forward to it!
@ShafiqmohdMohd I voted against fees. Shame many labour MPs didn't have my consistency on the issue
@Cumpedelibero @KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well why challenge then?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 sorry the link isn't opening on my phone what was it sorry?
@quakerpen @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband @oldlefty47 it is when you lay down a challenge and then change your mind 1 hour later!
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband on what sense?
@Cumpedelibero @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well yes. But Ed challenged him not me.
@TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband please do email me! :)
@Cumpedelibero @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband he did challenge him to be fair..
@TheGamechanger @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I'd be happy to!
@Britunculus sorry forgot to say...hope you are well :)
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband sorry forgot to say...hope you are well :)
@Rosiecosy @KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband I voted against fees :)
@jegolton will do :)
@oldlefty47 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband not sniping. Just the truth.
@DomJBrown @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband well he challenged him! Ask him..
@Britunculus sorry to hear that. Happy to chat about it.
@WingyMartin @Philip_Porter I voted against them.
@WingyMartin @HouseofTwitsLib @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband he challenged him not me!
@KarlTurnerMP @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband tell you boss to not do a U turn then Karl. He challenged him...follow though.
@Philip_Porter at least we have the courage of our convictions!
@LiamLavery1 @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband course not. But at least we have the courage of our convictions!
@DomJBrown @nick_clegg @Ed_Miliband then why challenge him? He chose to do that. Farage accepted and then Miliband changed his mind.
.@nick_clegg put his head above the parapet and debated with Farage. @Ed_Miliband has already chickened out from his own challenge!
@hjones2061 it wasnt an offhand dismissal. You totally misrepresented me.
@hjones2061 you asked me a question if the police had replied.. I said yes. And then actually said pls email me
@hjones2061 again, for clarity. I never said it, thought it or believe it.
@hjones2061 you made a statement of fact which was utterly untrue and said you were reading through the lines...
@WoollyMindedLib @marcfairclough @nick_clegg Not sure that's fair.
@marcfairclough @nick_clegg In my opinion he shouldn't be signed by any club. At all.
@hjones2061 No I didn't say that at all. That is totally and utterly untrue
@hjones2061 The police figures I saw were v low.  If you have any other evidence please do email me at tim.farron@libdems.org.uk
@Yazzy4 @fihowty I do that too on here. Can be hard to type on my mobile. Big fingers and small buttons!
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e if you are - I'd be happy to help in any way I can,
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e I'm sure you said John was your local MP.  Can you DM me your postcode and I will check asap.
@fihowty First I've heard of it was today's paper.  What do you think.  Keen to hear local opinions.
@Mark_ED_Lowe Thank you :)
@Dem_Tilly @MShapland I know!
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e @JustinWelby I'm sure he will in due course.
@SeanCoglan @c_of_e I understand but I am not your local MP or a Conservative. As I said, it's a question for them...
@gillianabennett Will have a look. Thanks
@SeanCoglan That's a question for them really.
@MShapland @Dem_Tilly Not really a formal ball kind of person.  Bit too House of Habsburg for me.
@SeanCoglan With you now. Here is what I said: http://t.co/VrrlWlTmT3
@SeanCoglan What have I asked for Sean?
@iaingill @mshafiquk @LibDemInternat @KishwerFalkner No problem :) Thanks for all you do Iain
@SiButterworth @helen_bradley Thanks :)
@SiButterworth @helen_bradley Sounds good! Do you have a copy?
@2bmay @revbickers Thank you :)
@helen_bradley @SiButterworth Congratulations!
@JRichards95 Good to hear!
@JRichards95 @HuffPostUKPol Thank you Jonathan - how is Newcastle?
@littlealb @RichardWS @LibDemPress @julianhuppert No problem. Hope you are well.
@Geoffrey_M_B Always happy to discuss/debate :)
@Geoffrey_M_B Haha!
@LibDemBen @LibDemCF Thanks so much
@revbickers Thanks
@Geoffrey_M_B Thank you
@mshafiquk I'm good thanks - hope you are too.
@mshafiquk No problem :)
@mshafiquk @LibDemInternat @KishwerFalkner Appears so: https://t.co/4Cs9b1fByy
@ReachEd and my constituency always comes first :)
@ReachEd I try to be led by the evidence and not my faith.
@ReachEd Religion should not have a preferential place.
@ReachEd Of course not :) I would disestablish the church of england
@AntacsB @montie @KatieHarrisonTF There is, quite a lively ongoing academic debate on this. Lots of articles available.
@MJohn59655 PS - Thanks.  Hope you are well.
@MJohn59655 keep at least one branch open
@MJohn59655 Was a bit surprised at that too! His piece was factually wrong too...we have been offered mobile banking! But I want to..
@montie @KatieHarrisonTF Thanks :)
@richbowpitt Thanks
@markrusselluk Please do
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Again, I meant it in terms of if you believe.
@littlealb @RichardWS @LibDemPress @julianhuppert Yes you did - thanks. Have spoken some policy people about it Allan
@markrusselluk Let's chat :)
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Link is here: http://t.co/RjMcUCWGcN
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Please have a read. See what you think.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Im simply saying my faith fires my passion to make a difference.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg Im not saying that religious people are the only ones who care about poverty and injustice
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg People might not like it or disagree, that's fine. But it makes me, me.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg part of you.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg How? If you are asked in every interview or it fires your passion or poverty? It's like hiding...
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy That is his choice. So your argument now it's because someone else does things that we should too?
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg that my faith or god doesn't exist. I'm not by the way.
@HulbertMathew @markrusselluk @nick_clegg As I said. No problem with that. But my point is that I could be equally offended by people who..
@markrusselluk @HulbertMathew @nick_clegg Thanks
@KatieHarrisonTF Thank you
@Rosiecosy @HulbertMathew Imagine it was to me...
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy but do I believe, like you do and Alistair Campbell did that people shouldnt 'do god' - no.
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy I'd go further and suggest the disestablishment of the church
@HulbertMathew @nick_clegg I disagree utterly but you are entitled to your opinion.
@HulbertMathew @Rosiecosy That's your view and a valid viewpoint. I disagree.
@HulbertMathew @nick_clegg It depends on what you believe doesn't it I guess.
@HulbertMathew If you don't then you don't.
@HulbertMathew If you believe....as I said at the top.
@HulbertMathew Where is that in my piece?
@HulbertMathew so I wrote a piece. I explains that my faith makes me passionate about dealing with poverty and injustice.
@HulbertMathew About what? I was asked about my faith and I wrote an article.  I am regularly asked about it in interviews..
@HulbertMathew PS - The piece is nearly a week old - published on the 7th
@MJohn59655 Thank you :)
@HulbertMathew Why do you ask?
@benatom1 where are those figures from? Thanks
@ianeastleeds will read the link. Thanks.
@jembendell will have a look at the links. Thanks.

@guldreyboy I am meeting Sedbergh school on Friday.
@guldreyboy Thanks.  Am speaking to Barclays soon.  Will make sure they see this!
@SeanCoglan Are you saying, honestly, that the ONS is baised? Really?
@Frasmi I agree that we need councils to be let of the leash and to be able to build again.
@Andrew_S_Hatton If you want to send me a longer message - pls email - address is tim.farron@libdems.org.uk
@Andrew_S_Hatton Message heard. Can you not send so many tweets though please.  It's filling my timeline.
@Andrew_S_Hatton @Broadland_Dan I can't talk for other MP's. But I always try to listen to experts. For me it's about outcomes.
@socialistvilla v kind
@SeanCoglan Also... 3rd lowest unemployment in the UK, 3000 apprenticeships and hundreds of millions of investment....
@socialistvilla V kind. We might not always agree but I welcome the discussion.
@socialistvilla I voted against fees.

@stridingedge as an MP so do I....
@Andrew_S_Hatton @ianeiloart haven't seen the court papers. But will look into it. Happy to chat about this at the event
@ianeiloart looking forward to it!
@stridingedge Blackpool was used by local people. I spoke to one person only today. HS2 is about capacity... And needed.
@stridingedge don't agree with you there. Hope you are well though.
@Cumbrianeuro @NeuroAlliance @CommonsPAC glad to help.
@daysoutinfo @honisterdotcom @stridingedge Re: Rail. I agree.
@daysoutinfo @honisterdotcom @stridingedge I agree. Will keep working with other MP's on this.

@MartyHowes will chase up tomorrow

@adTominem @HuffPostUKPol thank you
@RogerDavies24 thank you for taking the time to see me. I really appreciated it. V helpful.
@sarah_garnett @mrpaulwaring @BigsaiHansen @YLequitte brilliant event as always. Thank you for having us :)

@750VFR short answer is yes. Its something I raise a lot with ministers. VAT should not be applied to MR equipment, defibs or other things
@chrishattoncedr @SteveBroach ah you beat me to it! Happy to look at the detail if you'd like to email me.
@chrishattoncedr @SteveBroach might be wrong but is this something Norman is on with? Or meeting people about?

@leedargue thank you Lee :)
@MJohn59655 @ja_bateson @Wren_Alan yep
@Wren_Alan @ja_bateson ah you beat me to it!
@Wren_Alan and Ive voted against the BT
@Wren_Alan i voted against fees so that is welcome

@NigeTomo65 Thanks.  Will read and act on it asap.
@allanwin Could you email me.  I'm speaking to SLDC in the next few days.
@allanwin Never enough! ;)
@allanwin If I can help in any way please let me know.
@allanwin It is good news but I understand the point. How are you Allan?
@HawksheadGP thx
@allanwin Fair point.
@HawksheadGP Yes. I totally agree. This needs to be factored in.
@NigeTomo65 Thanks. Will act on it asap
@flimbydave @North_Futures No it's both.
@NigeTomo65 Happy to ask the council asap.  Could you email me?
I've welcomed an announcement that Â£10 million has been secured from the Regional Growth Fund for the development... http://t.co/LkjymZGTAK
@flimbydave @North_Futures I'm sure I have any more confidence in a bigger authority!
@flimbydave @North_Futures Only time will tell..
@flimbydave @North_Futures Cumbria.
@flimbydave @North_Futures Disagree. The Chorley example shows the way I believe.
@flimbydave @North_Futures My view is clear - a unitary Westmorland CC
@flimbydave @North_Futures will look at the agenda.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack If you apply for this short notice application. Thanks - it'd be helpful to know.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Best number for is 01539 723403. More than happy to chat.  Can I check? Will you be taking the 106 back up?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack I'd suggest you contact their comms team asap then. Because they seem incredibly firm on this.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Are the facts I tweeted incorrect?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack They are the facts, I'm told. Are you suggesting they are incorrect>=?
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack  Commissioner to register a service.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack services from 3/11 onwards. This was far shorter notice than the normal 56-days required by the Traffic
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack say they only received the application on 13/10 from Reays to register the running of the 105 and 106
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack Cumbria CC say that We saw a copy of the registration note on 29/9, but the Traffic Commissionerâs office
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack If those facts are wrong, I'd suggest speaking to Cumbria CC urgently.
@andy_trap1_horn  @CumbriaCrack  I'd be happy to chat face to face with you.  I've been working via Cumbria CC.
@CumbriaCrack Easy! ;)
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack and then walking away.
@andy_trap1_horn @CumbriaCrack No blaming you for the industry. Just not, it appears, filling in the paperwork correctly
@diktwittington fair point
@JamesWilson1413 Thanks
@PoppyBullard Look forward to the debates :)
@sl_carers thanks :)
@EllisButcher not really.
@TheGamechanger @martinlewes @EllisButcher Haha
@martinlewes @EllisButcher ;)
@EllisButcher Thanks
@AndrewNoblet @UKPatchwork @LibDems @KPMG Thank you
@King_Body_Art Thanks
@King_Body_Art I'd speak to your local party and the press office.  At first glance it seems okay to me
@King_Body_Art In what sense?
@Jabwah @eddaveykands I'm going to read the wording first...
@JUMPINTOKENDAL thx
@Jabwah @eddaveykands As I've said to local firefighters - I'll keep making local representations on their behalf.
@Tdw2962Thomas nothing ordinary about the clash!
On train back north dealing with casework while listening to the first Clash album (the US version with Complete Control on it).
@Jabwah @eddaveykands Whats the EDM?
@diktwittington What do you think?
@retireenjoy @UKPatchwork @LibDems @KPMG Thanks
@Gwared_86 Thank you
@JUMPINTOKENDAL @elephantyard @CllrCJHogg :)
@flimbydave Of course.  I regularly mention the Lakes and Furness lines and infrastructure spending in the South Lakes.
@henryadamsUK @GreenLibDems understood - thanks
@pure_Funtasy thx
@henryadamsUK @GreenLibDems What tweet sorry?
@diktwittington Think so yes
@Guanajuatouk Will mention it. Thanks
@caronmlindsay @HulbertMathew i agree.. Right off to bed. Night both.
@HulbertMathew hope you are okay
@Hawkarama I agree and if we could replicate that even a little bit...it would be brilliant
@Hawkarama interesting.. I have no strong opinion on a referendum. I just want to make sure people are really, really engaged.
@Hawkarama i hadn't thought about a vote/referendum. What do you think?
@Hawkarama in what sense sorry?
@Hawkarama I hope these debates continue and they aren't just councillors talking to each other...we need a public discussion IMO
@JasonHolyhead thanks
@Hawkarama it will actually cut costs (by a lot) and allow us to improve services.
@PcNoNonsense v kind. Thanks
@PcNoNonsense I think any extra money for pay/pensions should goto teachers, the police or nurses IMO.
@Hawkarama I think so. I have said I'd like a unitary council based on the old Westmorland County Council
@PcNoNonsense my view is the same as it is about MPs pay. We get enough and its not needed.
@Hawkarama i do make that point to the BBC and the media
@Convalescence2 will watch. Thanks
@Alanjdar66 @CumbriaCrack @RoryStewartUK its a vital lifeline for shoppers, residents and students
@johnroger40 @georgewhutton1 its a lovely photo! :)
@Alanjdar66 @CumbriaCrack @RoryStewartUK yes Reays were supposed to run the route and dropped out. Bad news. We will keep at it.
@cllrdarrenfower thank you :)
@retireenjoy the honest answer is that I doubt it.
@LorelyBurt @GGoodlad @miss_s_b @Linothel @BaronessRos as a real champion for women that is the most absurd thing I've heard in a long time
@GGoodlad @miss_s_b @Linothel @BaronessRos @LorelyBurt what?
@binny_uk @miss_s_b @stealthmunchkin @Linothel @BaronessRos lets call that one plan B... ;)
@miss_s_b @stealthmunchkin @Linothel @BaronessRos :)
@LibbyBateman well the offer is there. Hope you take it up.
@stealthmunchkin @Linothel @miss_s_b @BaronessRos haha!
@LibbyBateman again, for a third time...the offer to work with us is there. Hope you take it up rather than just sending angry tweets.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack if we count a press release as work I guess.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack I have every right as Neil and I have worked on this and we will keep at it. Again, you are welcome to join us.
@binny_uk @miss_s_b well...lots of doors to knock on!
@stealthmunchkin @miss_s_b thank you :)
@miss_s_b @BaronessRos yes its v soon.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack to find a new provider. You are welcome to work with us... Or just keep sending angry tweets.
@LibbyBateman @CumbriaCrack Neil Hughes has worked incredibly hard on this. V disappointed that Reays pulled out. We will work..
@miss_s_b @CounsellingMum keep up the good work!
@miss_s_b @CounsellingMum its upto us then to make the case!
@Housing_Justice @NewStatesman thank you
@colingale @nick_clegg @SkyNews As usual I agree with you Colin.  I wrote this yesterday: http://t.co/TixpVsd8X9
@JessOttowell thanks - will do
@GaffneyPaul Thank you :)
@marcfairclough @SianSteans @joswinson Thanks!
@JonMarcStanley Happy to chat about this sometime.  But the short answer is that local elections round here tend to disagree.
@cleslie92 @JoshDixonTweets No problem - v sorry to dash!
@JamesFNewsome @HulbertMathew Yes I do.
@cleslie92 @JoshDixonTweets I'm sorry I have to rush off but please do email me any questions or concerns and I will raise them asap
@cleslie92 It depends and I'm told, it differs from country to country.
@JoshDixonTweets @cleslie92 No that is a fair point.
@cleslie92 There will not be anyone asking for credit cards. Care and help always comes first.
@cleslie92 As I understand it, and it's something I pushed v hard for.  That anyone who needs urgent and emergency care will get it asap
@cleslie92 I will fight them tooth and nail.
@cleslie92 No that's a fair point.
@inducker @NormanBakerMP thx
@cleslie92 I think we might have to agree to disagree. Paying this charge in lieu of paying NI.
@davebrennan50 means working together on friendly terms
@sxybio Thanks Colin
@HulbertMathew Thx
@trevdick @HulbertMathew Thanks :)

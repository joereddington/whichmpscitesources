Amidst rumours of more Tory defections to UKIP its interesting that the only MPs put up by Tories for BBC by-election program were whips.
I don't agree with Douglas Carswell but his acceptance speech was pretty thoughtful stuff.
Strike that. At 2.42am the Tories on telly regurgitating same by-election lines as though any of 137 people still watching were persuadable.
At 2.17am the Tories on telly still regurgitating same by-election lines as though any of the 500 people still watching were persuadable.
The BBC find it harder to predict the times of these byelction results than the actual results themselves. #HurryUpClacton.

@BlackpoolFC fan told me today 'We didn't expect anything from today's game & that's what we got so I'm not disappointed.'
A new Club motto?
@BlackpoolFC fans are right to be worried. 10 games in and only 4 goals scored. Their two points have come from two 0-0 draws.
@NorwichCityFC seemed so focussed about @BlackpoolFC on the break today. Only loosened up & played after Blackpool scored......on the break.

Just about to go onto @talkSPORT  to discuss my '10 Football Matches that Changed the World' book. Guess we'll end up discussing 7-1.
I know grumbling about World Cup  referees is the done thing but Tory whips orchestrated low level booing of Commons Speaker unacceptable.
For 1st time in my life it feels less painful to be Scotland fan than Brazilian supporter. #Temporary? 
Our next game is against...Germany.
Guessing that the Brazilian pre-tournament 'is it worth all this money?' protests just might be about to get turbo-charged.
@AlistairBurtMP <Declare an interest.'A source close to Burt' (namely you) said you have £5 on them, could convert to € if you're that keen!
1970 victory helped create the mystique that is Brazilian football. This humiliation embarrasses the legacy of Pele, Rivellino & Jairzinho.
What is Brazil's worst ever World Cup score before this?

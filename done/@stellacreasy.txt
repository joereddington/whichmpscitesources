@PhilipDaviesMP um what do you think my political ends are Philip in querying your logic? Am still confused on how you identify merit?
@PhilipDaviesMP um Philip think you are getting overwrought - was genuine qu about your correlations on representation #calmdowndear ;-)
@PhilipDaviesMP if we can’t challenge the points each other make on such matters how can we make progress or offer choice to electorate?
@PhilipDaviesMP am sorry you feel the need to respond in such a way - am concerned your rhetoric on representation confused hence qus!
“@Claire_Phipps: @stellacreasy ”High Priestess of PC“ is surely your new Twitter bio? ;)” < do I get a mitre with that? If no hats then nfi!
Can you see by drawing that parallel you are making assumption as to what ‘merit’ looks like ? @PhilipDaviesMP what if higher than % in pop?
Extraordinary - did you really just get up to ask again about % of ethnic minorities in country vs % on boards @PhilipDaviesMP ?! #BISorals
Now @SheilaGilmoreMP pushing govt on need to better protect those on zero hours contracts - govt voted against again this week #BISorals
“@AudioSeal1: @PhilipDaviesMP @stellacreasy what do you mean by High Priestess of PC exactly?” < well I do pray for equality so…;-)
@PhilipDaviesMP didn’t  say target Philip- just asked what % you would say reflects merit ? Not like you not to have an opinion…
Now @ChukaUmunna up challenging govt on local enterprise partnerships network which is crumbling - vince cable seems unaware … #BISorals
@PhilipDaviesMP um Philip - I am capable of doing both but if you have problem with people tweeting why are you responding?! #awkward
Anyone who thinks appointments done solely on merit & that accounts for lack of diversity obviously isn’t very good at maths…;-) #BISorals
“@SacredJP: @PhilipDaviesMP @stellacreasy Bloody feminists! Stella, it should only EVER be about Merit, nothing else< agree..that’s point!
@PhilipDaviesMP i’m sure you’ll post up Hansard tomorrow - out of interest what % would you say reflects a meritorious system then?
@PhilipDaviesMP so when you said the ministers policy wasn’t based on representation or merit why pick out representation as concern ?
@PhilipDaviesMP  I listened carefully and you clearly argued % in population should be taken into account ..just following your logic!
Now @AndySawfordMP raising insecurity in the workplace & workers in Corby told to wait 8 weeks for their pay or leave #BISorals
Bizarrely @PhilipDaviesMP arguing 4 representation in boardrooms on % in population - expect to see him call for 51% women then.. #BISorals
Now @LiamByrneMP up pointing out number of reports higher education funding is unsustainable following govt fee increase debacle #BISorals
@blefuscu74 yes am coming to parliament tomorrow in time !
Now @IanMurrayMP asking why govt not offering funding for exporters- vince cable seems not to know help cut by £1m #BISorals

@danbunting @EVB_Now @Kevin_Maguire @CCriadoPerez  yes - that’s my point. Need to see risk of harm - distress & violence- and assess..
@bitteroranges email me details - main thing is anything that stops you being able to go to valuation tribunal ?
@EVB_Now @danbunting @Kevin_Maguire @CCriadoPerez pt2..offensive language 2 get involved rather than assess risk someone faces on or offline
@EVB_Now @danbunting @Kevin_Maguire @CCriadoPerez   Problem is still all about words not  behaviour so means police have to think it’s…pt1…

Wahey! here comes Jay Asher fresh from the campaign trail with @wesstreeting ! #comeonjay #xfactor
@RedRobertino she’s a good singer but was way too john lewisy for me….though think she’ll make the final….
Not able to respect this song in its perfect cheese genius AND doing it as a john lewis cover. THIS should not be allowed #xfactor
@vriyait well obviously for entertainment value and annoying @wesstreeting it HAS to be david brent but on singing…think its wide open!
@vriyait actually think its between her, James Argent and lauren to win it actually…oh and maybe owen jones too…;-)
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WILL SOMEONE TIE HER HAND BEHIND HER BACK! thank you…#dianavickersclaw #xfactor

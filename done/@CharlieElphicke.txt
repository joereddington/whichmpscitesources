The UK border controls at Calais are effective and must so. This Govt has taken strong action on border security and welfare tourism.
@MariaHutchings The UK border controls must remain effective. This Govt has taken strong action on border security and welfare tourism.
@locationsphotos Which is pretty much what I said!
@pripley2426 Is UKIP now suggesting we agree to move the border controls back to Dover?
@ukipdealdover If they weren't working there would not be calls from France to have them removed.
The UK border controls at Calais are doing an effective job keeping our borders safe & secure. They should remain in place.

@fiatlux55 Which would give you a Labour MP, no referendum and more Europe.
@fiatlux55 The true choice here is a Conservative MP who will vote for an EU referendum or a Labour MP who will always vote against one.
@fiatlux55 The simple truth is that UKIP will not have enough MPs to deliver a referendum. The Conservatives can and will if elected.
@fiatlux55 We are seeking to renegotiate and then let Britain decide on the EU in a referendum

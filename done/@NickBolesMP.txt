Great performance by @KellyTolhurst: quietly confident she will be taking her seat next May as MP for her home town
This tweet from @EmilyThornberry lifts the veil on Labour under @Ed_Miliband: would she have sneered so at a house covered in EU flags?
Getting a job is first step on road to better pay & greater security: people in work for more than 1 yr saw pay increase by 4.1%
An exciting start to my apprentice's first day at Parliament: the whole of Portcullis House evacuated cos of security scare over his iPad!
Vg from @chrisdeerin: we need more employers to create apprenticeships and other chances for young people. https://t.co/TEyJ9d1jga
Just back from fascinating 5 days in India: vast challenges matched by immense ambition, all fuelled by unquenchable optimism. Inspiring.
We want the recovery to deliver greater economic security for everyone. Control of payday lenders fees is an important piece in jigsaw.
I hope Simon Jenkins enjoys a comfy retirement in his many homes and stops trying to frustrate millions of others who want one of their own
At #RemembranceDay service in Bourne met a remarkable young man who wants to be an RAF pilot like his father who died in Iraq. Humbling.
Laying wreaths in Bourne & Grantham today. 100 years after WW1 there is so much courage and sacrifice for us to remember. #LestWeForget
To all the smart alecs doubting EU deal: 2 days ago how much did you think we would have to pay? £1.7b. How much will we now pay? £850m.
What a surprise: @Nigel_Farage reveals himself to be an egomaniac. Like all demagogues. http://t.co/zSK6YRAjOE
We were asked to pay £1.7b in 3 weeks' time. We will now be paying £850m in the second half of next year. That's what I call a result.
If rebate had always been going to apply to £1.7b surcharge why didn't @edballsmp say so at the time?
Great news for Bury St Edmunds, for Conservative Party and for Parliament as @Jochurchill4 is chosen as candidate. She is terrific.

Delighted that Greater Manchester will take lead on skills training and control incentive grant paid to employers creating apprenticeships
Best way to rebalance Britain & bring jobs & prosperity to all parts of country is to give strong local leaders powers to innovate & invest
Terrific bold move by @George_Osborne to devolve powers & money to new mayor of Greater Manchester. Bringing northern powerhouse into being.
Great chat with @LaborSec Tom Perez about apprenticeships. Obama administration keen to learn from success of UK apprenticeships programme

At last a commentator who understands the roots of public concern about immigration: http://t.co/gqP9NvH6zv
All my thoughts with Canada this morning. Great country, great allies, great friends.
If they spent their Saturdays manning street stalls, holding surgeries or knocking on doors their advice might cut a bit more ice 2/2
I wonder if the commentators sneering about public attitudes to immigration ever talk to anyone outside their own social or prof circle 1/2
I won't comment on private emails but I strongly support PM's move to put the control of EU immigration at the centre of any renegotiation
Call me pig headed but going to vote for EU referendum again today. Eventually we will force other parties to concede and give people a say.
I have not criticised @DouglasCarswell for his defection to UKIP because he is a good MP and an honest man. @MarkReckless is neither.
Breathtaking hypocrisy by @MarkReckless: he lobbied me repeatedly in favour of development at Lodge Hill. Rochester & Strood deserve better
So the last proper liberal announces he is leaving the LibDems. The modern Conservative Party is the true home for Gladstone's heirs.
Very sad my PPS @mikefreermp has resigned so he cd vote with his conscience in debate on Palestine. An honourable decision by a fine man.
Congrats to @DouglasCarswell. Good man, good MP. I hope he will condemn @Nigel_Farage's loathsome comment about 'quality' of people with HIV

Rest in peace, Alan Henning. You will be remembered and loved long after your murderers and all their works have been utterly destroyed.
As a friend of @matthancockmp and a bit of a queer myself, can I just say: give the man a break. He goofed, said sorry, no harm done.
As bedtime beckons, this thought from the PM might give me nightmares: of going to bed with Nigel Farage and waking up with Ed Miliband.
NHS, tax cuts, pride in UK and armed forces, starter homes, EU referendum, school reform, immigration control. That's my kind of politics.
V proud we secured planning permission for 230k houses in last year - now working to deliver PM's pledge of 3m apprenticeships 2015-20
No mum or dad wants their child to start life on benefits. That's why we are diverting money from benefits to create more apprenticeships.
Very proud this man is my colleague and friend: http://t.co/QH0CLEWn9y
Decision to commit UK forces always the hardest but PM made convincing case for participation in coalition attacks against Isil butchers.
Conservatives have made apprenticeships longer & more demanding, winning respect of employers & parents. Don't let Labour take us backwards.
In attempt to pump up numbers last Labour gov created 'programme-led' apprenticeships lasting under 12 months & not involving employers 1/2
What will Labour MPs do? Vote for more powers for Scotland and against English votes for English laws? That will take some explaining. 2/2
I look forward to voting for more devolution to Scottish Parliament AND for English votes for English laws as both are steps forward. 1/2
Basic principle: to make laws u need consent of people affected. In parly democracy that means a majority of the people they elect. 4/4
If ur PM without majority in England & lose vote on English proposal u may need to win confidence vote of all UK MPs to survive 3/4
If u don't have a majority of English MPs u need to persuade English MPs of other parties to support your proposals. 2/4
All English Votes 4 English Laws means is this. If u want to pass laws affecting only England u need a majority of English MPs votes. 1/4
English votes for English laws may be untidy but genius of British constitution is pragmatic evolution not grand design. 2/2
Never heard a constituent demand an English parliament. But none of them understand why Scottish MPs vote on English schools and NHS. 1/2
Thank you Scotland: not just for sticking with UK but for making long overdue reforms to Westminster-centric system of government inevitable
Nervous but optimistic this morning. Trust a clear majority of Scots to vote No and Union to be revived not damaged by electrifying campaign

Record fall in unemployment is a testament to the success of my predecessors in improving technical education and creating apprenticeships.
My mission is simple: to make sure every young person gets the skills they need to share in the benefits of economic recovery.
Chuffed to be taking over as skills and apprenticeships minister. Hitting the ground running at 9.30 with Westminster Hall debate.

Good debate on homelessness today. Gov is focusing on fundamentals: building more homes and creating more jobs so people can afford them
Miliband wants to give urban councils right to block conversion of offices into homes and grab land from rural neighbours instead.
I want to maximise the number of new homes we can get from existing buildings: offices, shops, farm buildings. Labour wants to block this
Miliband says we need more homes. I agree. But why has Labour opposed our steps to make conversion of offices into homes easier?
Coalition introduced 'duty to cooperate'.  It is strictly enforced: local plans are not approved without. Growth by consent not land grab.
Do people of Herts, Beds, Oxon not deserve a say about spread of Stevenage, Luton & Oxford into surrounding countryside? Miliband says no.
Coalition believes in cooperative solutions after negotiations between towns and surrounding areas. Labour's right to grow is right to grab
Most sites w planning permission are not being landbanked but are being built out or being got ready. http://t.co/X3MUeQ1kCT
No objection to workable measures to tackle landbanking. But Labour plan for confiscation wd lead to fewer planning consents & fewer houses
Of course housebuilding collapsed after crash: builders and buyers couldn't borrow. Tx to Help2Buy & planning reform rebounding strongly.
Labour housebuilding complaints a bit rich. They drove the car into the ditch, we hauled it out and now they say they wd drive it faster
If MP pay rise is imposed I'll give to local charities anything above average wage rise at time. IPSA plan is wrong when people struggling.

Joined Mayor @GeorgeFergusonx at Temple Quarter #EnterpriseZones to launch Bristol's first new speculative office development since crash.
Well done @TomDaley1994. Your athleticism made u a role model for kids already. Your courage and honesty makes you even more of one today.
Planning reform is working: 35% increase in annual no of new housing plots given planning permission. But still more to do.
Gov secures Jan cut in utility bills without undermining investment. Labour offers future freeze that will. Responsible gov vs reckless Lab.
@jimmurphymp's actions last night and self effacing statement today characteristic of the man. Proud to be in Parliament with him.
A sad day for our Scottish cousins, one which we English feel more keenly than if it happened in France or Sweden. Because we are family.
Did my bit to give EU referendum bill a strong mandate from elected Commons. Will unelected Lords deny the people who elected me a say?
I am campaigning to introduce 2 hours' free parking at car parks in Grantham & Stamford. Please sign my petition http://t.co/1TwzAsxdJ4
In managing transition out of econ crisis key is to target interventions carefully and withdraw support gradually as HMT & BoE are doing
This government studies the evidence before intervening. On cigarette packaging and payday lenders right to build the case and then act.
Have always expected Spain to say they will veto EU membership for an independent Scotland. But amazed that SNP has no convincing response.
@SJacksonMP Nothing I enjoy more than agreeing with my parliamentary neighbours Stewart!
Strongly welcome PM's plans to restrict benefits for EU migrants. I called for similar package in my 2010 book. http://t.co/PhQUpfx6qX
@BritProp event at Bankside: Big Society being realised in neighbourhood planning. 800 communities doing it, 5 out of 5 referendums won.
@LauraSandysMP is a tireless campaigner for hard pressed consumers. So sad she is standing down but family comes first.
Having run a small manufacturing business for 10 years happy to see that manufacturing is coming home http://t.co/fjKFV1qOc9
And bravo @stellacreasy for sticking to her guns
Bravo @George_Osborne for capping cost of payday loans and showing that helping hardworking people on tight budgets is Conservative priority
1.1 million more people are employed today than in 2010. Time for those who predicted a massive rise in unemployment to admit their error.
Fortunately @graemearcher explains far better than I did what I was trying to say @WeAreBrightBlue http://t.co/It7LxPuVOS
Rod Liddle and Max Hastings may not have liked what I said but being Sun's Hero of the Week counts for far more http://t.co/yxyRTi82sC
Fish and chips were tasty and @DouglasCarswell compelling in Grantham Museum last night.
Looking forward to welcoming @DouglasCarswell to Grantham later. Opening up party politics on the agenda. Fish & chips on the menu.
Any LibDems going to be joining us and voting for referendum on EU membership today? No I thought not. #liberalinnameonly
We owe our freedom to their sacrifice. Sun shining on #RemembranceDay in Stamford.
Heading back to London after speaking to Meriden Tories. Looking fwd to voting for James Wharton's referendum bill. #LetBritainDecide
Our planning reforms are cutting the bureaucratic burden businesses face and making it easier for them to develop and grow #businessisgreat
'Let nobody be in any doubt, he said, there is only going to be one outcome to this' And the outcome is Miliband giving into Unite thuggery.
Planning reform and Help To Buy unleash fastest growth in construction since 2007. Supply side is responding to demand support
With @LauraSandysMP in Worth where neighbourhood planning is helping community go from conflict to consensus http://t.co/zuGNZXnmrR
Local GP commissioners and I are determined to defend A&E at Grantham Hospital http://t.co/b7srZY58a7
Congratulations to my Telegraph tormenter Christopher Hope on 10 glorious years at the paper. Time for a promotion away from planning, Ed?
After Hunt bombs in Chamber hopeless Labour whipping gives Gove easy victory despite LibDem abstention. They can't even oppose effectively.
Little more obnoxious than the sight of a Labour posh boy trying to kick the ladder of opportunity away just to please union militants
Carswell critics, no MP is more willing to oppose govt when conscience dictates. His position on HS2 is honourable http://t.co/ZS6aPchHx7
What happens when you try to restrict an ancient freedom? People rally to defend it.
Packed newcomers day in Barholm. Hounds flushing to a golden eagle. http://t.co/rAh5zWBmeP
Great to visit beautiful new community being created by Places for People at Broadlands in Milton Keynes http://t.co/xXkgFCkedm
Enjoyed RTPI Politicians in Planning event in Milton Keynes. We don't all agree but I respect anyone who takes responsibility for planning
Growth of 0.8% encouraging. New housebuilding a crucial contributor.
Tattenhall registers spectacular 96% yes vote on 52% turnout in neighbourhood plan referendum. A triumph for Tattenhall and localism.
Fraser Nelson is right that the Conservative Party is now the true home of liberal ideas and values http://t.co/gY7pm4mYKz
Grabbing early lunch outside on Commons terrace while prepping for Westminster Hall debate on planning. Only company a fat grey seagull.
Just been grilled by Andrew Neil at Construction News summit. Urged industry to invest in new capacity to support surge in housebuilding.
Simon Stevens is a great hire as new NHS England chief exec. A true reformer with bags of practical experience. Great move by Jeremy Hunt.
The NHS isn't free: we pay for it through our taxes. So it makes sense to charge those who don't pay taxes in UK for the care they receive.
At the despatch box answering questions from 230 today. A year on it still gives me butterflies.
Clegg thinks that the freedoms enjoyed by his old school are too good for free schools. Don't look to LibDems to defend your freedoms, folks
Clegg's rejection of true Liberals continues with repudiation of David Laws defense of free schools. Liberal conservatism beckons, David.
On duty in the Commons today and preparing to reply to Caroline Spelman on Property Blight Compensation Bill. My brain aches.
Lively evening with Wealden Conservatives last night. Vigorous debate but all agreed that Charles and Sallie Hendry will be greatly missed.
Grateful to the editor of The Times for this generous acknowledgement http://t.co/CaCizWLvOk
UK is really good at big infrastructure projects like London Gateway but we need to cut the time it takes to get permission
DP World's London Gateway is phenomenal. http://t.co/PU4wDaiG2g
Well done Supreme Court for sensible judgment on prisoner voting. Let British judges judge British laws.
Good luck "@GrahamEvansMP: Thanks to @NickBolesMP for his visit #Hartford to meet Hartford Neighbourhood Plan Working Group"
Congrats to Lincs County Lincs Fire & Rescue and EMAS for winning £491k to fund development of innovative approach to ambulance provision
Big fan of Shelter but opponents of #helptobuy never explain alternative remedy. Nationalise housebuilding? Engineer 30% house price crash?
Price bubble only a risk if housing supply doesn't respond to meet increased demand. #helptobuy plus planning reform means #helptobuild 2/2
Stable house prices requires builders to build lots more houses. But builders only build if they have customers with funds to buy.1/2
May I wish all my British Muslim friends colleagues and constituents a happy and peaceful Eid ul-Adha
Fabulous fundraiser for Margaret Thatcher statue project at Grantham Museum. Malcolm Rifkind warm funny and insightful about the Lady.
Blowy walk around Barrowby Edge site for David Wilson and Bellway Homes. Happy to see new homes going up in Grantham! http://t.co/wg4zcoELJO
Great news that Grantham is getting 5 more trains a day to Kings Cross and 3 more a day back again. Some only take 1hr 5mins, folks.
IMF predicts better UK growth. Why? Spending cuts, low interest rates, deregulation (inc planning reform) and investment in infrastructure.
When I bought my first flat 20+ yrs ago the deposit was equivalent to less than 6 months salary. Not true today so we need #helptobuy
Great visit to Bell and Webster Grantham's fast-growing manufacturer of student accommodation. Orders up, employment up. #turningthecorner
Great chat at Stamford Civic Society last night. Lots of ideas about how to build beautiful places like we used to.
Building a land of opportunity for hardworking people: fastest growth in housing construction in 10 years. Lots done, lots still to do.
Very troubled by rumours about Grantham A&E. ULHT managers need to know this: I will fight any downgrade to this vital high quality service
Never been so proud to be a Conservative. Jo Morey and the inspirational story of Bedford Free School. #cpc13
Want to know why young people from Peckham should read 'dead white men'? Listen to blistering speech from Lindsay Johns #cpc13
Powerful argument from @TimMontgomerie identifying more housebuilding as most effective support for families http://t.co/CLMCdHmL3t
Looking forward to discussing this and other housing and planning issues at Housing Fringe at 1245 and with @ConHome at 1430 #cpc13
Dining with Bourne Round Table organisers of a flourishing real ale and live music festival. Just wish I knew some good after dinner jokes.
Morning run thru the park at Burghley. England at its most ravishing. And, in every sense of the word, free.
People get tax relief for saving, charitable giving and renting a room. Implies no judgment of those who don't benefit. Ditto marriage.
Roll up roll up for Stamford's Georgian Festival complete with bull run, horse drawn carriage rides and the knicker lady! Don't ask...
Great to visit beautiful Broughton with MP Philip Hollobone. Good luck with the neighbourhood plan. It's your chance to take control.
Good discussion at Business Breakfast club in Stamford of dire implications of Labour's socialist policies for business investment and jobs
Price controls, nationalisation, more benefits and higher taxes on business? Seriously? Is there something about the 70s I missed?
We need to build more houses. So why does Labour oppose policies that have delivered surge in planning consents and construction orders?
Conservatives less certain of our moral superiority so know that how we behave towards others matters as much as the goals we set 2/2
Lefties sometimes so convinced of righteousness of their ideals they persuade themselves appalling methods are justified 1/2
Miliballs to scupper HS2, block free schools and put academies back under local gov yoke. Time for Blairites to join true Tory progressives.
It's no good spouting sonorous pledges to 'iron discipline' without specific details of spending cuts to fund new freebies. #SameOldLabour
34% increase in annual total of planning approvals for new homes to 156,608. Housebuilding turning a corner but still a long way to go.
Delighted to support new SKDC chm David Nalson at civic service in Stamford. Tho felt distinctly underdressed without a chain of office!
How is this fair Mr Miliband? #somethingfornothing #sameoldlabour
Hard working family paying for housing from wages, unable to afford a spare room. Single person on benefits getting a spare room for free.
The agony of indecision. Trainers or loafers? Chinos or jeans? Hoody or cardigan? Which is more reshuffle-friendly? #smartcasual
Off to Germany to find out how they manage to build many more new houses, bigger and better too, and keep house prices stable in real terms
Just bought Ben Macintyre's Operation Mincemeat and Agent Zigzag from treasure trove Walkers in Stamford High St #booksaremybag
Delighted that Colsterworth parish council is working up a neighbourhood plan. Long hard slog - but it will be worth it.
Called into Queen Eleanor's School in Stamford to congratulate head Wendy Hamilton on superb Maths results - 71% A*-C Well done all!
Great news that Monitor backs plans for investment in development of services at Stamford Hospital. We must hold NHS to this promise.
What I actually said about planning in national parks yesterday: http://t.co/Ac5mUo6bOw #dontbelieveeverythingyoureadinthepapers
Unemployment in Grantham & Stamford 1945 in May 2010, 1713 now. People's hard work and sacrifice starting to pay off. #turningthecorner
Tx to Simon Hart MP for good debate on planning in National Parks. Open to ideas about how to make it more responsive to local people
Great news, @ULHTnews to receive an additional £8m to meet winter pressures on A&E. Sensible pre-emptive action by @Jeremy_Hunt
Is there any battle @Ed_Miliband will fight, any bully he will face down? Or is it to be capitulation every time?
Pressed @rgdavies LCC highways supremo to okay work through the night and at weekends to get it finished
Bridge End Rd/Springfield Rd roadworks causing mayhem in Grantham for 6 weeks now
Oops. I'm told the magnificent Mallard reached 126mph not 124. Another great invention from this small island! http://t.co/HlvlINxIcC
The magnificent Mallard is back in Grantham this weekend @mallardgrantham 75yrs after 124.5mph record-breaking run
My attempt to emulate @DouglasCarswell, http://t.co/VEpnNedbzj
This weekend sees world's best horse trials at Britain's most beautiful house @burghleyhouse. Stamford welcomes you all!
Many thanks & good luck to @lynbrownmp, @HOLTofLondon & local campaigners in fight to save Newham's wonderful Spotted Dog 15th C pub

Surely you need a get out clause which gives final decision to the on field umpires. Ridiculous.
@TenterdenTown Will try again!
@floetry It is!
Most important line in John McTernan Miliband article is last one. "He was communications director for Julia Gillard." That went well.

Labour never gripped bogus colleges which was the biggest of their many loopholes-- and complained when we did grip it. #sameoldlabour
Problem was not that Lab didn't have points-based system early enough. Net migration kept rising after they introduced it.
@fifisyms ummm...looks like a big Twitterglitch to me, and presumably to Mr Mills!
@jdportes Only ad hominem because it was you arguing against bubbles, rather like the noughties one you now pray in aid. We just differ!
@jdportes And the other years? And working for the Government did not entail contributing to disastrous economic policy?
@MirrorJames And best wishes and goodnight to you! Am (rather sadly) watching Newsnight on holiday.
@MirrorJames The Blair-Brown bubble was about more than bankers and you backed them all the way to national disaster.
@MirrorJames economic policy for decades!
@MirrorJames And your paper slavishly supported the worst
Unbelievable to see @jdportes warning about economic bubbles on Newsnight. What happened when you were advising Blair and Brown?
@S_Herbie My view not relevant! FWIW I think he's brilliant. Not just Malcolm Tucker-really good in The Hour.
So happy Saturday evenings in prospect! Phew.

@SebastianEPayne  Brian Jones was brilliant until the drugs got him
@toadmeister err Mick Taylor
Also in County Square in Ashford Citizens Advice Bureau Awareness Day. Need new volunteers.
Ashford town centre awash with support for Armed Forces Day. Military vehicles surrounding the Bandstand!
@ACCGarethMorgan this takes three days!
“@alstewitn: #glasto 'Arctic Monkeys'. Good but just short of compelling.” Exactly right. Nearly but not quite brilliant
This morning I will be launching transformation project for criminal justice system. Police and courts both going digital.
Arrived at Chester for ACPO professional standards conference.
@floetry Yes but......!
Eagerly anticipating Episode 2 of #TheWhiteQueen especially the pedicure scene.
No
After the Lions we can't have another last gasp escape surely?
Happy Birthday @alstewitn ! You can now do double celebration with the Lions.
Lunch on the run problem solved by Ashford Food and Drink Festival. Crepe and Baclava was my multi-national solution.
Fun and noisy morning with mothers and toddlers at Willow Centre in Ashford.
“@sajidjavid: Thanks colleagues for joining me for pint of Sajid's Choice in Strangers Bar to celebrate 1st beer duty cut in 54 yrs."Cheers!
#whitequeenAnd what was with the Zip on her frock?
Big discovery in #thewhitequeen is how clean and clear-skinned everyone was in 1464.
@BB_Milton never heard of them!
At St George's Cathedral in Southwark for a mass to celebrate significant marital milestones. At 25 Alicia and I are in rows well behind 50!
Appearing on@daily_politics South East this Sunday talking about asylum seekers, City of Culture, and rubbish. Full and varied!
Another day to remember two brave police officers murdered by unspeakable Dale Cregan.
Waiting for @pmharper who is about to speak to both Houses of Parliament.
@Tenterdencallum I assume I didn't get one!
Though looking at Twitter will clearly have to catch up on Sunday Politics! @BBCPolitics
Lovely service for new Ashford Mayor David Smith at St Mary's Willesborough. Especially good choir and organist.
Great traditional stalls at Boughton Lees Fayre. And award-winning cheerleaders from Towers School. #englishsummer
@immikhan @sundersays Care to produce a shred of evidence that I have ever done that?
Thanks to all at Bluebell Children's centre in Hothfield. Doing a great job helping hundreds of families.
Good to see the work being done at the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust in Lewisham.
“@fifisyms: 2 - 2 draw not very heartening on #Coronation60th” Don't agree. England better than usual. In 1953 we were murdered by Hungary!
“@sundersays: @damiangreenmp Mark Hateley unlucky that his Dad, Tony, was never capped for England” I agree, feeling my age.
Oh.
@DavidJonesMP Am enjoying a rare moment of pure joy at Wayne Rooney!
@DavidJonesMP to be fair that would have been more fun than the first half of this game.
And first goal scored for England in Brazil by former Southampton player with double barrelled name.
A goal for stats freaks. First England goal in Brazil scored by son of former England player who played against Brazil...?
Good fun opening new "brompton dock" bike hire at Ashford Station. Come and enjoy Kent countryside. Will be rural version of Boris bikes.
@Tenterdencallum @PictforUK Sounds a very dangerous award!
@fifisyms @GilesMacDonogh Will the two of you stop flirting on Twitter!
Lively exchanges about Ashford Town Centre and local education at Kent Invicta Chamber of Commerce breakfast. Brisk start to day.
Next year Emilie Sande then.
@emsie1979 shame! Adam was right.
Disappointed at UK 12 points for Denmark. #predictable #eurovision
Greece. Ireland. Finland. Georgia. Togo. It may be late on a Saturday night.  #eurovision
Ooh Georgia would certainly have won in the 80s  #eurovision
A cocoon in a silent tree is the best opening so far. Even better than the shoes and Jeremy in IT.  #eurovision

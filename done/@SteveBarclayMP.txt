@andrewpolitics Telling the health regulator not to publish information and being furious when they have done are shown clearly in the docs
@andrewpolitics How can it be a smear when emails are quoted directly? Labour not addressing that emails show clear political interference
Bizarre also for Labour to say allegations of gagging CQC are old when evidence in emails only now emerged http://t.co/ZX4If8Yc4Z
Strange line from Labour - that quoting directly from CQC/Dept Health emails is a Tory smear. Text speaks for itself http://t.co/ClyNS49MFS
Will #Burnham make a new statement to the Commons next week now emails show political interference with CQC? http://t.co/7jJVgzZYUb
Why did Labour's health minister say CQC must clear press releases with them? Why the political meddling? http://t.co/7jJVgzZYUb
In July Burnham told Parl 'no shred of evidence' of political interference with CQC. Emails provide evidence http://t.co/7jJVgzZYUb

Hope @Jeremy_Hunt will consider what guidance can issue re hiring as consultants previous NHS mgrs criticised in official reports #morecambe
@Jarmann a force for good in NHS. Those on left attacking him should explain why last gov bought half Dr Foster in 06 if don't like his data
Not surprised Mike #Farrar has quit. Was CEO NW Strategic Heath Authority with oversight at Morecambe Bay. Then hired disgraced CEO #Halsall

Ahead of today’s PAC hearing about massive pay-offs to unnamed BBC executives, here are some key points: http://t.co/7bzJpm8xMo
@MatthewPHalsey Main person responsible Mark Thompson not at the hearing today sadly but is due before Parl in the autumn.
Joined @SuzyBookbinder on @lbc973 to discuss today's PAC hearing on massive BBC payoffs to unnamed execs paid more than entitled to.
“Criminal bankers should be made to pay the costs” – my article on page 9 of today’s Financial Times http://t.co/a6rTJDss2u

Unbelievable - Dept Health confirm to me that they spent £73,563 on external consultants to help officials prepare for just one PAC hearing.
Very odd call from Dept Health. Will the info I requested be as a letter to me as an MP or as a member of the PAC.  Why the difference?
Labour today have said they oppose plans to tighen rules for foreigners accessing NHS without paying. Clear they still want to spend & spend
@C_Barratt_ will need relevant business experience but find North Cambs under represented in many areas so local knowledge of area be good
East of England Ambulance Trust is recruiting for new non exec board members. Be good to have someone who understands our area on board

Private Eye (Andrew Bousfield) reported CQC whistleblowers. I met 2 CQC whistleblowers in Commons 18 months ago. So why did DH not meet them
Sir David Nicholson needs to clarify what he was notified & when on Morecambe, as should DH panel members who carried out 5 month CQC review
M@JamesTitcombe Is it not a criminal offence to delete emails to a police investigation after being notified?
@JamesTitcombe Dept Health has some emails as will local hospitals. Internal CQC emails between key players may need forensic investigators.
@JamesTitcombe Agree. Have asked for CQC papers to be published & meeting them on Wed in Parliament to follow up.

@MarkGSparrow @Annette1Hardy Have not seen report yet but suspect will be grounds for prosecution. What did profession bodies do to help?
@Annette1Hardy @MarkGSparrow Yes is because so serious that we need to learn the lessons from when things go wrong & have more open culture
Great @lbc973 investigation shows BBC paid £22m silencing its own staff with gagging clauses. Joined @SuzyBookbinder earlier to discuss
@KfordBloke Yes of course more than one person. Is cultural problem with NHS leadership. Those who fail often reappear elsewhere in system
@Edwina_Currie Agree. Culture of too many NHS managers has been to cover up problems & ignored families. Whether Mid Staffs or now Morecambe
My blog from Jan 2012 highlighting flaws with CQC. Today's report shows even worse than Parl told then. http://t.co/9X4WFvUR9m

@BillHicks123 which is why data is key. Constituents don't want their kids to be operated on in a hospital with higher error rates. Do you?
For complex operations we need fewer more specialised centres of excellence. Local MPs should not condemn constituents to second rate care
The problem with our NHS is clinical outliers have not been acted on eg #Midstaffs. Sir Bruce being attacked for finally doing so in Leeds.
Sir Bruce #Keogh is right to ensure high mortality data at Leeds is investigated. Local convenience should not override clinical outcomes
@epyfc yes.
Large turnout last night at public meeting over Estover playing fields. Made clear my support for residents. Imp FDC now acts on concerns
Congratulations to David Broker on his election as Cllr for Parson Drove & Wisbech St Mary. A great addition to Fenland District Council
@Horridharriet congratulations on the Blue Peter badges. Well done to everyone involved.
@iaincollins cheers Iain. Whitehall for years has said it will develop more specialists and less generalists. In practice little has changed

Real #NHS reform needs to see accountability for past failings, as I write in today's @TelegraphNews :http://t.co/0rv8fMrNA0
Cartoonist Chris Crump captures the frustrations of those who want to see real accountability in the NHS: http://t.co/eczvtq7Z2s
Welcome response to #Francis.Today not an excuse to sweep past under the carpet.Patients need openness and candour about past cover ups.#NHS
Telegraph picks up on the deafening silence from Dept Health officials as to whether #MidStaffs CEO gagged @Telegraph http://t.co/HWnv8RWfNq
Interested in Heritage Lottery Funding grants of +£3K. Go to St Andrew's Hall, Whittlesey 18th April 10am to 3pm. Contact rachelf@hlf.org.uk
We still do not know total payoff to #yeates & how much went via pension payment to avoid need for Treasury sign off, or if he was gagged.
Why are key docs not being uploaded onto the official #Francis website as promised eg David Florry evidence to Francis on #Yeates
Fenland is the first to bid for state of the art Agri-Tech funding:http://t.co/vtaOKk6uIX
Dept Health said would write to all NHS bodies asking if ever used judicial mediation to circumvent Treasury controls. Has letter been sent?
After #Nicholson forced to apologise for misinforming PAC, did 2nd official do so over international position of NHS http://t.co/D9ABPM7p6D
@philipcable @WisbechRail Absolutely support. Crucial we connect to Cambridge But where is proper cost/benefit analysis esp re crossing A47?
@LooBlackburn @C7RKY @curetheNHS @itsmyNHS @margarethodge yes Sir David Nicholson says only aware of 1 judicial meditation (Gary Walker).
@JoinedU1 Dept Health still refusing to answer. In response to my PQ on whether Yeates gagged, refused to say. Now a test for Sec of State
Sir David Nicholson's Comedy of Errors continues...See my article @Telegraph :http://t.co/8H8qBluUcV
@johnelworthy Liz is rightly leading on this as her constituency so I will not be at the meeting but happy to continue to support
My article in the Guardian on today's budget enclosed.  http://t.co/o4ZUYb8Fqv
In The Times' 30 Best Towns in Britain guide today, Wisbech listed at number 24.  Good to see the Fens recognised so positively
Prayers in #Parliament are overflowing today-praying for the right outcome or a guaranteed seat for 1.5hr slog in the chamber? #BudgetDay
How much more bungling and backtracking can the #NHS take? :http://t.co/vADIRvA2QO
Sir David Nicholson has apologized to the PAC for giving incorrect answers to  questions about #NHS whistleblowers: http://t.co/PS74KV77CK
Delighted to celebrate the kick-start of new schools' rugby scheme: http://t.co/1ZIiH4BatR
Nicholson tells PAC did not know what judicial mediation was yet he is responsible for system through which it was paid eg to Gary Walker
Still 2 weeks on Health Dept yet to answer on whether #midstaffs CEO #Yeates was subject to a gagging clause.  Note requested within 7days
At PAC Nicholson confirmed Barbara Hakin appointed Dep CEO without telling Health Sec & whilst under GMC investigation. Measure of his power
As @CLeslieMP points out- years of NHS #CoverupCulture cost lives. Why has nobody taken direct responsibility? http://t.co/OV8UZLirAS
Hospital mortality data has been available for 12 years- Why did senior #NHS managers have no idea what was going on?http://t.co/obx8B2myxt
2 weeks ago in my adjournment debate Health Minister asked if #midstaffs boss #yeates payoff had gagging clause. Still no answer. Why delay?
@PeterThurlow Mortality data published since 2001, high in Mid Staffs eg 2005 so not 2 months. This gov approved public inquiry immediately
@ProfAlanMaynard @BBCr4today you miss my point - if good reason for variation fine. But have to investigate /understand not dismiss outliers
Half of 14 hospitals now under urgent investigation were on Prof Jarman's March 2010 list to Burnham. Where does accountability sit?
@BBCr4today Prof Jarman warned March 2010 of high death rates in 25 hospitals. No action taken in any of these hospitals by Burnham or CQC
We need straight answers and deeper change from #NHS management to restore patient trust in the system.http://t.co/xndr7riJXi
As highlighted on @BBCToday- there is plenty left to be done if we want to return transparency to the #NHS. :http://t.co/Gp6N7eH8oZ
V.welcome Sec of State has changed rules on #GaggingClauses. So why did Sir David tell me it wasn't an issue? #NHS: http://t.co/fhwtvVQ87k
@l_j0204 @BBCr4today yes PIDA meant often not enforceable but gagging clauses still had chilling effect as legal risk sat with whistleblower
Gov to announce tomorrow it will ban gagging clauses for #NHS whistleblowers. Be discussing in morning on @BBCr4today around 7.50.
@jimmyfountain1 thanks James. Hope you enjoyed Westminster today. Key is to keep the commercial balance between growers and British Sugar.
@bfrposh @CAMRA_Official Don't sign EDMs as not value for money. Do support CAMRA's campaign and put that in writing instead.
Looking forward to the next step in securing a state of the art Agri-Tech centre for Wisbech: http://t.co/gbPPnjmopl
@tomkrone  yes the failure of auditors at RBS has still not been dealt with. Likewise conflict of interest of fund managers
@Josie_Ratcliffe absolutely Josie.  Scout Leaders do a great job.
Accountability should be at the heart of #NHS reform: http://t.co/Br4Ji4X51q
@tomkrone @oldsmith @heatherawwood @JamesTitcombe Keep trying. Have raised whistleblower concerns on PAC for +2 years. Needs persistence
@tomkrone @heatherawwood @JamesTitcombe Not correct. Said will look at it- born & grew up in N Lancs - but local MPs & NAO should also do so
Witnesses before PAC have it easy - they should try being grilled by the Wisbech St Mary scouts http://t.co/hupXElW1iQ
@DebHazeldine @C7RKY @heatherawwood yes used taxpayers money to pay Birmingham Uni to challenge Imperial's data rather than act on data
If CQC board did not discuss mortality data suggests was sidelined #midstaffs. Yet @andyburnhammp dismissed warnings March 2010 quoting CQC
#whistleblower #midstaffs just told me CQC board did not receive information on mortality figures. #Nicholson also denied receiving them.
Skills for Health says offers tested solutions on health productivity & quality. Cynthia #Bower #midstaffs on board  http://t.co/hLNx1PlKrD
@tomkrone it is not an either or. £1.1bn of fraud linked to charity sector so right to examine whether regulator is fit for purpose
Moy Park factory's Tony O’Neill, Executive Director Convenience Foods & Roger Martin, Director Operations to meet FDC bosses on Mon 18 March
@Puffles2010 @drwollastonmp on Tues we  secured some backbench time for debate on NHS on 14/3. Also scandal is about much more than one man.
@Puffles2010 any accountability.....
Asked HMT for number of judicial mediation payments made as #Nicholson said was how whistleblower Gary Walker gagged. HMT 1 week to respond
Gov needs to review the role of Accounting Officers. Nicholson at Health Cttee, SFO & Charity Commission today at PAC shows role not working
@judyk113 @tamcohen absolutely agree. Especially as he is the Accounting Officer responsible for the money.
@AlexiMostrous well they could hardly describe themselves as a dynamic duo!
@Lifeinasandwich thanks.CC front line staff are being let down by weak leadership. Amazed CEO had no idea of his own data on his own website
Charities Commission appearing before #PAC: Regulators failing to clampdown on the hijacking of charities by aggressive tax dodge schemes.
Charitable status should not be abused for tax avoidance schemes.Public money should be used to regulate Charitable work-not tax dogers.#PAC
@PAC: Charity Commission is making excuses for failing to clamp down on charities as cover-ups for tax avoidance schemes.
Delighted to join forces with @CambsCops and others to clamp down on rogue landlords in Wisbech: http://t.co/UEXUQj62pO
Look out for our comments on East of England Ambulance response times on @itvanglia news this evening- let's put patients first.
Telegraph #Midstaffs:'The establishment has failed to grasp the scale of the public's horror . It has closed ranks to defend its own'
@DailyTelegraph: 'The establishment has failed to grasp the scale of the public's horor.It has closed ranks to defend its own'
As @PaulGoodman puts it: Reform of the #NHS requires change-not the same old excuses :http://t.co/CNFqv8eaHN
The buck stops at the top. Especially in the NHS #Coverupculture: http://t.co/efmfKQD1Qn
Nicholson had 'no idea' on Mid Staffs: http://t.co/BGPAszMlGA
Sir David Nicholson says 'NHS had no culture of sharing info across the system'. He was 'never aware' of hospital mortality rates.

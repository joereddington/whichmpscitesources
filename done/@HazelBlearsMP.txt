Great that Oakwood Youth Club has received £1,000 from @FootballFoundtn to create new teams.  Sport = happiness and good health for children
@northern_gent Yes - men also suffer abuse and I would urge any man who has concerns about their partner to consider using Clare's Law
Great to see more being done to publicise #Clare's Law, which enables women to find out if their partner has a violent past.@gmpolice@gmpcc
And a reminder for MPs to come along to Westminster Hall room W3 from 12.30-2.30pm to sign a pledge promising to pay your interns!
Really good debate on unpaid internships earlier - pleased that MPs from all parties feel as passionately as I do.
Calling all MPs! Come along to my event at room W3, Westminster Hall, 12.30pm-2.30pm tomorrow, and pledge to pay your interns.

@TGHarding @ProgressOnline Thanks Tom - be very interested to hear - http://t.co/0wNVzhDC@parliament.uk Best of luck for when you start!
@TGHarding @ProgressOnline the criteria are currently too narrow. I think all who have served should have the opportunity - least we can do!
@TGHarding @ProgressOnline Hi Tom - great to hear you are starting University soon. I know they provide some free places, but I think (1/2)

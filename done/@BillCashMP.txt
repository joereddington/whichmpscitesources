No to German Europe & Merkel’s red line. 1 Nov EU voting system = unacceptable German veto over UK immigration

EU Budget: The money comes from our constituents. Money from the taxpayer. It does not grow on trees. That is what they do not understand
EU deal on roughly €1 trillion in spending? They must be living on another planet. It cannot go on. EU Budget rebellion justified.

EU Summit: “Ultimately … a treasury office” and “fully-fledged fiscal union” says Van Rompuy report. UK must not allow EU superstate.
We need a referendum on the proposed Fiscal Union: http://t.co/Th6jxGJu
Greek election changes nothing. Spain is imploding. Europe is in crisis. UK is in danger of fiscal/political union. Referendum is essential.
UEF arguments dangerous. Federal union deepens the democratic/economic black hole and guarantees riots, unemployment, despair and no growth
Merkel is wrong. David Cameron must pursue “Herculean” task of rejecting Germany’s push for political union. A referendum is essential.

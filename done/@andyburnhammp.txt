In 2010, there were 163 #NHS organisations. There are now 440. Tory re-organisation saving £1 billion a year? Utter rubbish.
After @kieran_walshe's devastating critique on #r4today, onus now on @Jeremy_Hunt to publish independent estimate of £1bn saving from reorg.
Later tonight, I will vote to #RecognisePalestine. Two-state solution dying before our eyes & we urgently need to change terms of debate.
Will ask @Jeremy_Hunt if he knows which "senior cabinet minister" said: “We’ve made 3 mistakes I regret, the first being restructuring NHS.”

Memo to @David_Cameron:  "protecting" NHS budget not enough to repair damage of your reorganisation. Needs new money + repeal of toxic Act.
NHS facing huge funding pressures in 2015-20 Parliament. It is just not credible for Tories to make new promises without finding new money.
.@David_Cameron says he wants to make it easier to see a GP. Why, then, has he spent the last four and a half years making it harder?
Cameron: "there's nothing we've done which makes it more likely there'll be private provision in NHS". That is a straightforward falsehood.
Telling line from @George_Osborne speech: "don’t let anyone in this Party concede the NHS to Labour". Suggests he thinks they already have.

@CCHQPress Your plan is to charge people £72k, £144k per couple. Right?
Most troubling aspect of today's waiting time figures is revelation that around 160,000 people have been missing off official lists.
In PMQs early July, @David_Cameron claimed #NHS waiting times were improving. Figures out this morning show #NHS missed his target for June.
@chrisshipitv Do you really think that's comparable? Real issue affecting millions now v process issue in 6 years? You're making my point.
@keirshiels @chrisshipitv @suttonnick With respect, that is a regional news story.
@chrisshipitv @suttonnick Sorry Chris but something that *might* happen in 2020 is not worthy of leading today's news. London media bubble.
How can BBC justify putting one self-obsessed man's career ambitions at top of the news? Media infatuation with this circus is embarrassing.
In June 2010, number of people waiting over 6 weeks for tests was 3510. Now 15,780. Yet another sign of decline of #NHS under @David_Cameron

@ToryShorty The Tory plan is to let people pay £72,000 for care, £144,000 per couple, £144,000 + interest if deferred after death. Correct?
The bill for agency staff, now bleeding the #NHS dry, has DOUBLED under @David_Cameron & is direct result of his disastrous reorganisation.
When Labour left office, #NHS FTs spent 766m on agency staff. £1.37bn now. Might just be linked to Govt cutting 10,000 nurse training places
#NHS workforce planning went into meltdown with Cameron reorganisation. Since then, bill for agency staff has soared to £2.6 BILLION a year.

So, in summary, @UKStatsAuth letter confirms A&E has got worse under @David_Cameron & @Jeremy_Hunt & their statements on it can't be trusted
@Toryhealth Dilnot: "HSCIC advised that the time to departure estimate is likely to be the most complete" (ie Tory stats are incomplete)
@Toryhealth Dilnot: "The median duration to departure time in 09/10 was 122 minutes and 128 minutes in 12/13."
@Toryhealth Dilnot: "The mean duration to departure time in 09/10 was 135 minutes and in 12/13 it was 141 minutes."
@Toryhealth Read the letter again. You'll find the measure you quote is not most complete & not one normally used in Parliamentary answers.
@UKStatsAuth confirms that, on the most complete measure, A&E waiting times have got worse under @David_Cameron > http://t.co/nDPrZqof3w

Embarrassing that #r4today can find yet more airtime for this Mr Whippy rubbish but not for a proper debate on the NHS.
Fourth piece of spin. @Jeremy_Hunt says we're investing in community services. In fact, he's cut community teams, GP services & social care.
Third piece of spin. @Jeremy_Hunt isn't the first Health Minister to go on the front line. I started it in 2006.
Second piece of spin. @Jeremy_Hunt hasn't prioritised mental health. In fact, he has cut it faster than the rest of the #NHS.
First piece of spin from @Jeremy_Hunt. #NHS has not "become best health system in last 4 years". It was in that position in 2010. #r4today
Once again, #r4today gives a Government Minister the prime 8.10 slot without offering Labour a right of reply. So much for balance.

@hitman8976rawk Don't agree. The Premier League has been in the ascendancy ever since La Liga went for individual selling of TV rights.
Time has come for English football to decide what it wants: best league in the world or best national team. Nigh-on impossible to have both.
This World Cup is wide open.
Why is the #NHS in a bad financial state? Because it wasted £3 billion on re-organisation & handed another £3 billion back to the Treasury.
New figures show 2,993,108 people on #NHS waiting list - 6-year high. With 6 trusts not reporting data, the list has now topped 3 million.

Figures just out show #NHS now missing national cancer targets. No amount of spin from @Jeremy_Hunt can disguise deterioration on his watch.
NHS re-organisation Round 2. What a mess they made > “@HSJEditor: NHS England set to drop key functions under Stevens' refocussing of org”
“@Howard139: @andyburnhammp a tweet for my 40th Birthday would be great. #GoOnDoIt” > Enjoy your day, as it's all downhill from here!
GP poster campaign is vindication of @Ed_Miliband's decision to make GP waits election issue. Will be big in 2015 > https://t.co/0IKECuad31
.@David_Cameron promised to give GPs a voice. Now they're reduced to running poster campaigns to make him listen > https://t.co/dpJeSsu696
Good luck to @ste_finn & @JHowEFC08 running @RnRLiverpool for @Everton in the Community > http://t.co/QrYi8FtwLP https://t.co/uL7XWAIZoS
100% with Atletico here. Underdogs everywhere are biting back. #theschoolofscienceisonthewayback
And, by the way, that's not just a partisan point. I've also got the Tories, LibDems & Greens in mind when I say that.
Will always be big supporter of BBC. But @BBCNews needs to have long, hard look at balance (or lack of) in its coverage over recent weeks.
He's got a point > peterjohn6: Oh come on @BBCNews - this pathetic obsession with UKIP is demeaning. Labour won local elections convincingly
@oflynndirector Thanks for that Patrick. But, better still, how about a reply to the letter I sent to your boss? > https://t.co/RFd6ePifIJ
“@1957AJB: @RnRLiverpool And calling all Reds I presume Andy-This Red will contribute-shoulder injury knocked me out of race”>thanks so much
Calling all Blues. This lad ran to Cardiff game with me. Running @RnRLiverpool for EITC. Give him few quid if you can>http://t.co/QrYi8FtwLP
@lobbygobblers 1) I didn't say you were a Tory 2) That part of town was empty when I opened + helping bring in cinema is not doing 'nothing'
@LouiseMensch Two things: 1) If you re-read letter, you will find no 'party political' points; 2) Commons paper comes in green, blue & red.
@GuidoFawkes FYI: I don't "own" two properties. I have mortgages on two properties. You're as bad as @UKIP.
Here is my letter to @Nigel_Farage. I wonder how many more lies they have told in this Election? > https://t.co/RFd6ePifIJ
@lobbygobblers It seems Leigh Tories want me to close office & leave another vacant shop in Leigh. If that's what you & they want, then fine
@lobbygobblers FYI: I pay £5k+ office rent. Like other non-profit services, we get reduced rate. If u think it's "posh", come & look round.
I recall @David_Cameron inviting us to judge his NHS re-organisation by effect on waiting lists. Now at a 6-year high with 3 million waiting
Only two words matter today. Vote Labour.
Just found out @UKIP have sent out a leaflet which includes straightforward lie about me. They are beneath contempt. Will be taking further.
“@graeme74dj: @BayTV_Liverpool I have not seen your penalty at Goodison, was it like a baines penalty?” > more Graham Stuart v Wimbledon
For all who donated to my Marathon run, here's where your money went. Can't thank you enough > http://t.co/Og5juyDc1H #EFC @BayTV_Liverpool
Big thanks to all who turned out at Goodison, esp @reid6peter & @JohnBishop100. Further £1000 raised for @WhizzKidz & EITC. Up the Toffees!
@AllezAllezEFC @reid6peter rolled back the years. Snods, on balance, didn't. But big Tony Warner stole show & came home to the "mother club"
“@Colin_Dolan: Amazing day playing for Everton @Goodison in "celebrity" charity match. Thanks @andyburnhammp for invite” > Great performance
At Lime St, heading home w/ magnificent trophy for beating @SteveRotheramMP's Reds. Open-top bus parade tomoro! COYB! http://t.co/QT7xgQhUS3

“@GregOK: @SteveRotheramMP @WhizzKidz @Everton what position are you Andy? I reckon midfield schemer” > prima donna striker, obviously!
10.30 tomorrow. Goodison. Everton v Liverpool. @andyburnhammp v @SteveRotheramMP. All in aid of @WhizzKidz & @Everton in Community. COYB!

A vote for UKIP is a vote for the privatisation of the NHS. Please RT to get the message out before Thursday. http://t.co/vLelMQPmov

Folly of Govt NHS reforms exposed in 1 ministerial tweet> “@normanlamb: I have condemned that decision on tariff which cannot be justified!”
Labour has warned Govt for months about growing crisis in mental health. Must reverse deep cuts in funding planned for this year. #r4today
“@Chrisgill95: Is it true @andyburnhammp you plan to bar Chang from sponsoring @everton if you get in government?” > No
@Johnedwarddiver They're not. Story in Mail is complete distortion of our public health policy. Not "forcing" anyone to do anything.
“@NikkiPixie70: A major concern is the threat that TTIP poses to the NHS. Would Labour fight to exempt the NHS from the TTIP clause?” > Yes.
So #NHS is being re-organised AGAIN. Now the Government wants GPs to commission GP services. Lansley's mess deepens > http://t.co/7eKb1zCpMg
10 concrete steps a @UKLabour government will take immediately to deal with the cost-of-living crisis: http://t.co/V6Kof41wSf
@uncleporkie You're welcome, & I wasn't making a political point. All parties bear responsibility for this minimum- wage, zero-hours system.
@uncleporkie I did. You may recall that I published a White Paper in 2010 called Building the National Care Service. https://t.co/Uz4deXDoco
We need a radical rethink of the way we care for older people. These abuses can't go on. Social care in England is a broken system.
@Lt_Woodpigeon I take all your points. But #indyref will affect my constituents & North as a whole. Surely we're entitled to our say on it?
High time that UKIP NHS policy came in for closer scrutiny - "the very existence of the NHS stifles competition" > http://t.co/Z5jqf1tEkd
Tories, Libs & UKIP all silent on this. Why? They want NHS exposed to global market. Vote Labour in May to protect it http://t.co/aJo1gv1t9q
@SPFLTrust: Visit from @andyburnhammp to hear abt @SPFLTrust Football Fans in Training. He was well impressed!> I was, great to meet you all
Moyes never does well away at the big clubs.
It's got harder to get a GP appointment under @David_Cameron. Nothing he's announced today will change that reality for millions of people.
Proof! http://t.co/OrKeUk8KiM

Truly inspired decision to begin #Hillsborough Inquests with the pen portraits. Reminder to us all how they were so much more than 'the 96'.
In Brussels to argue for exemption for #NHS from EU-US treaty. Tories, LDs, UKIP all silent on it. Updates later > http://t.co/TQI0ZUUvnZ
Proud to run #vlm2014 for Jacob https://t.co/qOPDcS38Cd & Dan http://t.co/V2fUiifD0F Let's help @WhizzKidz get these lads off waiting list!

1st full year after @David_Cameron's #NHS re-organisation has been worst year in decade in A&E. RT to let people know what he's doing to NHS
“@skyejromance: Can you guarantee Labour will NOT listen to Reform and others to intro NHS charges? Of any kind?” > Yes.
“@Gillespie1Alan: will @UKLabour reinstate the Sec Of State's duty to secure provision of health services when in Government?” > Yes we will
Thanks to Regency Glass for £500 for @WL_Hospice. Say they'll double if I beat @edballsmp. Feeling under more pressure than Moyes! #vlm2014
“@TommyTommytee18: making film to help Andy Burnham raise funds towards Leigh Hospice, WhizKids, Everton in Comunity”>Yer a great man Tommy!
Pleased to hear my good friends at George Elliot have prevailed in their fight against privatisation. Great campaign with @UKLabour support.
The problem with @David_Cameron's inheritance tax pledge is it won't benefit 95% of families now paying higher care charges under his Govt.
It is getting harder to get a GP appointment under @David_Cameron. 3 in 10 people now waiting more than a week > http://t.co/EhvY15L0kg

Pay cuts for nurses. Pay-offs for managers. That's @David_Cameron's #NHS > http://t.co/MG4SgMmMLz
Labour reveals number of people made redundant then re-hired after @David_Cameron NHS reorganisation has almost doubled (3950). What a waste
“@HillsboroughAnf: Congrats to @andyburnhammp running 16 miles from Leigh to Goodison.” > Cheers lads, sore tonight. Good luck with yours.

“@RoyalBlueStuey: @EvertonAllSorts how do we find the route he's taking” > straight down the Lancs, past Taxi Club, right down
@allanlewis2 Not entirely sure a half-time Chang & the 'legroom' in Lower Gwladys is best way to recover from 16-mile run, but there you go!
“@wirefun: @andyburnhammp best of luck, at you age too :)” > terrible what a mid-life crisis does to you. Hope you're well.
@JHowEFC08 doing too god bless him. @SteveRotheramMP & others joining. Look out for us struggling on the Lancs! http://t.co/hg1IhBo7xC #COYB
Today, I'm running to Goodison Park from home to get ready for @LondonMarathon supporting @Everton's pioneering work on dementia. 1/2
UK spends less than 10% of GDP on health. France, Germany, US all spend far more. Fundamentally wrong to claim #NHS is unsustainable. #bbcqt
Big pay-offs for managers; big pay day for Tory mates; pay cuts for nurses. That, in a nutshell, is Cameron's #NHS > http://t.co/pn5tsMObbA
.@David_Cameron is making #NHS staff pay the price for his mismanagement. £3BN re-organisation has left the NHS in weak financial position.
Crucial commitment from @Ed_Miliband today: "The next Labour government will work to make sure the NHS is protected from EU competition law"
“@pete_witty: @andyburnhammp Andy can you confirm if Labour get back in power in 2015 clause 119 would be removed? #Clause119” > Yes.
“@JohannaBaxter: If I had links to @edballsmp or @andyburnhammp donations pages I might sponsor them too *coughs*” > https://t.co/gkhIHfPjIG
After that answer, looks like Coalition are freezing nurses' pay. If so, that's a kick in the teeth for NHS staff.

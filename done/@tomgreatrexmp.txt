@robcrilly @BloomfieldSJ I have asked myself that question most weekends in the last year. Sat Apr 25 14:49:32 BST 2015
@fmeikle we can agree on that at least tonight. Fri Apr 24 00:28:52 BST 2015
@fmeikle my formative years in lower divs & when I got political in constant battle to stay alive & keep ground from property developers. Fri Apr 24 00:19:29 BST 2015
@fmeikle hell, yes as somebody may have said recently (but seems like years ago). Well done on title - we somehow stayed up. Fri Apr 24 00:12:23 BST 2015

@EdTech_Stories and sometimes agree to agree even if more often disagree Thu Apr 23 17:31:42 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories interesting stuff - in my limited understanding does seem to me that the echo chamber effect is big part of it. Thu Apr 23 17:21:05 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories which confirms not been a pay rise but reads like there has... Thu Apr 23 17:18:05 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories no wage rise - don't believe everything you read on social media. Thu Apr 23 16:33:35 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories know what you mean - no days off for a while leave me having to check which day of the week it is on occasion. Thu Apr 23 15:01:45 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories think you meant #GE2015 ? Or have I lost a year somewhere ? ;-) Thu Apr 23 14:36:39 BST 2015
@EdTech_Stories checked back -you contacted me & James Kelly. To avoid duplication, notes show he took up with school & explained at time? Thu Apr 23 11:53:31 BST 2015

@bcalderwood23 @1974Hamilton will try to do that Brian - where is yr shop ? Fri Apr 17 22:51:40 BST 2015
@bcalderwood23 my view is MP job to represent everybody in constituency & to support policies agree with, which parties stand 4 election on Fri Apr 17 22:40:43 BST 2015
@bcalderwood23 @1974Hamilton no I don't Brian. Quite opposite. Good to have debate & respect other opinions even (especially) when disagree Fri Apr 17 22:28:50 BST 2015
@bcalderwood23 nor I with you Brian. Parties have diff policies but all have process to set party policy, so all parties have "party line" Fri Apr 17 22:21:55 BST 2015
@bcalderwood23 you do know what SNP conf passed re their MPs being unable to disagree or criticise in public don't you Brian? Fri Apr 17 22:00:35 BST 2015

@AntiFrackingSCO not being rude but also have to go now Sat Feb 21 17:02:40 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO because no conditions attached & so wouldn't address gaps. Nobody has permission to extract shale anywhere in UK Sat Feb 21 17:02:13 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO short pause with no conditions does nothing to address regulatory gaps Sat Feb 21 16:57:45 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO MER about offshore & implementation of Wood Review. Critically important for North Sea given collapse of oil price. Sat Feb 21 16:46:34 GMT 2015

@AntiFrackingSCO in Eng we pushed for regn to be satisfied before fracking can happen, & some of that in law & after Lords Amdts some 1/2 Sat Feb 21 16:27:00 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO as you know planning devolved & have said in scot stop until devolved regs in place, learnt from elsewhere & local vote 2/2 Sat Feb 21 16:23:03 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO our position is no fracking unless robust regulation, comprehensive monitoring & local consent - has been for 3 yrs but 1/2 Sat Feb 21 16:21:27 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO @PoliticsScot because it was for 18 months & no conditions - our amdt more comprehensive & stopped fracking until in place. Sat Feb 21 16:19:56 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO @PoliticsScot you are wrong. Act doesn't apply to NI, & most doesn't apply to Scot. Planning & env permit always devolved. Sat Feb 21 16:18:37 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO Underground mineral access rights now effectively devolved but always secondary to always devolved planning. Sat Feb 21 16:09:53 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO very few PEDL licenses in scotland and none have permission to frack - so if want no fracking then can block Sat Feb 21 16:07:54 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO so Scot gvt always could use planning to stop, just wanted to make it appear as they had no choice. Sat Feb 21 16:06:24 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO license doesn't give you permission to do any exploratory drilling or extraction. Need planning & env permits Sat Feb 21 16:05:07 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO no it wouldn't - geothermal heat recovery would have been but not underground coal gasification. Sat Feb 21 15:59:11 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO they claimed exactly that - Mike Weir on GMS on 26 Jan. Sat Feb 21 15:56:48 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot @AntiFrackingSCO no it wouldn't - UCG not covered by provisions of infrastructure bill. Entirely matter for Scot gvt as u know Sat Feb 21 15:55:51 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO have you asked why SNP claimed didn't have powers to block 24 hours before they disproved themselves ? Sat Feb 21 15:50:34 GMT 2015
@AntiFrackingSCO that's not fracking though, is it ? Sat Feb 21 15:48:39 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot not as good as what commons passed - reason I forced to vote. But until regs in place stops fracking in E&W. scot is devolved Sat Feb 21 13:47:16 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot second legsln by 31 July (so next gvt will define) but no fracking until in place & then have to meet conditions. 2/2 Sat Feb 21 12:44:37 GMT 2015
@PoliticsScot not true. Argued should have kept as commons passed. But lords included most of it - 2 bits now have to be defined in 1/2 Sat Feb 21 12:41:53 GMT 2015

@David_Ross86 @PoliticalYeti not any more. Thu Feb 12 22:15:06 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 @Jankrobatti more public funding per head in Scotland than any part of England or Wales. As you know. Thu Feb 12 21:51:50 GMT 2015
“@David_Ross86: You meant nothing to me. @tomgreatrexmp @PoliticalYeti”> as somebody else from Cambuslang once hollered #Viieeennnnaaa Thu Feb 12 21:47:34 GMT 2015

@Susancalder4 @Jankrobatti 1. How can rest of UK do so much better? 2. You do know what's been devolved in 2012 Scotland Act, I take it? Thu Feb 12 21:34:32 GMT 2015

@AngryWeegie @Granval04 I'll pass that on too. Thu Feb 12 18:06:26 GMT 2015
@Granval04 and that's the SNP response to a failing A&E service locally ? Thanks for that - will pass on to constituents affected. Thu Feb 12 16:52:37 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie  @RuglenReformer the OBR charter doesn't commit to any Tory spending or tax plans. £30b figure SNP lie - as you know. Thu Feb 12 16:36:56 GMT 2015
@roseannmcinty15 @AngryWeegie @RuglenReformer no I didn't. And you have record underspend to allocate. As you know. Thu Feb 12 13:10:00 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie @RuglenReformer I'll be sure to pass on to constituents your dismissal on behalf of SNP of what is happening in A&E Wed Feb 11 17:17:23 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie @RuglenReformer wrong again - £100m extra what asked for - £383m just allocation of NHS Barnett consequentials. Check yr facts Wed Feb 11 17:14:32 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 not to Lanarkshire hospitals yet though ? Wed Feb 11 12:31:33 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 it has - been mainstay of my surgeries for several weeks now. Wed Feb 11 11:57:03 GMT 2015
My latest column for the @RuglenReformer - a crisis in Scotland's NHS that needs urgently addressed http://t.co/ATmc3IGagc Wed Feb 11 11:22:42 GMT 2015
@FrackFreeWales article inaccurate - jones didnt seek 2 put our changes back. If gvt doesn't accept our commons amdts will oppose when back. Wed Feb 11 08:41:55 GMT 2015
@KenMcHAbz @chrisdeerin @CairneyPaul and how much of our gas currently comes from Russia Ken ? Wed Feb 11 06:49:42 GMT 2015
@chrisdeerin @CairneyPaul who likes Russia, Chris? (missed this tweet earlier this week) Wed Feb 11 06:45:44 GMT 2015
@CairneyPaul http://t.co/ne7sQ1Q2C8 & http://t.co/CRVUJl65UD & re Scotland http://t.co/0JbqFmmIEb - happy to discuss further Wed Feb 11 06:45:00 GMT 2015
@CairneyPaul sorry Paul missed this - not without robust regulation, comprehensive monitoring & local consent. Been arguing case for 3yrs Wed Feb 11 06:41:13 GMT 2015
.@spgthatsme Scot gvt should take seriously - this is what happening again& again in A&Es now. Denial or dismissing is dereliction of duty. Tue Feb 10 23:51:05 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 indeed - so hope she changes attitude from last week where denied problems & dismissed concerns & refusal to publish weekly figs Tue Feb 10 23:50:52 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 I did - always represent constituents to NHS when come to me for assistance. You may mock but lots of A&E cases in recent months. Tue Feb 10 23:12:36 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex maybe but suspect most would have more respect if acknowledge realities then seek to deal with them. Tue Feb 10 23:10:12 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 moving people at 3h55 but not seeing clinician for 8hrs is playing games with sick to meet target & shouldn't happen in Scotland. Tue Feb 10 23:07:11 GMT 2015
.@RobAllan4 think you'll find he was replaced months ago with S Robison - maybe his & Sturgeon legacy as previous health ministers though. Tue Feb 10 22:57:45 GMT 2015
@cashley_ade thanks - I'll pass on 2 constituents considered view of SNP supporter is 2 ridicule the A&E problems & spout trivial nonsense Tue Feb 10 22:54:06 GMT 2015
@RobAllan4 not for my constituents using Lanarkshire A&E facilities they are not - getting worse week by week and SNP Ministers deny reality Tue Feb 10 22:47:31 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex it would be much better to acknowledge & deal with it. They get weekly perf stats from NHS boards but refuse to publish Tue Feb 10 22:45:38 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex over last few months had several cases at surgeries like this. Appalling that scot gvt spend so long trying to deny problem Tue Feb 10 22:38:19 GMT 2015
.@RobAllan4 out of date figs & no comfort to constituents moved to holding area after 3h55 to meet target but wait 8hrs to be seen by medic Tue Feb 10 22:35:17 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex get cases most weeks - elderly constituent moved after 3h55 to meet target but 8hrs to be seen. And sadly not isolated case Tue Feb 10 22:33:11 GMT 2015
@PotterMontrose you think acceptable 4 elderly constituent wait at A&E 8 hrs, moved 2 holding area after 3h55 to meet target, but not seen ? Tue Feb 10 22:31:33 GMT 2015
Long waiting times Lanarkshire A&Es raised at my surgeries 4 months - in Paisley SNP ministers cant ignore any longer http://t.co/2kXLIikq66 Tue Feb 10 22:23:30 GMT 2015
@David_Ross86 doing podcast with your bearded friend tomorrow - will make sure he knows how a little bit of happiness returned for you today Tue Feb 10 20:36:00 GMT 2015
@ailsa_comrie I did. It's a great place and will be back again (without camera crews) soon Tue Feb 10 19:23:34 GMT 2015
@paulhutcheon alternatively could go shoe shopping with me & 2 five year olds this weekend - wouldn't be silent though. Tue Feb 10 19:13:08 GMT 2015
@StephenWatt74 @JamesKLabMSP I did, thanks. Great venue. Will make sure pop back in soon (without the snappers) Tue Feb 10 18:30:48 GMT 2015
@BrianDeazeley @paulhutcheon took it to mean no of stop/searches per head of population compared. X/1000 in each area. Tue Feb 10 15:53:06 GMT 2015
“@paulhutcheon: Stop & search policy: frisk levels proportionately 9 x higher in Scotland than area covered by New York Police Dept” > wow. Tue Feb 10 14:36:08 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti I'm very grateful for your assistance today Hugh, will come in useful but don't think I'll be taking you up on that kind offer. Tue Feb 10 13:23:44 GMT 2015
@NoYouMeanFewer I did indeed. Thanks. Tue Feb 10 13:18:59 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti your tweet will suffice, thanks. Tue Feb 10 13:18:11 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti thanks again Tue Feb 10 13:13:55 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti thanks for that. Will be sure to pass yr tweet on to constituents that it is all in their heads & no problems with A&E in Scot Tue Feb 10 13:09:40 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti @Susancalder4 8 yrs SNP gov been in power, & childcare costs gone up & gap grown with rest of UK throughout that time. Tue Feb 10 12:54:20 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 @Jankrobatti I am interested - especially when more expensive & less places for my constituents than other parts of UK. Tue Feb 10 12:52:48 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 & your assertion that pay lower in England & that's why childcare less expensive than Scotland is utterly without foundation. Tue Feb 10 12:50:03 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti @Susancalder4 still waiting for yr explanation why SNP gvt has let childcare situation get so bad here compared to rest of UK Tue Feb 10 08:52:26 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti @Susancalder4 so no answer then on devolved policy scot gvt has seen get worse every yr and worse than every other part of UK? Tue Feb 10 00:19:55 GMT 2015
@debbiegee41 @Susancalder4 no I didn't - OBR charter not vote for Tory plans. As you know. Repeating falsehood doesn't make it true. Tue Feb 10 00:09:30 GMT 2015
@Macaulich can you explain why childcare (always devolved) so much more expensive and less available here than in rest of UK ? Tue Feb 10 00:02:19 GMT 2015
@Jankrobatti @Susancalder4 so no answer to why completely devolved policy so much worse in Scotland than every other part of UK then Mon Feb 09 23:59:07 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 so why does every other part of UK do so much better now ? While gap in cost & places gets wider for parents in Scotland alone Mon Feb 09 23:53:23 GMT 2015
@SiobhanSynnot I'd watch out for that Alan Roden if I were you Mon Feb 09 23:46:23 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 try checking wage rates for childcare workers - higher in London and South East, otherwise same across UK. So what is reason? Mon Feb 09 23:43:05 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4  my answer is for scot gvt to do job & improve situation where we are worse off than every other part of UK & policy devolved. Mon Feb 09 23:37:54 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 you could try explaining why done so little. But you won't. Because you can't. People expect better from devolved gvt. Mon Feb 09 23:34:22 GMT 2015
@SiobhanSynnot good to hear. Good luck with new job. Mon Feb 09 23:32:49 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 so why does every other part of UK do so much better ? Why not a priority since 2007 including yrs when budget increasing? Mon Feb 09 23:30:54 GMT 2015
@chrisdeerin capacity there about 10k I think - only empty seats in stand home fans in. It was also very cold. Mon Feb 09 23:25:24 GMT 2015
@Susancalder4 it's always been devolved - appalling got so much worse in last few yrs yet with all relevant powers scot gvt not interested. Mon Feb 09 23:22:12 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie most recent annual survey - and why so much worse in Scotland? It is appalling sitn and SNP in office & could fix if bothered. Mon Feb 09 23:18:29 GMT 2015
@chrisdeerin went to see same two teams at Christmas - about 9k in same ground (3 sides full with away fans plus me as neutral) Mon Feb 09 23:13:24 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie childcare costs more and fewer places in Scotland than England. For worse under SNP, not better http://t.co/v1nXoPu3xw Mon Feb 09 22:55:23 GMT 2015
@SiobhanSynnot shame - I mostly bought your (former) paper for reviews. Hope you'll still be doing some film in Mail Mon Feb 09 22:39:06 GMT 2015
@mracattack looking forward to it actually. Mon Feb 09 18:13:51 GMT 2015
@LindaHurrell @DArcyTiP not unclear - been same for 3 yrs! Robust regulation, comprehensive monitoring & local consent before any activity. Mon Feb 09 18:13:20 GMT 2015
@mracattack no. Vote for OBR charter not same as Tory plans. Just because you keep repeating it doesn't make it true. Mon Feb 09 17:45:26 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie try again - cost of childcare higher and no of places less in Scotland. And it has been under SNP control since 2007. Mon Feb 09 17:44:08 GMT 2015
@cagneyspal Colin you can read my timeline and see plenty of info on policies. Happy to discuss any you want more info on Mon Feb 09 16:37:31 GMT 2015
@LindaHurrell @DArcyTiP position is as was when gvt accepted amdt & will press when this comes back to commons. False to suggest otherwise Mon Feb 09 16:36:19 GMT 2015
I only ever tried a selfie the once. Was awful. Never again. Then end up nominated 4 selfie of year @Awards_Politics  http://t.co/o607rF1G6r Mon Feb 09 13:43:00 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie worse in Scotland than every other part of the UK. Less places and more expensive - pleased they are finally waking up to it. Mon Feb 09 12:38:35 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie  been in power 8 yrs. Why haven't done this already in scotland - always been devolved ? Most expensive childcare in UK is Scot Mon Feb 09 11:48:29 GMT 2015
@CairneyPaul with heat much more difficult to not use gas even in medium term - q is then where do get gas will need from? Mon Feb 09 11:24:25 GMT 2015
@ConorMcGinn congratulations Conor Mon Feb 09 10:01:01 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 that's not about Plt though, is it? Check judgement  Salmond & Swinney with RBS/ABN AMRO bid & Salmond wanted to cut regulation. Mon Feb 09 08:32:07 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 see value in ability to redistribute within UK according to need & political priority & some things work better joined up Mon Feb 09 08:19:26 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP no, just interested why that makes such a difference in your eyes Mon Feb 09 00:11:36 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP why does it matter that I went to university in England exactly ? Mon Feb 09 00:06:25 GMT 2015
@CairneyPaul problem with this, as with much of debate, is incomplete focus on electricity generation. Lots of gas is for heat, not power. Sun Feb 08 23:44:20 GMT 2015
@mac_rhona @Margaret_Curran @William_Bain @JimSheridanMP @charles_kennedy wrong as in inaccurate as in erroneous - possibly intentionally. Sun Feb 08 22:02:27 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 & as we discussed previously more decentralised power what believe needs 2 happen. Diff is I think can & should do as part of UK. Sun Feb 08 19:57:50 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 lots of MPs I disagree with & lots aspects of Plt frustrating - but same in every democracy. Talk 2 Lab sister party Norway etc Sun Feb 08 19:43:37 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 get leaving UK more important than all else to you. But at gen elex voting SNP in Labour constituency only helps Tories stay in. Sun Feb 08 19:35:18 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 you obviously didn't read 2010 manifesto then if you think more right than 2005 - & just ignore 2015 policies. Sun Feb 08 16:30:14 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 50p tax, bankers bonus, mansion tax, NHS funding, energy reform, devolution in Eng, NMW increase, living wage, 0 hrs - not same. Sun Feb 08 16:11:42 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex you & me both. Q is what is best way of dealing at gen elex - not same as referendum choice. but let's continue by email.. Sun Feb 08 15:30:14 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex thanks - trying to catch up with inbox this afternoon & evening, so will get back to you. Sun Feb 08 15:18:00 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex if you want to discuss more detail pls DM me and can have fuller conv than can with 140 chars exchange. Sun Feb 08 15:06:40 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex & don't believe propoganda - did not vote for Tory plans on tax/spending but OBR charter to balance current budget over Plt Sun Feb 08 15:05:40 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex best way to tackle deficit is invest in infrastructure, create jobs & increase tax take & reduce welfare bill as result. Sun Feb 08 15:04:23 GMT 2015
@Elizabeth_Annex why this election is about uk policies - energy prices, reverse millionaire tax cut, mansion tax for NHS, tackle tax havens Sun Feb 08 14:54:49 GMT 2015

@cjacko1 it is just a fact - voting SNP against Labour only helps Tories chance of staying in office. Which some may want, but many don't. Sun Feb 08 14:22:58 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie more seats win, more chance you have of forming gvt. And 41/59 in Scot, voting SNP only helps Tory gvt stay in. You know that. Sun Feb 08 14:19:56 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP hatred is a destructive and corrosive force, in politics or more generally. Not part of my politics. Sun Feb 08 14:17:33 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP just wrong. Voting SNP in GE in 41/59 utterly self defeating - unless what you really want is 5 more years of Tory gvt Sun Feb 08 11:30:07 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP it does - difference between Labour or Tory being largest party. You know that. Sun Feb 08 11:27:29 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP we are governed by SNP on health, education, police & more. And 89 days from choice of Tory or Lab gvt in UK. Sun Feb 08 11:23:22 GMT 2015
@MHossack @JimHood_MP statement of fact - in 41/59 constituencies voting SNP only helps Tories keep power. You know that too. Sun Feb 08 11:16:53 GMT 2015
@cjacko1 you know inescapable fact SNP vote in 41 constituencies only helps Tories & works against Lab being largest party & leading gvt Sun Feb 08 11:15:23 GMT 2015

@PJL1971 or alternatively get train from Motherwell to Cambuslang & Rutherglen to leave 5 mins after sleeper rather than 5 mins before... Sat Feb 07 19:29:16 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 @AngusMacNeilMP now if you could get them to stop at Cambuslang on way into Glasgow...;-) Sat Feb 07 19:24:34 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 @AngusMacNeilMP look forward to new stock being introduced. Use sleeper fair amount now but struggle to get much sleep. Sat Feb 07 19:23:00 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 @AngusMacNeilMP sorry - become a bit of an anorak about power generation over last few years. Sat Feb 07 19:19:18 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 @AngusMacNeilMP and from 2018 how will power be generated ? Sat Feb 07 19:11:40 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 @AngusMacNeilMP told me about that - doesn't always work though Sat Feb 07 19:00:23 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 thanks. Sat Feb 07 18:57:48 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 btw when will know what facilities new sleeper rolling stock will have? Thinking power points and wifi mainly... Sat Feb 07 18:35:39 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 yes a new one on me - makes a change from the TLAs both your world and mine are littered with. Sat Feb 07 18:26:47 GMT 2015
@docsuzy @clydegateway @BFI yep, it is a great facility and love that is so full of history too. Sat Feb 07 17:58:07 GMT 2015
@docsuzy  @clydegateway  helped get great @BFI Scottish film archive in Bridgeton Olympia - but wld b nice 2 have screen this side of river. Sat Feb 07 16:02:08 GMT 2015
@docsuzy @glasgowfilm if I ever get back that way will have to visit. Sat Feb 07 15:50:17 GMT 2015
@docsuzy @glasgowfilm looks impressive - how long has it been there? Don't remember it last time was in Lerwick. Then again, that was 2008. Sat Feb 07 15:45:00 GMT 2015
@docsuzy much as I love @glasgowfilm & like vue #hamilton - would love to be able to see a movie closer to home. Sat Feb 07 15:31:15 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 the term used to me on Friday was 'hibernated' - nothing certain but some hope may be back on cards again. Sat Feb 07 15:29:04 GMT 2015
@PJL1971 hear that the idea of cinema by j2 of M74 abandoned a few yrs ago may be back in the offing... Sat Feb 07 15:25:08 GMT 2015
Great photo exhibition in #Rutherglen library of old cinemas in Burgh. Sadly all gone now - would love it if could get one back here Sat Feb 07 15:19:47 GMT 2015
Monthly surgeries this morning - 9.30 Rutherglen library, 11.00 Cambuslang Gate, 12.00 Burnbank Library - no appointment necessary. Sat Feb 07 08:57:40 GMT 2015

@scott993 well done Scott - know plenty of folk from all parts of UK who will be rooting for you. Fri Feb 06 23:12:31 GMT 2015
Thanks to all for fantastic support at #GE2015 campaign launch in #Cambuslang tonight @scottishlabour http://t.co/00aFZgAJlD Fri Feb 06 22:11:18 GMT 2015
@mac_rhona @Margaret_Curran @William_Bain @JimSheridanMP @charles_kennedy suggest Ecologist writers learn about Plty procedure - it is wrong Fri Feb 06 21:21:17 GMT 2015
Good to catch up Ian Manson & @clydegateway team at impressive new Rutherglen Links building - w. Cllr Denis McKenna http://t.co/Cw0Yec78zr Fri Feb 06 14:23:17 GMT 2015
@Sam29Preston debated in the Lords on Monday Fri Feb 06 14:19:26 GMT 2015
@steve5424 great to hear. Must be a huge relief, keep safe. Fri Feb 06 00:04:49 GMT 2015
@steve5424 any news of your mum ? Have RT-ed but DM me if anything can do to help. Thu Feb 05 21:21:33 GMT 2015
@b_airlie we may disagree about same sex marriage but your statement is ridiculous & wrong. Thu Feb 05 18:24:20 GMT 2015
@AlistairDutton good to meet you too - will see you on Sunday in Rutherglen. Thu Feb 05 18:12:58 GMT 2015

Govt must follow through on commitment to engage with workforce at Sellafield - I questioned @EdwardDaveyMP this morn http://t.co/c7T2A9IoDM Thu Feb 05 10:33:28 GMT 2015
At @sciaf 50th anniversary first commemorative event tonight - Archbishop Cushley reminding us started in #Rutherglen in 1965. Wed Feb 04 20:25:14 GMT 2015
@mlynch1888 they spent months saying they couldn't use devolved powers to block - then when couldn't pretend it was UK any more, they did. Wed Feb 04 11:51:42 GMT 2015
@mlynch1888 more here http://t.co/ycI1puWGQz Wed Feb 04 11:32:28 GMT 2015
@mlynch1888 my amdt stops it until 13 conditions met - gvt gave in when realised going 2 lose vote. Better than short pause &no conditions. Wed Feb 04 11:30:16 GMT 2015
@AngryWeegie @neilfinlayson it's what Andy Scott's evidence  says - doesn't seem 2have been misrepresented. Seems heavy handed approach 2 me Tue Feb 03 14:40:55 GMT 2015
@Liquidator_ agree with that and so think should have clinical trial to inform decision like that being asked to take today. Is my view. Tue Feb 03 14:29:29 GMT 2015
@Liquidator_ so trial it clinically first then. Isn't that best approach to take given it hasn't been trialled anywhere in world yet ? Tue Feb 03 12:52:39 GMT 2015
@FraserStewart7 approx 10% of what raises - given distribution of relevant properties, more than would be raised doing same in Scot alone Tue Feb 03 12:50:41 GMT 2015
@FraserStewart7 not true - I proposed amdt which forced a vote on last wk (nc2). But lost that vote Tue Feb 03 10:51:13 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour that's where we disagree - & simply not possible with full fiscal autonomy = end of Barnett & redistributive mech Tue Feb 03 10:49:56 GMT 2015
@FraserStewart7 Barnett consequential up to scot gvt to allocate. Jim said how would use that addition £ mostly raised outwith Scotland. Tue Feb 03 10:48:11 GMT 2015
@Liquidator_ yes, understand that. But hasn't been trialled clinically anywhere yet . Should decide after then not before  why am anxious. Tue Feb 03 10:45:35 GMT 2015
@Liquidator_ very uneasy about this especially ahead of any clinical trial (don't agree on slippery slope argument though). Minded to oppose Tue Feb 03 10:22:04 GMT 2015
@Aunty_Fracker no we're not. No apologies from me in ensuring proper safeguards & regulation in place as pre-requisite, which gvt now accept Tue Feb 03 09:44:12 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour pooling, sharing & redistributing while decentralising power to & in each constituent part is my preferred model Tue Feb 03 09:09:21 GMT 2015
@Aunty_Fracker dear auntie, I know you are easily confused but shale is not a silver bullet. Now eat your porridge before it gets cold. Tue Feb 03 08:48:06 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour sorry but that doesn't make sense. Michael Foot no nationalist, believed in solidarity across all parts of UK. Tue Feb 03 08:43:49 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour tax is on properties of value above £2m Tue Feb 03 08:41:03 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour & mansion tax policy is exactly that - 95% affected properties in London & SE. Redistribute to other parts of UK Tue Feb 03 07:23:26 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour full fiscal autonomy means lose Barnett means lose protection of sudden revenue decline from dominant sector. Tue Feb 03 07:21:37 GMT 2015
Missed this from @BrianWilson1967 in @TheScotsman at weekend http://t.co/jxMtSWx6GQ - has it really come to this ? Mon Feb 02 21:36:42 GMT 2015
@cmcc4hi11 @scottishlabour because that or full fiscal autonomy prevents pooling, sharing & redistribution across UK Mon Feb 02 19:56:19 GMT 2015
@DavoMc82 for those that can, helping into work is right. Not same as hounding those who can't http://t.co/hJj2F70Ivl Mon Feb 02 08:35:18 GMT 2015
@DavoMc82 tell me how SFT isn't PFI? I don't vilify people on benefits - lazy generalisation of you to state so. Mon Feb 02 08:28:06 GMT 2015
@DavoMc82 wrong - against 50p tax rate, mansion tax, challenging energy cos, living wage 4 contractors, bus re-regulation & pro corp tax cut Mon Feb 02 08:04:02 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp take a good book - you may be there some time. Sun Feb 01 15:54:44 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp you realise we are in danger of agreeing three times in an afternoon? :-) Sun Feb 01 15:48:07 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp indeed - why needs nurtured & real problems fixed, not ministers defensively assuming & asserting it's just politics. Sun Feb 01 15:42:18 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp need to sort OOH/A&E . Problems there long time, got worse last 5 yrs - Scot gvt of any party needs take seriously. Sun Feb 01 15:24:51 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp wait 6hrs+ be seen after moved to meet 4hr target. Used to work OOH service but hard to discuss in 140 char xchanges Sun Feb 01 14:42:13 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp but agree several factors - lack of clinical staff & lack of confidence in Lanarkshire OOH services significant too. Sun Feb 01 14:03:12 GMT 2015
@ish_bro @kdugdalemsp already happens - patients moved from one area to another at 3h50mins to claim met target. Overall wait often 6hrs+ Sun Feb 01 14:02:21 GMT 2015

@teuchtermac don't know - perhaps you should ask them.
@teuchtermac & Scot gvt planning guidance could stop altogether if wanted. Choose not to (they may be right) but it is Holyrood decision.
@james170969 just not the ones who decide Scot gvt policy, some of whom try to pretend being foisted on Scotland when they could ban if want
@terrympaul maybe, but it looked like Italian to me. @martinmccluskey says going through various languages earlier apparently.
Anybody know why roadside warning signs on Westminster Bridge advising ppl not to gamble illegally in Italian ?
@teuchtermac not according to Scot gvt planning guidance published in June - but can already ban outright if want to http://t.co/B0ajOWT8uw
@james170969 licenses don't give permission - entirely up 2 Sco gvt. If want to ban, already can. Don't seem want to http://t.co/B0ajOWT8uw

@Em_Brouhaha chaos caused mostly by acceleration of migration from IB and ignoring problems highlighted in pilots. Concern & anger genuine.
@Jodatu thanks John - agree much of that, tho many GPs etc don't want provide evid. & why re-test those with prog conditions after in SG ?
@Jodatu @ladygayle13 & Grayling ignoring IB migration pilots - showed up probs, but accelerated rollout anyway. End result hounds not helps.
@ladygayle13 & this needs changed for all UK not used as constitution fight. Why need lab uk gvt. Off to bed now, early start g'night 2/2
@ladygayle13 get yr point but remember acceleration this gvt not last. And how can be 2 little 2 l8 when policy from oppn 4 next elex? 1/2
@ladygayle13 some of us have been & influenced policy now - me, since became aware of issue 4 yrs ago. Needs to change & we will if elected.
@ladygayle13 IB migration where cause of chaos - & Grayling ignored pilots which showed up probs to accelerate - we wouldn't have done.
@Tanni_GT why still re-test people with Parkinson's, MS, MND after found not fit for work ? Waste of time & causes needless further distress
@ladygayle13 didn't stop her giving contract after contract to Atos in NHS, occ health for Scot gov etc. when she could've made example.
@ladygayle13 have been critic of this for 4 yrs+ & assessment needs overhaul = our policy and has been for more than 1 yr.

@chrislittlecott @drgrist reads like that is what contemplating along with compensation for shutdowns - interesting state aid implications?
@chrislittlecott @drgrist read earlier this week Austrian power emissions higher now than 1990s - is that because type of coal burning ?
@drgrist @chrislittlecott interesting move towards capacity market. Still makes accelerated nuclear shutdown look like odd decision, though.

@UnisonDave @johnmcternan 8 of 464 between 2001 (first post-devolution Plt) & late 2013 (when HoC lib. collated research) - England only.

@fmeikle @reporterboy it is exactly the reason why England constit qs need more thorough examination. EV4EL doesn't deal with real issue.
@cmcc4hi11 lots of confusion, understand how caused, so important to clarify. Hope to speak in debate 1st wk Plt back on this (w/c 13 Oct)
@cmcc4hi11 no that's incorrect. Smith process distinct.
@cmcc4hi11 does not affect Smith work. Some got 2 processes confused y'day with all else happening. Debate in wk Plt back after confs. 2/2
@cmcc4hi11 distinct process Smith appointed to oversee to meet timescale pledged on further dev to Holyrood. So diff views re Eng (1/2)
Good luck to Kit Symons this afternoon @FulhamFC #ffc
@Kevod1967 at least 10 surgeries a month plus doorstep surgeries & coffee morning format meetings. Email & my office can send on times/dates
@Gurjeet__ motion published yesterday - debate first week Parliament returns after conferences (2nd wk in October).
@cadogansexpert was important to clarify given some of commentary  - think genuine confusion from media caused partly by sleep deprivation.
@gorfra but all parties must focus on pressing issues neglected during long refcampaign - many where powers already reside in Holyrood (3/3)
@gorfra there are also wider uk constitutional issues to consider - but Holyrood proposals not dependent on that to progress. (2/3)
@gorfra the Smith process re Holyrood tax, welfare as per 3 parties proposals is  as per timescale promised. Command paper by end Oct (1/2)
@cadogansexpert @JamesKLabMSP & once SNP leadership sorted, hope time all focus on other pressing issues neglected during long ref cpgn 2/2)
@cadogansexpert @JamesKLabMSP agree & also decentralising power in Scotland big challenge for all in Holyrood to get to grips with (1/2)
@gorfra no and nor should it. Most of what seen confusion between 2 distinct processes.
@Iainllhendo that's process L Smith appointed to oversee and drive. Debate when Plt back then command paper end Oct is my understanding.
@gorfra no. Process as set out, Lab signed up, L. Smith overseeing. Noise about approach re England, but Smith process distinct & separate.
@fmeikle @reporterboy @Labourpaul 8
reality is that now West Cardiff, West Belfast & even West Ealing question too. Decentralisation in England has to be part of future UK.
@PaulSammo_Ig4b @reporterboy @Labourpaul 8
.@reporterboy @Labourpaul there were 464 bills introduced in Plt between 2001 (first post-Devo Plt) and 2013 - guess how many English only ?
@AndrewWilsonAJW @scotonsunday how decentralisation of power within Scotland has to be purpose of devolution, not as proxy to re-fight ref
@rushrush37 he is signed up to Smith led process re devolution to Holyrood. Reports wrong. It's separate bit on English votes where diff.
@jddundee the reports are wrong.
@jddundee not the case - it is the Cabinet cttee bit on English votes there is not agreement, the powers to Holyrood is as per before.
@SharonV777 @ReBrutha although Holyrood elex use form of prop rep and turnout  around 10% lower than UK gen elex (2010 comp 2011) ?
Remarkable turnout tells us whatever result, we all have responsibility to try to nurture engagement in politics that is possible #indyref
@AndrewWilsonAJW & thanks for bringing me news I may otherwise have missed in magnitude of today.
Good coach with great youths - deserves a chance to stop the damage caused by Magath's crazy decisions. Still tough call @AndrewWilsonAJW
@stubryant @sberrycoughband 3/3 & doesn't matter if folded or not - as long as goes into box.
@stubryant @sberrycoughband all votes should be put in ballot box & what everybody told at polling places.
@stubryant @sberrycoughband spoken to election office. Say 1 voter misunderstood request not fold ballot paper before putting IN box (1/2)
@stubryant @sberrycoughband thanks - will raise with elections office now to investigate. Will come back when get response.
@sberrycoughband thanks - have tweeted again. If you do hear where let me know and can raise - never heard before & don't think correct
@sberrycoughband @stubryant thanks - do you know which polling station ? Not heard this anywhere else. Can't raise elections office without
@sberrycoughband which polling station? - can't raise with elections office without specific. Yes or no, ballot papers must go into box.
@sberrycoughband @vonny_bravo @Shiny02 asked around. Some told to fold, some not - but all to put in ballot box. Where have said put on top?
@vonny_bravo which polling place ?
@sberrycoughband which polling place and who said it ?
@sberrycoughband who by? When I voted this morning told to fold and put in box. If concern, should raise with elections office at SLC
@SavoRFC sorry but read tweet as directed to council not me. If you want me to take up pls email with details tom.greatrex.mp@parliament.uk
@ianssmart @davieclegg http://t.co/5EyukQGZvm these ones ?
@MHossack @HappyJackYes we differ on that - doesn't matter to me where somebody is from.
@HappyJackYes campaign is about nationalism my point - people's reasons for voting for nationalist proposition mixed.
@MHossack @HappyJackYes what is your definition of "ain folk" ? Sounds like you making assumptions abt my background because born in south.
@HappyJackYes I've spoken to thousands of no voters, don't knows, won't vote & yes over last few months. Various reasons for votes discussed
@MHossack @HappyJackYes so why the question about Scottish candidate ? Lived here long b4 selected. Don't take anything/anybody for granted.
@iquoth @MarkSedd0n @chunkymark fair enough, I disagree & our votes tomorrow determine what next. Either way, need push for social justice.
@MHossack @HappyJackYes *what* definition I meant
@MHossack @HappyJackYes and wage definition of Scottish are you using ?
@MHossack @HappyJackYes lived in Scotland most of working life, married to Scot in Scotland & family born here. Like thousands of others.
@MHossack @HappyJackYes no, I live here. Like lots of other people born and/or grew up elsewhere.
@MHossack @HappyJackYes because I was born somewhere else ? Or have I misunderstood your point.
@MHossack @HappyJackYes & being born near east Kent coalfield relevant how?
@MHossack @HappyJackYes @chunkymark I live here, kids go to school here - like everybody else. Just don't agree leaving UK is way to improve
@HappyJackYes with respect, I do. All have to make judgement whether devolution in UK or leaving UK best. Diff views amongst constituents.
@HappyJackYes I will vote no tomorrow because I believe in solidarity and nationalism leaves me cold. On Friday we'll both still be here.
@chunkymark it is completely about nationalism.

Congratulations to NHS worker @lizmcshane selected to fight Heywood & Middleton for @uklabour - will be down to join campaign soon.

@SkyAnushka interesting - hardly any on thousands of doors here. Lots of dubious claims on social media from those appear always been SNP
@SkyAnushka where ?
@aaronmcguigan @richardosman @gerrypimm game v Blackburn at Loftus Rd only time left more than 2 mins early. If going, sat may've be 2nd.
@euanmccolm looking forward to Stewart Hosie's blog tomorrow.
@PoliticalYeti do you want smiling tips ? That pic of you on promo for #skypapers looked as miserable as if @David_Ross86 was in yr office.
“@gerrypimm: @gphb  @richardosman I'm getting boring but David Lloyd has carried our voice for 26 years and should be our rep imo” > agreed
@gerrypimm @UofEHL @richardosman if that is plan seems like hasn't worked out how.
@ianssmart sadly a modicum of decency & respect seems beyond many who should know better the last (& next?) few days & lost all judgement.
@richardosman @gerrypimm but won't happen until owner realises how many feel that - needs home game 2 get message across so can't be ignored
@gerrypimm @richardosman one more at home I suspect. If no win midweek or Sat and fans vocal, can't see lasting much longer.
@richardosman get the feeling next weekend will be key
As long as it's not a 2 year plus wait to cast the vote. And for that one I'd be a yes @richardosman
@sg_scotlabour 8/10 - it's those multi-choice date qs that did for me.

@cadogansexpert & best way to make most of renewables through pooled uk support which benefits us here as 90% of payment comes from rUK
@JohnnyboyWelwyn @acciesfc @scottsas I doubt it but we will know soon enough.
@titch1982 ha! Houghton apparently been at few games (don't know if true as not been since pre-season) - just seems what have now shambles.
@C_KAndrews well said - worst of referendum been disgraceful. Similar family story myself and no doubt losing child blow never recover from.
@PolOBrien not today but sure to be over the next few days.
@titch1982 a very odd situation - seems to make random changes that leaves players unsettled and short on confidence - not good for kids.
Seeing @acciesfc top of the league best way for @scottsas to sign off. Good luck for the future. http://t.co/xkvfYFuOfu
@titch1982 tweets crossed! Not long back & not seen what side the clown put out 2dy. We've got basis of good side but odd manager decisions.
@titch1982 met a lot today who were very much voting no - as I say, we'll both know for sure soon enough.
@AllyRoy67 @MonicaLennon7 @PolOBrien not today it wasn't - but will find out soon enough.
@titch1982 @MonicaLennon7 @PolOBrien absolutely - we'll know soon enough. In other news, Fulham still rubbish.
@PolOBrien  Rutherglen, Cambuslang, Halfway, Blantyre, Hamilton, Eddlewood & Eastfield - lots of folk fed up with Nationalist intimidation.
From @chrisdeerin on the shared nationalist playbook of SNP and UKIP https://t.co/V0irVaKZv0 #indyref
@scottsas - just seen that you are moving on. Good luck for the next chapter Scott & doubtless see you at a football ground somewhere soon.
@DJRobinski that is awful. I really worry about what the tenor of this is doing to communities in Scotland.
Just seen Sillars comments - wasn't it he who reminded us of Margo's distinction between opponents and enemies? Sad has degenerated to this
@cadogansexpert pooled support across UK - helps make renewables more affordable than if funded on Scottish consumer bills alone.

@leonc1963 getting rid of gvt in 8 months better than breaking away. £6bn immediate hole will hit poorest hardest not Salmond or Souter.
@leonc1963 and the Salmond prospectus ? Cut corporation tax 3p lower than UK - race to bottom. No wonder Murdoch & Souter cheerleaders.

@Kenny__Stewart have a good holiday - think early October destinations will be busy with journos recovering from ref
@Kenny__Stewart seems like a lot longer than six weeks ago. What you up to next ?
@AlistairMay "we haven't reported on it yet but we will after the result" funniest thing read on ref in a week of too much bile & hatred
@gordonhay56 wasn't a single q what Scot gvt consultation came back with as well? Wasn't UK gov decided that unilaterally.
@gordonhay56 didn't mean to imply you were - I want politics to work for social justice for all of UK & not in cul-de-sac of nationalism.
@gordonhay56 abolition is our policy, gvt defeat last wk from MPs all of UK on a Bill that makes that more likely. Sad most MPs SNP no show
Thanks to @GrahamJones_MP @NicDakinMP @bphillipsonMP & @LilianGreenwood out in #blantyre today - solidarity for all nations in UK #LabourNo

@lorddeben he was a great personal support on conscience issues though we didn't always end up agreeing. He will indeed be missed by many.
@riverflows77 without his guidance I would have struggled more with some testing votes in 1st half of this Plt. A very sad loss for so many.

Sad, sad news about Jim Dobbin. A decent man who was patient and responsive guide for some of us on difficult & complex moral issues. RIP
Oddly tweets never deleted keep showing up via @deletedbyMPs - strange.
@STindale @LeeW_Sport indeed. Moving to wrong bit of city bad for London clubs too - look at Charlton before got back to Valley, Wimbledon
The #coventry fans who went to Northampton on matchdays for a year but stayed outside on the hill deserved tonight.  http://t.co/1A5O0UoVmI
@STindale @LeeW_Sport yep part of city important too - Fulham in Fulham and not White City as we fought off a few yrs back.
@diogg @Coventry_City @acciesfc yes, great Cup final, plus way responded to losing at Sutton in 89 & like Fulham had Jimmy Hill as chairman
For some reason I can't really explain always liked @Coventry_City - pleased for fans they got back home & return with win v Gillingham

@DMKStand yes and list could be longer by this time tomorrow night...
Last RT: when you see a tweet from another MP and you want to caption pic or send sarcastic reply - but realise perhaps best not to.
@david_conn interesting aside there that he heard fans to go "back to the Cottage" - first time that's been acknowledged as reason.
@SteveArchibald8 @JonCoates giving it a good go. Your lay off 2 Sean Farrell v WBA at the Cottage still lodged in memory - almost 22yrs ago!
@JonCoates @SteveArchibald8 had a very brief but sublime cameo at Fulham mid-90s. 2 games & he was way too good for the rest of our side.
@scottex968 thanks Scott - out on the doorsteps every day. Nice to see you briefly earlier on.
@KennyFarq but Hoovers (sadly) went from Cambuslang some years ago.
@janekbradley nice piece and welcome antidote to those glorying in aggressive intolerance that seem to have taken over debate last 24hrs.

@jennykemp ok will ask around a few tomorrow to see if can help
@jennykemp is this for tonight or another day ?
@EdwardHarkins not disagreeing with that, rather yr specific point which not sure accurate. Will check with Trussell Trust and let you know.
@EdwardHarkins (3/3) something out of it. Certainly local foodbank value it as way of getting large number of ppl to donate when stocks low
@EdwardHarkins (2/3) on wider point doubt we disagree much - eg Morrisons sponsorship of Summerfest gives them pr value but Cambuslang gets
@EdwardHarkins I replied to tweet asking why supermarkets don't donate given profit from donations - &  explained think they do (1/2)
@EdwardHarkins that's diff. point to yr suggestion abt profiting from donations. Trussell Trust & Fare Share careful to prevent is my point.
@EdwardHarkins (2/2) complex to administer/verify. Seem to recall Trussell Trust etc saying see 33% as more than covering cumulative margin.
@EdwardHarkins presume as idea is ppl donate what want/can as they are shopping. If tried to do as you suggest at checkout then more (1/2)
@EdwardHarkins think they do mostly -why they add donation of one third of value of donations at end ?
@cadogansexpert agreed. It is precarious but at least some hope of progress on harder issues with proximity talks.
@cadogansexpert it really was properly cold. What's your take on news from Cairo ?

@titch1982 if carry on like this could ruin the best group of young players we have had for years - so change of approach or change of boss
@titch1982 yep but he sacked two managers last season and after Wolves and Derby selections, seems like Magath out of ideas already.
@titch1982 highlights is generous. Supposedly 1 game to save job - we play Brentford 2mrw. Now I hate Brentford, but *almost* want to lose.
@Gedk I am most grateful for the nomination but - here's the thing - can't I do the @euanmccolm iced bun challenge instead, bro ?

@dancrawford85 @dawnster21 doesn't strike me he has it in him to do so - would view it as sign of weakness. Man management not strong suit.
@dancrawford85 @dawnster21 my point is he seemed to signal buying experienced pros next wk - not sure any good enough would go near him/us.
Q is whether any experienced players of Champ standard would sign for Magath with his reputation? A load of Fotheringhams won't help.#ffc
“@JacquiOatley: Magath after 4th #FFC defeat - "good thing is...clear we have to change things”. S Khan thinking similar?” > bloody hope so

@annaturley actual fee lot less - he'd need to score hatful and us get promoted to get anywhere near £11m. Not likely on basis of first 4.
@fmeikle never thought  last beyond Christmas, maybe out sooner now? - watching today's Football Focus after game makes him seem clueless.
@annaturley hope so but no signs of it so far...perhaps by time we come to Boro in October.
@annaturley could be worse - you could be a Fulham fan.

@SimonBlah @jennifercwebber I see. Is that what is being suggested ?
@SimonBlah @jennifercwebber to end up where you were before being effectively forced out. Look at Charlton see impact of departure & return
@euanmccolm @happybirthtime thank you so much - I am following now. The Thierry Henry one almost made me choke on coffee.
@SimonBlah @jennifercwebber but it is where,or next to where, they were based and well established for yrs before 1st disastrous move away.
@SimonBlah @jennifercwebber thought they were trying to get to old dog track site, adjacent to Plough Lane ? Or am I out of date?
@djpboyle suggest you read report

Don't know all ins and outs of dispute but good news Coventry City going back to Coventry. Clubs shouldn't be forced away from communities.

@euanmccolm our two didn't notice or weren't fussed when we left - so much for emotional validation. http://t.co/VYir0STNra
Girls ready for school, but is school ready for them ? #prouddadday http://t.co/747mUfItk7
@PNWROOFING @emersonhyndman yep & @CauleyWoodrow too
@Iain_33 @emersonhyndman we have but think need to get balance with experience right over next few weeks
Wasn't a great first game in Championship from Fulham yesterday, but having watched again performance of @emersonhyndman a real positive
@HPaulODonnell @JeanFind no problem.
@AGilinsky plenty of years to get used to Fulham losing - not worth getting upset about. There'll be another game along next week.
@AGilinsky why am I upset ?
@HPaulODonnell @JeanFind welcome scrutiny of bad law, poorly drafted and implemented. As you know, Labour will repeal if win in 2016.
@leomiklasz @chrisdeerin @GerryBraiden the old favourite from FC Nurnberg http://t.co/NlmNOD0Mf7

@leomiklasz @chrisdeerin @GerryBraiden Oxford United proudest year http://t.co/9vhsqD2cxB
@GerryBraiden @chrisdeerin @leomiklasz oh for iconic sponsor - we had @GMBLondonRegion back in the day, pre-Fayed. Our worst: Pizza Hut
@sundersays @chrisdeerin but hypothetical debate - agree with Chris, they can't do it without throwing him overboard.
@sundersays @chrisdeerin precisely - as divisive as each other with voters. Just different sub-sets and judgement is impact on target grps
@sundersays @chrisdeerin most popular advocate amongst themselves since Tuesday at least - amongst real voters here as divisive as Salmond
@dkidd_SMirror ah, those innocent days before the internet and Asian betting syndicates made us all so suspicious of dubious talent.
@PNWROOFING @dkidd_SMirror funniest thing I ever saw at football was Jim falling down a hole in the pitch at Northampton #happydays
@dkidd_SMirror Laurence Batty and John Vaughan vying for emergency loan deal
“@dkidd_SMirror: Jim Stannard back in goals for Fulham tomorrow then?”> I'd pay to see that.
“@euanmccolm: in scotland, at least, we must be able to get "it's all gone pete wishart" into the lexicon.” > or into the box

The best day of football season is today - 46 chances to be delighted, downcast, disillusioned coming up - but today we can dream COYW #ffc
@schofieldkevin Forster to saints - and Fulham may get Boruc if he doesn't fancy bench-warming, I'm hearing.
Realise it wasn't best or most eventful match at Murrayfield tonight, but seems @BBCSportScot looking the other way http://t.co/BzSYFYJ4MI
From @ProfTomkins on dishonesty of Salmond/SNP on currency - last night showed Scots want answers, SNP just bluster http://t.co/UyCXtrqaGQ
@titch1982 other than at M'well, he's not featured pre-season. Rumours that Magath not impressed lack of fitness. May start on bench on Sat.
@titch1982 having seen 3 times now can agree with you about Hutchinson - looks like a good buy. Playing at Ipswich on Sat (on sky at 5.15)
@titch1982 If itv panel of undecideds anything to go by they weren't convinced by Salmond tonight.
@titch1982 not sure about that - we'll see soon enough (but not sure if vote will be broken down by constituency or just local authority)
@DavoMc82 @Jimmy_Stew did you watch the debate tonight ?
“@Jimmy_Stew: Salmond tried to insinuate that Alistair was less Scottish than him disgusting. #DarlingWin” > return of positive Nationalism
Not surprised 100% of ITV undecided panel called it for Alistair - too many gaping holes in SNP prospectus & no answers 2nite #scotdecides
@SimonGHayter you're
So #ScotDecides repeated on BBC Parly 2morrow - cue protest outside Pacific Quay from Nationalists after Salmond's flailing performance
Salmond's inability to answer q on currency shows why SNP led campaign flailing and failing to convince. 2 late 4 relaunch now #scotdecides

@alstewitn worth reading Moira Kelly from Chartered Institute of Taxation on practicalities of 2012 Act (but you may conclude life 2 short)
@alstewitn and that of many of my constituents too. Somehow straightforward always becomes hideously complex through gvt IT prism.
@alstewitn dealing with dozens of constituent HMRC cases, given it is HMRC systems being revised, would suggest that is wise precaution!
@alstewitn 1998 Act power vary +/- 3p. 2012 Act transfers duty to set income tax rate. Comes into effect 2016 (lead in to make IT etc work)
@alstewitn powers in Scotland Act 2012 (which come into effect 2016) different as require Holyrood to set income tax rate in Scot ->,<, or =
@alstewitn & year on year growth in Holyrood budget from inception & surplus left when Lab left office in Edinburgh a factor
@alstewitn you are. Legislated for in Scotland Act post referendum. Powers never used & irony is SNP let lapse (without telling Holyrood)

@GABaines on networks - where regulator can. On retail, Cameron's Tories voted against regulator passing on price reductions last month.

@wendycockcroft what it says - renewable heat will take time - meantime need gas. Which is not same as saying not worth it. As you knew.
@wendycockcroft and that doesn't say what you claimed, does it ?
@glynmoody @wendycockcroft exactly - and how much being burnt by Germany and what is it doing to their emissions ?
@wendycockcroft where ? Don't put words into my mouth based on your prejudices.
“@Eleric33: @tomgreatrexmp , dont get excited mate its a third rate competition, in fact an international joke.” > sad & inappropriate
@wendycockcroft and who is failing to consider it ?
@wendycockcroft @glynmoody have a look at what Germany doing on unconventional gas and how much lignite they are burning
@wendycockcroft geothermal, ground source & air source pumps important - but will take long time to reduce 80% use gas for heat.
@dukesy12 tell you what - check what have said about this then come back.
@Aunty_Fracker perhaps you should check what have said & then come back old girl
@dukesy12 licence is for all onshore exploration - regulation needs to be robust for any shale extraction. Govt rhetoric irresponsible
Just seen Libby Clegg storm T12 100m final to win first track & field Commonwealth Gold for  @Team_Scotland in 20yrs http://t.co/ZQPaIYARUQ
@Aunty_Fracker licensing is not permission to undertake any activity though is it.
@DenzpDp would suggest US experience shows precisely why robust regulation is anything but meaningless.

@Ian_Albert thanks.
Roads revolution? One definition of revolution is to go round, to rotate, to spin. To that extent Cameron's roads plans are v revolutionary
So the roads revolution is in fact a roads re-announcement...
Memo to media: Cameron's so-called 'roads revolution' involves schemes & money already announced in summer 2013. Not much of a revolution...
@Outoftweet123 @QuentinWillson @FairFuelUK Silent on roads & fuel prices? What apart from our HMT team on Thurs + Mary's speech at lab conf?

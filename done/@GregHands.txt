"Last night's result suggests it will be hard for Reckless to retain the seat" says Indy's @JohnRentoul #Rochester http://t.co/l1V3YXaW4r
First speech by @MarkReckless for UKIP in Commons right now, urging support for a Labour bill. Immediate proof that vote UKIP, get Miliband.
When I saw the photo of Emily Thornberry's house in Islington, I imagined she must have resigned over Ed's Mansion Tax, not over a tweet.
Worth noting that the UKIP majority was only half of that implied in the polls last week - the same polls which gave us a small maj in May.
Disappointed by the Rochester result, but a good fight from our @KellyTolhurst and with only a 2,920 majority, I am confident for May 2015!
Worth recalling that Emily Thornberry was one of the few Labour MPs who voted for Ed Miliband as Leader in 2010 http://t.co/bhWNRHfmet
Conservative MPs who have heard @DouglasCarswell's anti-NHS views for years are now hearing from UKIP he loves the NHS. #PhoneyCarswell

I think Labour is basically saying they would pay Brussels their £1.7bn. There go the proceeds of their £2bn "Mansion Tax" - yet again.

Question for @DouglasCarswell - why *are* you taking photographs of visiting Conservative MPs in Clacton?
@hackney_hal @GABaines But IDS doesn't pretend to live in Chingford, and nor does he campaign against the so-called "SW1 elites"

@AngusFanshawe @DouglasCarswell May be, but how many of them say they are "taking on the SW1 elite?"  That's the point.
Odd how none of the UKIP leaflets in Clacton from @douglascarswell attacking the "SW1 elite" mention that he lives in SW6.

We already have a "Mansion Tax" in the UK. Stamp Duty of 7%. And crucially, it's on purchase, not an annual levy, so it's on ability to pay.
Labour's Karen Buck says "purchaser of £140 million home" pays same as £3m home. No. Stamp Duty on former = huge £9.8m. Latter = big £0.21m.

@hackney_hal @HeathrowAirport but it isn't. Everyone knows what the product is, and there is one monopoly provider of it here at Heathrow.
@Morris__Bright blimey, 15 mins. That's tight!
.@HeathrowAirport in summary, your WiFi policy: "if we get you, our customer, away on time, it's free. If we delay you, you pay".
I agree with @TimMontgomerie and @Conor_BurnsMP. The media must stop using the self-styled term "The Islamic State". All 3 words wrong.
.@HeathrowAirport With respect, I don't think anybody is going to come to Heathrow solely to use the free WiFi.
.@HeathrowAirport but my point is, why *only* 45 mins free WiFi? My plane has been delayed here & now I have been doubly penalised by you!
Why not @HeathrowAirport offer free WiFi to your customers beyond 45 mins? Or is there a worry they'd come here just to spend hours surfing?
.@HeathrowAirport kindly offers free WiFi , but only for 45 minutes, meaning you get hammered twice over when your flight is delayed.

Correction! RT@Le_Figaro @GregHands Not exactly. What we mean: with French deaths alone at 27.000, most deadly day in french army's history.
Le Figaro reports that this day in 1914, with French deaths alone at 27,000, was the most deadly day of conflict in the 20th century.

2/2 Without showing any plans for the location of the "Chelsea West" site, there is now a lot of speculation about possible demolitions.
TfL confirmed at Chelsea Town hall yesterday they needed up to 5,000 sq metres for the construction site for the station. 1/2
Without any location plans for the "Chelsea West" option for the Crossrail 2 station, I find TfL's consultation fundamentally flawed.
@juliogrigio I am - but we need to see some detail on where it could be!
A lot of irritation at the TfL Crossrail meeting that there are no clear location plans for the proposed "Chelsea West" station.
@jimwaterson In favour of Crossrail 2? As the MP for Chelsea, yes.

@Anirudh1969 @Conservatives Exactly. And they would have rather a big say in England if weak Ed Miliband were to be Prime Minister. Sun Apr 19 09:23:10 BST 2015
I put my ex-constituent @TedTalksUK's amazing success on University Challenge to his one week internship with me in 2008! #CheekyCreditClaim Sat Apr 18 20:43:32 BST 2015
The consequence of a Miliband govenrment, with the SNP, would be more taxes, more borrowing and more debt. http://t.co/FFkTK4lDt4 Sat Apr 18 18:41:58 BST 2015
As Peter Mandelson said, Labour sent out 'search parties for people' and under them net migration increased more than five-fold. Sat Apr 18 13:32:35 BST 2015
Miliband speaking about immigration, but under Labour 2.5 million more people came in than went out - double the population of Birmingham. Sat Apr 18 13:28:39 BST 2015

Now Labour in Wales wants to 'get rid' of Trident, as the Party starts to snuggle ever closer to the SNP & Plaid http://t.co/AkmLy6zfaY Fri Apr 17 18:17:07 BST 2015
Startling from last night's #challengersDebate that Miliband still very much ruling in some kind of deal with Sturgeon, Salmond and the SNP. Fri Apr 17 12:41:55 BST 2015
Today, IMF's Lagarde and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble praise UK economy and the Conservatives' "very good plan for the future" Fri Apr 17 10:31:10 BST 2015
Unemployment is falling thanks to the action we have taken since 2010 - cuts in the Jobs Tax, cuts in corporation tax, cuts in income tax. Fri Apr 17 10:19:07 BST 2015

That was a 90 minute trailer for a 5 year programme of chaos under Ed Miliband & his Frankenstein coalition. Don't let it happen #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:36:45 BST 2015
Ed Miliband needs to explain urgently his comment that he "respects" the SNP desire to break up our country. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:28:50 BST 2015
Nicola Sturgeon taking over the debate completely. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:20:44 BST 2015
Miliband says he doesn't want *coalition* with the SNP, but doesn't rule out a deal. Far from it. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:18:02 BST 2015
SNP, Plaid and Greens all saying they won't do a deal with us. but each says they would do with Miliband. Coalition of chaos. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:17:01 BST 2015
An hour of this so far. Imagine 5 years of this. Left and Lefter squabbling with each other. The Coalition of chaos. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:15:05 BST 2015
Chaos on the stage as the Frankenstein coalition starts to row and fall apart. Imagine 5 years of this? #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:10:27 BST 2015
Miliband isn't going after Sturgeon. That's because he wants and needs to do a deal with her. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:05:52 BST 2015
Sturgeon is taking over this debate, pushing Ed Miliband around. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:03:28 BST 2015
Sturgeon talking about "the country" with reference to immigration. Once again, which country is she talking about? #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:02:57 BST 2015
Sturgeon making traditional CND arguments on Trident. Clear that she would force Miliband to give up our strong defences. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:52:09 BST 2015
Miliband & Sturgeon. How can he even consider forming a government with a Party that doesn't even want to be in the same country? #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:49:57 BST 2015
Sturgeon says "the country needs to be defended appropriately". But which country does she mean....#bbcdebate Thu Apr 16 20:45:27 BST 2015
@wdjstraw he wasn't invited. This is the challengers debate. Thu Apr 16 20:40:28 BST 2015
Miliband talks about the politics of "letting down our families". From the expert on letting down his family. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:39:11 BST 2015
Sturgeon and Farage going head to head on immigration - but where's Miliband?? #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:37:07 BST 2015
Miliband is now silent. Where is he? Voices further to the Left are dominating. This would be a coalition of chaos! #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:36:18 BST 2015
Sturgeon getting a cheer as she keeps dragging the debate (and Ed Miliband) further to the left  #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:31:29 BST 2015
What we're seeing here is a giant Coalition negotiation between SNP, Labour, Greens & Plaid. And it's already heading leftwards. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:26:18 BST 2015
The others already picking apart Miliband''s very limited budget savings. Clear he would be pushed by them into more spending. #bbcdebate Thu Apr 16 20:24:52 BST 2015
Sturgeon already pushing Miliband to "be bolder". She's trying to push him to the left again. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:23:41 BST 2015
Miliband very weak. Already being pushed around left, right and centre by the other challengers. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:21:54 BST 2015
Plaid Cymru asks if Miliband will reverse the £30Bn of cuts he's signed up to. They & Sturgeon are already in negotiation #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:20:53 BST 2015
Sturgeon nails Miliband on his refusal to match us in the extra £8bn for the NHS. #BBCdebate Thu Apr 16 20:17:50 BST 2015
Miliband unable to list much in the way of cuts he would make. Allied with the SNP, I doubt he'd even be able to make those. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:16:57 BST 2015
Most of the challengers pay lip service to reducing the debt, but then talk about increasing spending. Chaos. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:12:41 BST 2015
Miliband says he rejects Cameron's spending cuts. Looks sideways to Sturgeon for approval. #JustNotUpToIt BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:11:02 BST 2015
Good question on the debt. Sturgeon clearly doesn't agree. Immediately attacks "austerity". She would force Miliband to the left. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:09:29 BST 2015
Worth stating yet again that as he isn't a challenger, David Cameron was not invited to tonight's debate. #ChallengersDebate #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:06:23 BST 2015
Miliband already lurching to the Left in his opening statement, to pander to the SNP #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:05:34 BST 2015
Leanne Wood: "cuts are not a choice". But Milband has signed up to £30bn of cuts through the Charter of Budget Responsibility. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:04:37 BST 2015
Looking forward to the #BBCDebate. Will SNPs Sturgeon again offer to make Miliband Prime Minister? And will he say he's accepting? Thu Apr 16 20:03:21 BST 2015

Ed should be asked here why he has opposed every single budget saving we have proposed the last 5 years, yet claims to be responsible? Mon Apr 13 11:51:04 BST 2015
Ed refuses again to admit he spent too much money last time. In one answer, he blows any claim to economic responsibility. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:42:14 BST 2015
ITV asking Ed "when will you balance the budget?" Ed can't answer that, what is a pretty basic question. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:36:32 BST 2015
@christopherhope @jameskirkup more badgers were killed under Labour than under the Conservatives, Labour themselves admit. Mon Apr 13 11:34:08 BST 2015
Ed says he's "been tested". This is true, he was Gordon's right hand man, 1997 - 2010. The result was economic breakdown. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:31:18 BST 2015
Labour telling Scotland they will spend much more. Labour telling England they will make cuts. The SNP promise "to keep them honest". Mon Apr 13 11:29:08 BST 2015

Under Labour, the last government was borrowing £1 for every £4 it was spending. We have now got the finances under control. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 10:56:55 BST 2015
Balls & Miliband deny they overspent the last time. But they want you to trust them again with the nation's money. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 10:50:07 BST 2015

Ruth: "Why is Nicola (Sturgeon) running around, saying Labour are rubbish, but I want to put them in office?" #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:14:11 BST 2015
Punchy opening from @RuthDavidsonMSP showing she is a match for anyone. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:12:43 BST 2015

Only a week into the campaign, and Balls already talking Jobs Tax rises, Council Tax rises & dragging more people into 40p income tax rate. Mon Apr 06 14:54:46 BST 2015

In 2010, you could only earn £6,475 tax-free. From today, it's £10,600. That's a tax cut for 26m people & 3m out of Income Tax altogether! Mon Apr 06 13:05:39 BST 2015

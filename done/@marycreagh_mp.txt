Ed Miliband _Cameron has put party interest ahead of the national interest.
EM "Cameron started out with the EU divided over Juncker. Ended with them united against him. Quite an achievement.
Problem with Cameron is that he plays to his Eurosceptic  backbenchers not UK interests. Cliché laden twaddle.
Cameron mentions Clegg and turns to acknowledge him. He is not there.
Cameron says important for EU Council to decide next Commission president. They did. Cameron was too weak to make alliances. UK weakened.
Cameron stands for EU council summit statement. Every Tory backbencher stands up behind him. Nervous smiles from speaker's assistants.

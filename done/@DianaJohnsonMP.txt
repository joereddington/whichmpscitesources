Passionate defence of NHS @CliveEfford opening debate on his Private Members Bill in Commons this morning.
In the Commons to back the @CliveEfford's Bill to save our NHS. Hull MPs #backthebill! http://t.co/b4lUcGw9Mp
@barhamsaint How about joining me in fighting for a fair deal for Hull?
 Fact - central government slashed money to Hull by 25%.

Very pleased to be at reception for Clive Efford's Bill in Commons tomorrow to stop the privatisation of NHS services #backthebill
In Business Questions just asked about lack of urgency in Whitehall over arts funding, big events and rail electrification for @2017Hull.
http://t.co/8W2ZauG1zC
Asked BIS Ministers about 84% fall in equal pay claims since introduction of tribunal fees - at a time when gender pay gap is increasing.
In BIS Questions, just asked how Coalition can have credibility on Living Wage when they're failing to enforce the National Minimum Wage.
@08DanJMartin I support the EWA. I want to make sure we  do not become a safe haven for criminals & we get back criminals who flee from  UK.
"Home Secretary ducking and diving on these measures" says @YvetteCooperMP. House of Lords allowed to debate all 35 measures but Commons not
Opposition have to put down the motion to ensure that Commons has a vote on European Arrest Warrant . What is going on with the Government?
Excellent opening by @YvetteCooperMP on making sure the Commons have a vote on the European Arrest warrant as promised by the PM.
@joshsmithy22 hi just been told they are outside your front door!
@joshsmithy22 hi will chase! Hope u r well?
For those who didn't hear the debate I had on @BBCRadio4 about #TTIP and the #NHS on Sunday, it's at  https://t.co/03c2WttuDE via @audioBoom
Pleased to hear on @RadioHumberside that, despite unfair Government cuts, Hull councillors have listened to my representations on Ennerdale.
I hear that Scunthorpe has become the latest A&E in the Y&H region to ask patients to stay away if possible. Winter's not even started yet.
@philipjcowley @paulwaugh Perhaps the Government were serving up half measures with too much froth.
Hull MP challenges Nick Clegg on failing to back early Hull rail electrification - see http://t.co/SjIzjAiYRR. http://t.co/C3yzFubHwP
In waffling about "affordability" in his answer, the DPM ignored the fact that Hull's rail electrification scheme is privately financed!
Just asked DPM why he's not backing Hull's bid to get Hull rail electrification done in time for @2017Hull - instead waiting until 2020s.
Fascinating visit to the new First World War exhibition at the @I_W_M. @IWM_Centenary #WW1 http://t.co/fyymf59p2C
Well done to @thedeephull. Excellent news for @2017Hull
@David_Cameron seemed to have more to say on security issues to the Australian Parliament than to his own!
Just asked @David_Cameron if he will bring back relocation powers, that Coalition scrapped, to deal with terror suspects. Weak answer.
Pleased to hear General Synod has taken the final step to end the stained glass ceiling on women bishops. Be great if Hull was one of first.
Home Office ministers refuse to answer @BillEstersonMP's question about child abusers in the vicinity of a residential children’s home.
@SkyNewsBreak Wonder if he'll try to blame the previous Labour Government this time around!
@DavAndFra Good to speak briefly this afternoon and please e mail me on johnsond@parliament.uk.
Congratulations @cinbbc on raising £32.6m. That's nearly a third of the £100m cut in annual budget Hull City Council has had since 2010.
Big #labourdoorstep session in King's Park. Big thanks to all colleagues helping. http://t.co/c9aJCIIr0Y

Hull A&E gets ‘sticking plaster’ funding - see http://t.co/sY4mMzjrNt. #FairDealforHull
How much of this £300m Winter A&E funding nationally is going to Hull NHS? Last Winter we didn't get a penny from £250m. #FairDealforHull
@Kitty_B_Good @iredalepolitics can we be sure they haven't selected Neil Hamilton to fight Boston and Skegness for UKIP?
Oh dear don't think Greg Dyke handled questions about Ched Evans very well at all on @BBCNewsnight
Very bizarre that UKIP won't say who they selected tonight to fight general election in Boston and Skegness @looknorthBBC @iredalepolitics
@cycling_walker with you a all the way on that!
While Hull waits for rail electrification and Transpennine rail routes are threatened with cuts in favour of South... http://t.co/St7xmf5GdU
Discussing some worrying new figures about the NHS in Hull on @RadioHumberside, around 7.15 in the morning.
Enjoyed @MadeinDagenham today. Pleased many of the original women are still around to get much-deserved recognition. http://t.co/qm3gGnbjr8
#Lifestyle2014 wonderful news  Born This Way are the winners! Enjoy Florida!
Very best of luck this evening to Becky and Born This Way #lifestylefinalist
Looking forward to seeing @MadeinDagenham this afternoon. With the gender pay gap widening the fight for Equal Pay goes on. #equalpayday
With economy growing early in 2010, today's improving jobs & pay news should have come 3 years ago - instead of 3 lost years of flatlining.
@looknorthBBC @RadioHumberside Hull already has lowest number of full-time frontline police since 1979 - with more Coalition cuts to come.
@bbcburnsy Does the PCC believe he has enough resources to deal with the growing problem of child sexual exploitation & online child abuse?
Dapper Laughs on @BBCNewsnight  Really? Is this man really worth the air time?
After returning only four weeks ago, the @HouseofCommons has just gone into yet another mini-Recess for no legitimate reason at all.
Will be speaking to @IainDale on @LBC Radio about the Wanless Report, around 5.10pm.
About to speak to @BBCNews Channel about the Wanless Report.
Government #omnishambles continues in Commons. Row being going on since 4 30. #voteonEAW
@kdnicho Hello I am on the front bench in Parliament this evening . Will Tuesday be ok? Or please e mail me on johnsond@parliament.uk
Still confusion over what the Home Secretary is asking the House of Commons to vote on in her European Arrest Warrant #omnishambles. #MayDay
Tories now laying into the Government for failure to allow a debate on European Arrest Warrant. Complete shambles by the Government.
Whose idea was it to keep the European Arrest warrant out of the debate today? Home Secretary & Chief Whip busy conferring on front bench.
The Government's omnishambles is in full swing in the House of Commons at the moment over the European Arrest Warrant.
Exactly what is the salary of the Chief Exec of new public body Flood Re? Reports of £250,000? Why? How is this justified? #floodinsurance
Attending Hull's Civic Remembrance Service. We owe them so much. http://t.co/liiWMZ7ofW
Great fundraising event for Hull North CLP this afternoon. Thanks to the excellent @FudgeFood and Alan Johnson MP. http://t.co/cWhRK4HeGl

Appalled to hear about Judge ordering Hull soldier back from Afghanistan to remove his medals, while defendants could keep their poppies on.
On my way to BBC Hull to discuss 2017 City of Culture with the BBC Director General.
Clegg: No Hull rail electrification until after City of Culture. See http://t.co/zAcQL8au4o. http://t.co/32oHUmjzGm
Just spoke to @itvcalendar about Nick Clegg's announcement that Hull rail electrification won't happen before 2017. http://t.co/vR86rxBnv0
@iankatz1000 Do you think she's put her foot in it?
@DarrenTullock @HumbersidePCC hello can you call my office on 01482 319135 or e mail me on johnsond@parliament.uk. Thank you
So Clegg making big promises about rail  today yet the carriage I am in to Hull has no heating and blankets been distributed! # victorian
Discussing worrying new figures on child abuse that @LBC has uncovered on the station shortly.
@iredalepolitics thanks for explanation but strange as normally BBC approach MPs directly for example Yorkshire politics show on Sunday?
Just watched @iredalepolitics #yorkswhatnext needed to hear more from young people & why only a Tory MP & UKIP MEP? No Labour MP? Why?
Coalition rejects Labour plan to devolve bus service powers. See http://t.co/1PzMQWaZbk. http://t.co/HPN3hBU6Ge
@RadioHumberside When even our national City of Culture doesn't get a fair deal on arts funding something is seriously wrong.
My New Statesman blog about Norman Baker's resignation is at http://t.co/KpNfKdb2Iz.
Also Lib Dems & Tories voted against a specific exploitation offence to tackle vulnerable adults being exploited #ModernSlaveryBill #shame
Lib Dem and Tory MPs today voted down Labour's amendment on making child exploitation a specific criminal offence. #ModernSlaveryBill #Shame
Now speaking for Labour on the Modern Slavery Bill, trying to strengthen the Bill further. http://t.co/XwcwrHgcBc
On Labour Front Bench for Report Stage and Third Reading of the Modern Slavery Bill. #modernslavery
Curious how Lib Dems were happy "walking through mud" to cut tax for millionaires, introduce the Bedroom Tax and triple tuition fees.
So will be on fourth Lib Dem Minister in Home Office  since 2010 now Norman Baker resigns. They don't stick around for very long do they ?
Hull MP slams growing gender pay gap under Coalition - see http://t.co/umJZRyZNY5. Equal Pay Day tomorrow!
In DWP Questions, just raised the 53% & rising level of child poverty in Orchard Park & Greenwood. Complacent answer from Lib Dem Minister.
@SeemaMalhotra1 and I have written a blog on the link between human trafficking and the sex industry - see http://t.co/B7CWJB3gKS.
The wonderful Liz Charles on @bbcburnsy now. A real champion for the local NHS.
Good question why A&E in early Nov with new facilities & mild weather having so many problems?Really concerned when winter comes @bbcburnsy
@Tinglepolitics Well, they would say that, wouldn't they? @iredalepolitics
Need for action on supply chains to ensure businesses don't use slave labour will be debated on Tuesday in Parliament @YvetteCooperMP
About to discuss the Home Secretary's mishandling of the child abuse inquiry on @LBC.
@lin64 @looknorthBBC Good question! What worries me is that we aren't even in the depths of winter when A&Es usually under pressure yet.
@EmmaLewellBuck so glad you were speaking for politicians listening and working hard for their constituents at Westminster on @BBCNews
@cjfaraway thank you for twitter link I didn't have it!  Ian made the strongest case why consultation is absolutely the right thing to do.
@cjfaraway @SimonDanczuk @IanMcFadyen1966 Agree compelling arguments made by Ian for survivors to be fully engaged in chair appointment.
Good point about using a more consultative approach to selecting a chair and panel members by @SimonDanczuk on@Channel4News
Tory MP on @Channel4News not helping as clear lack of due diligence in appointing Fiona Woolf and survivors no input into who chair was.
Will @David_Cameron now also express his 'complete confidence' in his Home Secretary, as he did earlier in Fiona Woolf?
@emmaannhardy great news! I could only see men !!
@emmaannhardy please tell me that the event doesn't have an all male panel?
Real questions about Home Secretary Theresa May's competence in now losing a second chair of the CSA inquiry.
So meeting with survivors of childhood abuse was with 2 panel members & counsel to inquiry. Why not a meeting with Chair and Home Secretary?
@AlanBillingsPCC Excellent news that you have been elected as the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner. Congratulations.
@conradlandin @GrannyPat60 of course we all decide for ourselves what we choose to wear.
This week's Whitehall rhetoric about having no power cuts this Winter appears not to have lasted long in Hull tonight.
@andrewpercy perhaps you should have the ministers job!
@andrewpercy Andrew it's the job of the opposition and a constituency MP to ask questions about problems such as slow payments by government
@andrewpercy By July, Government had paid out just £403,000 from the original £10m pledged by the PM in extra flood assistance.
@andrewpercy Coalition cut flood defence funding from £670m in 2010/11 to £576m in both 2013/14 and 2014/15. A £97m cut - 17% in real terms.
@andrewpercy Under Coalition’s current plans the number of properties at significant risk of flooding is likely to rise by 80,000 by 2020.
@andrewpercy @LabourDefra Since Eton was flooded in February to be exact, meanwhile flood defence spending cut and insurance premiums soar.
Speaking for Opposition Front Bench in House of Commons debate on drugs policy.
Just replied for the Opposition on search and rescue policy for boats carrying migrants and refugees, governed by international maritime law
In Church Commissioner Questions, I just asked why women bishops measure gives the Established Church exemption from gender equality laws.
@CllrAlanClark That was the same Lib Dem Council who spent money on an earlier City of Culture bid - and didn't make the shortlist.
@CllrAlanClark I remember having to campaign early in 2010 to stop the former Lib Dem Council spending £250,000 on giant plastic toads.
In DEFRA Questions, I just raised the issue of assistance to those communities hit by flooding last Winter - including in Hull.
Good points by @HazelBlearsMP on @BBCNewsnight. Need 4 a strong deterrent to stop people travelling 2 fight 4 ISIS & prosecute those who do.
@IrrancaDaviesMP @looknorthBBC @RBanima join the club I have the most horrendous cold! Thank goodness for Lemsip!
Good news on @looknorthBBC 100 science jobs come to Hull with major investment  @RBanima. Hull capital of production 4 Lemsip and Neurofen!
Great report on @BBCNews about @Nowzad dog charity in Afghanistan. Really moving story about Peg and her brave & wonderful family in the UK
More evidence of Coalition failure on equal pay and gender equality. http://t.co/0ntNA6Drhc
@alstewitn no please not the dog!
@Sharonavraham such a depressing programme - people struggling looking for work with a benefits system not fit for purpose @C4Dispatches
Shocking report on women trafficked for sex from Romania from age 11 & called "luggage " by those trafficking @Channel4News  #modernslavery
On these long term HS3 plans, Hull is excluded from Nick Clegg's 'Golden Triangle' - and face Transpennine rail service cuts in short term.
“@DailyMirror: Leeds to Manchester in 26 minutes with new HS3 train service http://t.co/Jtmqh1tIBR” Hull doesn't even have 'High Speed One'!

@RobFlelloMP and Diesel well done on winning Westminster Dog of the year!
@Finlome @OpinionYP @yorkshirepost Exactly that's why we have to talk about grooming, unhealthy & abusive relationships & how to stay safe.
As ever, @David_Cameron seems to think that Prime Minister's Questions are questions from the Prime Minister. #PMQs
On my way to speak to @bbcburnsy on @RadioHumberside about sex and relationships education and child protection. #SRE
My Commons speech today on my Sex and Relationships Education (Curriculum) Bill can be read at http://t.co/DFf2msY7qd.
Over next hour, speaking to @andycomfort on @RadioHumberside, @peter_levy on @looknorthBBC and @IainDale on @LBC about #SRE.
Why does the prospect of children being taught how to protect themselves from paedophiles offend Tory MP Philip Davies so much? #SRE
Should be delivering my Sex and Relationships Education (Curriculum) Bill in the Commons shortly after 12.30. #SRE
About to discuss National Crime Agency's non-pursuit of thousands of those accessing online child abuse images with @BBCNewsChannel.
Just spoke in House welcoming women bishops and hoping that one of the first might be the replacement for the excellent @rmcfrith in Hull.
@RadioHumberside @andycomfort Will have to be tomorrow! In the Chamber of the Commons at the moment to speak in favour on women bishops.
Hoping to speak in the Commons later on the Church of England Measure to approve women bishops - at long last! http://t.co/E8hEqIqyA6
@LabourEoin hi thanks for DM can u also send DM to @DavidHansonMP as he is leading on this? Thanks
Excellent #labourdoorstep in Hull North today thanks to everyone who helped especially @HullUniLabour
After my Hull advice surgery, delighted to host 'welcome drinks' for members of @HullUniLabour. http://t.co/8oEYJLiRve
Strong defence of why the European Arrest Warrant is vital to fighting crime in UK & in our national interest @DavidHansonMP on @BBCRadio4
@jgb00m no it was a letter to all my constituents about the local NHS and as you are one of them you received it too.
@jgb00m ok will not contact you again but it's the electoral register your name is on not any list I keep.
@jgb00m Hello the letter is to all my constituents in Hull North about their experience of the NHS. Hope you will reply?
@bbcnews_ticker But still not ports such as Hull and Dover? #Ebola
Asked Foreign Secretary what action is being taken to help prevent young women in UK being radicalised and going abroad to be 'ISIL brides'.
Just spoke to @itvcalendar about #Ebola screening for ports such as Hull. http://t.co/ZOVYh6l4Tg
In Business Qs, I asked what action is planned for ports like Hull after announcement on #Ebola screening at Heathrow, Gatwick and Eurostar.
Asked Women's Minister whether or not she supports or opposes having proper sex and relationships education in all schools. #SRE
In DCMS Qs, I just asked how Hull will deliver national 2017 City of Culture with 25% cut to LA and arts funding so biased towards London.
No, not further evidence of Parliament's 'super rodent' problem! Just showed my backing for the #VoteForBob campaign. http://t.co/m2g1jqIDXB
@LouiseWriter @2017Hull very pleased to do so!
Why did Lib Dem MP Andrew Stunnell say he supported specific offences for child trafficking & then vote against in the Modern Slavery Bill?
Tour de force from @DavidHansonMP on need 4 a review of Gangmasters Licensing Authority to extend its role into construction, cleaning etc
So cross party pre legislative committee on Modern Slavery Bill support child trafficking & exploitation offences. Lib Dems & Tories ignore
Lawyers & charities demand specific offences to combat the evil of child trafficking &exploitation. Lib Dem MPs vote with Tories to stop.
Lib Dem MPs on Modern Slavery Bill committee Sarah Teather and Sir Andrew Stunell vote against an independent anti slavery commissioner.
In Modern Slavery Bill committee  am shocked that Lib Dem MPs voted against specific offences for child trafficking and child exploitation.
Back in Committee for the Modern Slavery Bill.
In House backing @KeeleyMP's excellent Ten Minute Rule Bill to exempt carers from the Lib Dem-backed Bedroom Tax.
Why only 108 cases referred to Disclosure and Barring Service by the Police when huge concern people accessing on line child abuse images?
Great question from @SeemaMalhotra1 on governments failure to secure  more prosecutions in rape cases.
Shocking complacency from Home Secretary on 20k people who access on line child abuse images & not followed up even when work with children
Just asked Home Secretary why with 20,000 people accessing online child abuse Police referred only 108 cases to the Barring Service last yr.
What's clear after Nick Clegg's speech is that Lib Dems in government hold the country back far more than they hold the Tories back.
Despite recent spin, Lib Dem Conference today voted against axing the Bedroom Tax. It's official - only a Labour Government will axe it.
“@timeshighered: Vince Cable warns that Tories could raise tuition fees "significantly"” From two-faced Lib Dems who voted to triple them!
“@LibbyWienerITV: Libdem President Tim Farron not ruling out another coalition with Tories'” It's official: They'd do it again. #condems
Noting that yet another large transport scheme is being pushed for London, while await Hull rail electrification! http://t.co/f2z2VvpGcD
@ChrisMasonBBC @bbc5live He thinks the pay bill for providing the service is separate from the service?
@itvnews And being in Coalition with those very same Conservatives 'speaks volumes' about the Lib Dems too.
Although it's not over until he's in Hull, I'm pleased to hear that my constituent @kdnicho is now due to be home, at long last, tomorrow.
@englishoak @YvetteCooperMP no GLA limited role which needs to be reviewed to cover sectors like care and construction.
@englishoak @YvetteCooperMP real problem with way offences are defined. Need a very clear exploitation offence irrespective of consent.
@delirioushappy Not all of them and that needs to be changed
Child Protection will be a priority for a Labour government in 2015 & convicted sex offenders will be barred from working with children
Great speech @YvetteCooperMP Labour will introduce exploitation offences for workers kept in forced labour in this country.
Powerful speech by @YvetteCooperMP to #lab14 http://t.co/kAUwOPVpwr

Fabulous turnout in #indyref . Hard fought campaign and absolutely the right result. Real need for re-engagement with voters in rest of Uk.
@RadioHumberside Nick Clegg's Government is imposing heaviest cuts on Hull and North, and failing on devolving Whitehall funding to regions.

On way home 2 Hull after busy week leading for Labour on #modernslaverybill. Looking forward to meeting with Labour women in Hull tomorrow.
Well done to Yorkshire's cricket county champions.
Need to press Government 2 include supply chains in the #ModernSlaveryBill. Government fail to include despite businesses support 4 new law.
Government refuses to listen to concerns on trafficked children exploited and forced to commit crimes then prosecuted #modernslaverybill
Just finished another Modern Slavery Bill Committee session.
Just raised in Commons why Hull loses £628 per household in LA funding under Coalition, while Surrey's Elmbridge gains £41. #FairDealforHull
In BIS Questions, just asked Ministers where the UK Green Investment Bank would be located, should Scotland vote to leave the UK. #LabourNo
In BIS Questions I just raised the lack of enforcement of the National Minimum Wage since 2010.
If Lib Dems now want to scrap Police and Crime Commissioners, why did they vote to waste up to £100m setting them up in the first place?

@gzunder @IsabelHardman this week at Westminster women speaking out on counter terrorism, Rotherham child abuse, Modern Slavery Bill etc
@gzunder @IsabelHardman You cannot be serious !
@uncleganja @LabourEoin @BBCRadio4 and has that ever happened ? Whereas all male panels and programmes seen as completely acceptable.
@IsabelHardman @BBCRadio4 Good ! Perhaps next week we can have a female presenter and all women MPs. Lots of talented women you can use.
@IsabelHardman I just wonder if any women were actually asked? Real problem with media using same MPs over and over again. Good to diversify
@IsabelHardman @BBCRadio4 yes but today whole programme was male! All the MPs were male.
Why is there not one women's voice on @BBCRadio4 Week in Westminster? Presenter and all contributors male. Explanation please?
Great @RadioHumberside discussing problem of slavery in UK & around the world with brilliant Wilberforce Institute Hull #freedomfestival
At Constituency advice surgery after rushing up from the Commons.
@dannyalexander Or Bedroom Tax, as non-Tories call it. Without Lib Dem votes the Bedroom Tax wouldn't be law in the first place.
Most important factor is for #CSAinquiry to have confidence of victims of abuse. Panel needs to involve victims & give the support they need
Still no terms of reference for #CSAinquiry. Needs to look into current gaps in child protection as well as historical failures.
Delighted to have voted to start dismantling the hated #bedroomtax which is causing so much misery to people in Hull 306 votes yes 231 no
Pleased that Labour won Bedroom Tax reform votes in House today. Let's see how Lib Dems vote when Labour now tries for total abolition.
“@Rosiecosy: Phillip Davis MP has just said coalition was at an end.” As you can see from his tie in UKIP colours!
Due to me being in the Commons fighting Bedroom Tax, my Constituency advice surgery will be later than usual at 6.30pm - trains allowing!
In House backing Bedroom Tax reform. Labour will then try to amend Bill to axe Tax. If Lib Dems don't back us, a Labour Gov will axe Tax.
@lukerigg digging their heels in despite lawyers including most senior judge telling them there is a better way to get more convictions.
What's the point of having a joint committee scrutinise the Modern Slavery Bill and make unanimous suggestions if Gov simply then ignore?
All day in Modern Slavery bill committee arguing for clearer offences & specific offences for child trafficking & exploitation. Gov refuses.
Seems to be good debate going on in the Commons Chamber on puppy farming. I'm attending further Committee sessions of Modern Slavery Bill.
@kdnicho I've passed the updated information that you e-mailed to me this morning onto Downing Street. @David_Cameron
In DECC Questions just praised latest progress on Siemens Hull. Condemned UKIP who'd prefer jobs to go abroad and Green talk of boycott.
@BBCr4today @David_Cameron doesn't mention that no-one is currently on a TPIM.
Shocking figures show 413% increase in primary school class sizes over 30 in Hull under the Coalition since 2010.
Just asked @David_Cameron to look at the case of my Hull North constituent @kdnicho who is stuck in Iraq. #PMQs http://t.co/4FZT4KtXmn
@CadzowRoy yes already been identified in Rochdale, North Wales care homes & Oxford. Children Commissioner says in communities all over UK.
@looknorthBBC Chief Exec Phil Morley who left Hull Royal Infirmary before a poor CQC report is now  back in NHS on £175k with £8k relocation
Speaking to @BBCRadioWales about child abuse issues and the Rotherham report.
@kdnicho Will be getting back to FCO about this latest setback and I'll try to raise your plight on the floor of the House of Commons.
On @BBCWorldatOne shortly about the Home Secretary's response to Labour's Urgent Question on child abuse, following the Rotherham report.
Will be on BBC @daily_politics shortly to discuss actions taken and needed following the Rotherham child abuse report.
Leading for the Labour Party in the first Committee session of the Modern Slavery Bill.
A minor Parliamentary victory to report. After years of me raising the issue, I can now receive @looknorthBBC at my Commons office!
A good day to remember that the universal free school meal idea was pioneered by Labour in Hull 10 years ago - then axed by the Lib Dems.
@kdnicho please let me know what happens tomorrow. Hope all goes well for you.
To everyone contacting me about @pupaid debate this week I fully support it. But I am in the Modern Slavery Bill  committee on Thursday.
Just spoke to @CNN about anti-terror laws.
After I contacted FCO again today I hope that my consistent @kdnicho will now be able to get home from Iraq very soon.
This evening I will discuss what we want to see in the Modern Slavery Bill with @THFabians.
PM says Control Orders were run ragged in courts. This is untrue Control Orders were upheld by the courts including the power of relocation.
Excellent question to PM from Hazel Blears Mp on need to put resources into communities to work with young people at risk of radicalisation.
About to speak to @BBCNews channel about anti-terror powers.
Concerned to hear of further unjustifiable delays in getting my constituent @kdnicho out of Iraq. Will continue raising case at Westminster.
Will be discussing our anti-terror powers in light of raised threat level on @BBCWorldatOne today.
@SkyNews Re your reports: Courts upheld Control Order relocation powers - so no credible legal challenge. Lib Dems oppose them, not courts.
2 surgeries in last 24 hours & overriding issues-lack of fairness in Governments policies 4 disabled & families struggling 2 make ends meet.
Speaking on @SkyNews after 1pm on the terror threat facing the UK and measures needed to protect the public.
About to speak to @LBC about child protection following the Rotherham report.
Great to talk to Helen @ slavefreecity at my surgery in Hull. Real concern we strengthen the Modern Slavery Bill as it goes through Commons.
@MartinJDeane @mozillatewildly @bbcburnsy Martin why don't you have a look at the transcript of your #carcrash interview?
On way to my open surgery for Hull North constituents at Asda in Kingswood.
@mozillatewildly @MartinJDeane @bbcburnsy I suggest you actually listen to the interview.
@mozillatewildly @MartinJDeane please do not tell lies I heard very clearly what Martin Deane said on @bbcburnsy about boycotting Siemens.
@RadioHumberside @bbcburnsy After years of work getting green jobs to Hull the Greens want to boycott Siemens? You couldn't make it up!

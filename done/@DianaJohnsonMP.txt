I note that Nick Clegg still thinks that having Lib Dems in government has democratic legitimacy - even if they finish 4th or 5th! Sat Apr 25 09:05:37 BST 2015

@nusuk I want to see @Hull2017 leave a lasting legacy locally, with new jobs and opportunities for students and residents alike. Wed Mar 11 13:48:40 GMT 2015
@nusuk One suggestion: Labour will give 16 & 17 year olds the vote, providing a say in our democracy & encouraging positive habits early. Wed Mar 11 13:45:28 GMT 2015
@nusuk We can all guess, but we should listen to what young people say themselves on what they think can be done to modernise our democracy. Wed Mar 11 13:44:00 GMT 2015
@nusuk  ...better apprenticeships, crackdown on Zero Hours Contracts & much else. Wed Mar 11 13:41:39 GMT 2015
@nusuk Cutting bills from tuition fees to energy, fairer private rents, enforcing/ raising minimum wage, expanding Living Wage... Wed Mar 11 13:40:51 GMT 2015
@nusuk  This needs wider range of measures than can be put into a few tweets! For example… Wed Mar 11 13:39:44 GMT 2015

@nusuk  Labour will expand high quality apprenticeships, house-building, infrastructure, digital, green energy – all have jobs potential. Wed Mar 11 13:29:40 GMT 2015
@nusuk   Labour will repeal Health and Social Care Act, employ 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs, 5,000 more careworkers. Wed Mar 11 13:26:33 GMT 2015
@nusuk   Labour will cut tuition fees to £6k p.a. This is a realistic promise we will keep. Labour won’t do a Clegg! Wed Mar 11 13:24:02 GMT 2015
@nusuk  It’s clear that we have to look at opportunities from nursery age through to being able to get on the housing ladder. Wed Mar 11 13:23:25 GMT 2015

Hull MP slams fall in prosecutions of child sex abusers under Coalition. My #PMQ yesterday - http://t.co/aqDmPuN4yB. http://t.co/fg6ZlB9gwY Thu Mar 05 13:15:27 GMT 2015
While Cameron has cut 16,000 police officers he has increase the number of civil servants in the Home Office #PMQs http://t.co/Acpay6kcur Wed Mar 04 12:19:39 GMT 2015
Theresa May has cut over 8000 frontline policing roles, but still employs 42 Home Office press officers #PMQs Wed Mar 04 12:19:16 GMT 2015
As a proportion of offences reported to the police, child abuse convictions are down a third under this Government (2/2) #PMQs Wed Mar 04 12:18:43 GMT 2015
The number of child abuse offences reported to the police is UP by 8000 the number of convictions is DOWN by 800 (1/2) #PMQs Wed Mar 04 12:18:24 GMT 2015
David Cameron’s record on child abuse: reports to police up, but cases handed to the CPS and convictions down #PMQs http://t.co/IhQJA9Q3sV Wed Mar 04 12:17:56 GMT 2015
@Emma_Hoddinott @UKIPactivist age appropriate relationship and sex education is absolutely right and helps to keep children safe too Tue Mar 03 14:42:24 GMT 2015
Too little, too late from the Government on tackling child abuse - see http://t.co/oAuNmUSmJE. Tue Mar 03 14:31:29 GMT 2015
@UKIPactivist @Emma_Hoddinott teaching about respectful and loving relationships must be at the heart of education on sex and relationships. Tue Mar 03 14:28:44 GMT 2015
Why doesn't Government accept Labours plans 4 mandatory reporting, compulsory sex & relationship education & a child exploitation offence Tue Mar 03 13:05:32 GMT 2015
Also Government have again failed to accept that a specific offence of child exploitation would make it easier to prosecute criminals. Tue Mar 03 13:02:09 GMT 2015
So disappointed that Secretary of State for Education still doesn't accept need for compulsory sex and relationship education in all schools Tue Mar 03 13:00:04 GMT 2015

@jpm287 well you haven't answered my question as to why so little action by this government ? Tue Feb 24 10:16:41 GMT 2015
@jpm287 Labour brought in minimum wage opposed by Tories. Tory/Lib Dems have been in power for last 5 years why so little action? Tue Feb 24 09:47:26 GMT 2015

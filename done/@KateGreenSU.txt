@MinisterDisPpl claims #PIP assessments will meet 'original timeframe/budget': http://t.co/ErpN40EQuu despite being 42 years behind schedule
PM says no artificial #PIP timeframe. Minister says original plan holds; 7k #DWP decisions pcm must reach 73k pcm immediately to hit target!
@dwppressoffice the #pmqs #PIP timeframe answer needs clarity. Penning reply today: #DWP will deliver original timescale/budget.Who's right?
@dwppressoffice #pmqs answer on artificial PIP timeframe unclear. Penning today says DWP will deliver original timescale/budget.Who's right?
PM says work is best route out of poverty, completely ignores that 2/3 of children in poverty live in working families #pmqs
PM says 'no artificial #PIP timetable' but Minister reply to me today says #DWP will still assess 1.7m ppl by '18 despite 42yr backlog #pmqs
Pleased @Ed_Miliband has raised delays in #passport agency in #pmqs. Anxious constituents in S&U won't be impressed with PM's response

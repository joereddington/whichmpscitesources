@amglarson thanks!
Struggling with poor mobile phone coverage in #Herefordshire? Tell me (& the Gov't) about it by doing my short survey http://t.co/MG4aOwFP0V
@D_Blanchflower actually I said "seems to" and "I think", in trying to make sense of your #WATO comments.
@D_Blanchflower er, no, David... possibly you have misunderstood?
@D_Blanchflower umm, maybe it's you who are misrepresenting me?
@D_Blanchflower @citizenandreas apols http://t.co/5eqfan3GHt
@D_Blanchflower @citizenandreas here is the #WATO link: judge for yourself
Testimony from me and Pam Plummer of @Action4OurCare on patients in England denied their rights under Engllsh #NHS https://t.co/V6KBPeVBbS
@citizenandreas @D_Blanchflower I think that is his argument. But Wolf in effect suggests that it fails, because global problems too deep
@citizenandreas @D_Blanchflower there was, I think. David seems to argue for fiscal reflation and interest rate rises in 2010-12
In other words, Blanchflower's idea that somehow interest rates shd have gone up in 2010-12 in order to come down now is hopeless 2/2
Martin Wolf in @ft today: "Extreme policy has been so ineffective b/c economies suffer such deep-seated ailments."  Correct 1/2
After my #WATO argument w/@D_Blanchflower, @martinwolf_ @FT today provides a near-total demolition of DB's position http://t.co/RmazfB8XcR

@JananGanesh @NoelGallagher @absoluteradio @IanWright0 how old were you at the time?
@SignRiteUKLtd thanks!
@maxrothbarth @BBCRadio4 no, no. Correct criticism is that we were far too vulnerable b/c Labour ran huge budget deficit at top of the cycle
@tankedup04 are you a constituent of mine? If so please write to me via http://t.co/2qZKQaToPr with your concerns
@duncstod86 @BBCRadio4 thank you
@D_Blanchflower yet on the show you seemed to imply it was a mistake... when do you think rates should've gone up since then?
I'll be speaking about the UK economy and global headwinds on @BBCRadio4 #WATO around 1.15 pm today

Very very sorry to hear that Cllr Olwen Barnett has passed away. Olwen was just magnificent, and this is a huge loss for Herefordshire.
@DigbySdiary sorry--missed your tweet. I have been campaigning on this issue since 2008, e.g. http://t.co/0KZiXWPKWz
@Bruno_Fits @SHYPP1 done! congratulations

@TheSophieGooch I am so sorry. When is that?
@hselftax thanks!

@RBHamilton1 @ConservativesWM Thanks!  That was an annual report--this is for the past four years.
@Hfd_RollerGirls got it, but slightly busy with one or two other things! V pleased to RT
@OllyHuitson @OurNHS_oD thanks
@DickWinchester @stephenboydstuc we asked about the legislation due to take effect in 2015 allowing Scots to raise money directly
I will be speaking to @bbchw at 5.40 pm re #HUFC
@leonoramerry @IanBlunt78 yes please! I would be very interested to do so. How should I get in touch--or will you email me?
@DickWinchester @stephenboydstuc not at all; it's the testimony of Robert Stheeman, drawing on the collective view and experience of the DMO
@stephenboydstuc yes; the transcript will be published shortly on the TSC website
Good meeting earlier with @FA. They've got the message & understand the issues. Real progress w/ #ODT enforcement on McCarthy. More needed!
TSC: Debt Mgmt Office says Scotland will have to issue £10bn ScotGilts in order not to pay an extra cost for illiquidity. Spread 100+ bps?
@clarercgp the paper is at http://t.co/qQophiwyaQ. You'll see it focuses on how more and better information can improve use of the NHS
@Olive1309 @OurNHS_oD in case you have not read the paper, emphasis is on better use
@Prof_Anil_Jain @clarercgp @OurNHS_oD @mellojonny @butNHS @KailashChandOBE actually our proposal fits well w/much current best CCG practice
@mgtmccartney @mellojonny @colinwforster @OurNHS_oD Vickers Commission testified to me/Treas Cttee that banks' annual subsidy was £10-£50bn
@leonoramerry @IanBlunt78 this is helpful; thank you. I was not aware of Phillip's earlier proposal--should have been
@mellojonny @colinwforster @mgtmccartney @OurNHS_oD NB also about other options: GP v A&E, use of pharmacies, telemedicine, social care
@OurNHS_oD @mellojonny @clarercgp @butNHS @KailashChandOBE Paper says *use*. It's about how we can use the NHS better--an important question
@IanBlunt78 @NuffieldTrust @FT it says both and a lot more. You will see the paper focuses on "worried well" and very careful roll-out
@herefordlibdems it's not a bill. The point is precisely to improve use and allow more money to go into local healthcare
@OurNHS_oD yes I would be happy to do so.  How long, and where should I send it?
@carolinejmolloy @daveskid73 @mattleys @mellojonny @OurNHS_oD this is very misleading. These are not bills; paper discusses careful rollout
@wudzee0 sorry for the delay. I have Governance Cttee and other commitments but will try to attend for at least part
@FuzzyLogo bot at this notice, I am afraid. Are you a constituent? If so do email me via http://t.co/ZQxd087rSm and we will try to help
@CPSThinkTank @drwollastonmp and would prefer interactions to be mediated through GPs. This is precisely the kind of debate we shd be having
@CPSThinkTank @drwollastonmp has proper and serious concerns w/ sending any statements to users, wh the paper discusses in detail 3/3
@CPSThinkTank @drwollastonmp we also agree that this fits with current best practice among CCGs in identifying outliers 2/3
@CPSThinkTank @drwollastonmp and I agree about the importance of bringing data together, perhaps incl. (over-) prescription data 1/3
@mellojonny @carolinejmolloy easy to see a GP reviewing a statement with a v vulnerable patient and encouraging better use w/better outcomes
@buletproofcardi @DavidGWrigley @cpeedell in fact HMT has saved £2bn on PFI since 2010. Problem is contracts cannot be abolished
@mellojonny @carolinejmolloy 2/2 wh would be especially valuable to the most vulnerable patients
@mellojonny @carolinejmolloy thanks Jonathan. Striking how far statements could *enable* more cooperative working 1/2
@marieannswift @carolinejmolloy @NHAparty I agree, of course
@carolinejmolloy @mellojonny suggest you read the paper, if you have not yet done so
@DavidGWrigley @cpeedell suggest you read my paper on the evils of PFI on http://t.co/3MPdeKrXCl
@willshome @Archangelolill have you read the paper?
@Archangelolill have you read the paper?
@DavidGWrigley thanks. Paper specifically acknowledges a concern in this area and argues for careful implementation
@Archangelolill I do! Take a look at my Parliamentary Report on http://t.co/5cG9N09xrm
@davidsocialsp @carolinejmolloy on the contrary, the point of looking at use is in part to develop stronger relationships based on knowledge
@CallingEngland actually no. Suggest you read the paper
@DavidGWrigley no--suggest you read the paper
@mattleys @hewnique @richardblogger @carolinejmolloy of course not. Cd save £1bn in unnecessary over-use, missed appointments etc.
@narboroughlad @carolinejmolloy certainly not. Very strongly against that
@timburrows19 praise indeed! :)
Greatly looking forward to introducing @EconTalker, who will be speaking about Adam Smith and his Theory of Moral Sentiments in HoC at 1 pm
@timburrows19 thanks!
@Lukehindhaugh  no Luke. I believe very strongly in accountability for MPs, cf. https://t.co/filGTO1gkv. But the amendment was wrong.
Treasury Cttee hears serious concerns from #ACCA, #ICAEW and #CIT about workability, complexity, burden, cost, avoidance on Scots Income Tax
@declamare @politicshome @DJSkelton because we have a representative democracy, in which we turf out MPs for cause or at elections
@CBeale1 Brilliant catch! Well done

@linds_alder hi--no thanks. I took it to be a private meeting.
@bbclaurak @ChiOnwurah certainly not! Terrific regular feedback, yes, but not a comprehensive four year account of hits and misses
@drjohnsonshouse thank you. It was a great evening, a great audience and a great venue.
@closehousehfd yes! Wish I could be with you. Massive good luck. I will help separately.
Looking forward to addressing #ArtsCouncilEngland chiefs shortly in Brum. Going to give them a big push on helping #Herefordshire!

Delighted that Theresa May is looking hard at the injustices created by long/indefinite bail.

@paulwaugh 2/2 "But authoritative instructions... arise from a fundamental mistake of the whole order and tenor of our constitution."
@paulwaugh 1/2 "that of constituents is a weighty and respectable opinion, which a representative ought always to rejoice to hear"

@gilbertharman Just come across your fascinating Lindley Lecture 1986 "Moral Agent and Impartial Spectator". Thank you.
@CBeale1 indeed. But at least the previous Clerk has said he put "robust arrangements in place" to cover the interim period.
@JGForsyth No--we have not seen any proposals yet. If the work is properly scoped the timetable may be fine.
However people's views may differ on Scotland or the Union, constitutional reform must not be rushed.
@GTrefers yes I did, when it first came out.  I wish I had written it!
@GTrefers Ah... the trouble is everything has already been said, many times over, and with increasing volume and aggression. #notmystyle
@GTrefers about what?
Scotland gets £10,152 per head. Wales, despite being much poorer, gets £9,709. England gets £8,529. @TimMontgomerie http://t.co/C38NWOcqyO

@EdConwaySky I was using @NIESRorg numbers as illustration, and mentioned FX reserves. He did use 100%+ tho', while hedging on parallels
If #Scotland shared a currency as Hong Kong does, its reserves would need to be c. £40-£45bn. i.e. roughly double what they are now.
Carney to TSC: "countries which run successful currency sharing generally have large reserves" #Scotland
Very good news that the UK has secured the Financial Services brief in the EU Commission for Jonathan Hill. That's a real win.
I've now written to the Minister to follow up key points raised in my backbench debate on the future of #Nonleaguefootball #herefordunited

@NickVaughan7 thanks!
@Jezzy1973 thanks!
@ChrisPhillips_ thanks!

@MattQuinn75 thank you, Matt. Very kind of you to say that.
@simmo_on_sport @FA thanks
@Jimofhereford @BullsNewsBlog Thanks Jim. But I have always been behind it. Send me your proposal and I will of course look at it.
@SHELDONSCHEF thank you!
@andyhamamatsu sorry, auto-complete snafu!  Non-League...
Very good turnout and some terrific speeches at my debate on Non-Legal Football
@bbchw @BullsNewsBlog Current debate running slightly late so Non-League Football will too. May be more like 2.30 pm.
Delighted to announce that debate on a new Select Cttee on Governance of HoC, to report Jan '14, will be next Weds. http://t.co/AxQfzR9weC
Grateful to the Speaker for confirming in @FT that if the roles of the Clerk are split, both will be re-advertised. http://t.co/nLQnDT6plk
@HerefordshireFA @nonleagueshow thanks!
@SusieBoyt thanks. I am allergic to metaphor where precision is needed... luckily not elsewhere.
Sir Nicholas Macpherson now in front of the Treasury Committee. Shd be interesting.
Today colleagues and I will put a motion to the Backbench Business Cttee to set up temp select cttee on splitting CEO/COO roles #Clerkship
@deemontague @MikeHobday @HouseofCommons @macmillancancer blimey. How awful. Anything I can do to help, let me know.
@deemontague @MikeHobday @HouseofCommons @macmillancancer Yes ma'am! I made the first intervention.
@RNC_official ... But the fight continues!
@jackpalmer88 @nonleagueshow thanks!
Speaker's Office have confirmed that he will take Points of Order on his statement today, after the PM's statement has finished. #Clerkship
I understand the #Speaker WILL make a statement at 2.30 pm today on the #Clerkship.
It was great to meet Kelsey Francis and her @NCS @Engage4Life National Citizen Service team on Sat at @KindleCentre http://t.co/IcVdxmgF70
@DavidHeathMP on the Clerkship: "Change this big should be decided by the House" http://t.co/QrGIf2IRen >> he is absolutely right
@ChukaUmunna any thoughts on my #IceBucketChallenge? :)
I will be talking to @bbchw after 8.10 am today about my motion on the Clerkship of the House of Commons. Op-ed here http://t.co/1Od4QOswd0
"Think again, Mr Speaker": op-ed by me in the Mail on Sunday today http://t.co/1Od4QOswd0
@bendlea @bgrovegossip @BBCOne a little late for me! But to answer your question, defo Ant and Dec http://t.co/Cdrd8CHqWH

@sueihaworth v kind of you. But there are crucial constitutional and governance issues involved.
Very pleased that four more MPs have joined our campaign on the Clerkship: Nigel Dodds, Cheryl Gillan, Nigel Evans and Rob Wilson. Total 78.
@unoshigeki @bencobley thank you very much. I would love to have a Japanese publisher for the book.
Delighted to hear @SYMONDS79 has joined Herefordshire FA as Football Coordinator (Schools). What a good man, and the perfect role for him.
Supporters of our campaign re: new Clerk include 9 former ministers, 4 select committee chairmen, 3 former government whips and 11 PPSs
I have now submitted my EDM on the appointment of the new Clerk. @nengelmp is the con-sponsor. http://t.co/rXqGQHBRfV Pls RT if you agree

Still feeling the #IceBucketChallenge. But I haven't heard yet if @ChukaUmunna accepts my challenge... @themusicpool http://t.co/PxbjnNLqRu
@clivewilcock @Llwynaumawr that is correct
Aaaarrrgghhh... feeling the full pain of the #IceBucketChallenge. Proceeds to @themusicpool. I challenge Lab's King of Cool, @ChukaUmunna :)
I'll be speaking to @bbchw at 8.45 am today about my charity walks across Herefordshire to raise money for Air Ambulance and the #RNC.
Drat! Should have checked the weather before accepting the #IceBucketChallenge! Weston Cross Inn c. 1 pm today... not too smart.
Busted... I'll be taking the #IceBucketChallenge tomorrow after my charity walk. 1 pm-ish at the Weston Cross Inn. Be there!!
Serious concern that to proceed with the appointment of Carol Mills now that terms of reference may be changed cd lead to judicial review.
Really looking forward to the game at 2 pm today between Mayor's Charity XI and Hfd Utd Supporters. At Hinton FC. Shd be a cracker.
Huge turnout at Herefordshire Food Fair on Castle Green! http://t.co/bmyRIOzlsC
@TimMontgomerie I love that line: 'This was the first time in 30 years I had been called “shy”'! That's @GNev2, not van Gaal. But cd be both
@LouiseMensch thank you, Louise
To be clear: if the champion of Parliament does not give Parliament a say on Ms Mills' appointment, I will table a motion on this on Sept 1.
My @HTnewsroom column is on my walks next week to raise money for Air Ambulance and RNCB. To come contact @DeserterLee via arthurlee@sky.com

@PsychedelicTony @BullsNewsBlog thank you. But we must keep moving forwards
@KeithHallSport @YourHereford1 @eddyman00 @HfdsCouncil NO. I believe all Councillors want to support well-run long-term football at Edgar St
@peoffrey It has been an honour to be able to help.  Not over yet though by any means.
@eddyman00 thanks--yes indeed. The Council has had to go carefully for legal reasons. But no Councillor wants to lose football at Edgar St.
@eddyman00 @HerefordUnited1 I want football to stay at Edgar St. But NB I am not a councillor and have no formal powers over the Council.
@rcheeso @LWLS1924 We don't know the full facts, only that he seems to have failed FA's "fit and proper" test. The CVA is proceeding...

@Vicky_Styles16 fantastic! Thank you so much Mon Apr 27 14:04:28 BST 2015
@SimmondsMills the point is that democratic politics makes no claim to scientific objectivity. And it's not paid by the taxpayer to do so. Mon Apr 27 13:05:35 BST 2015
@SimmondsMills alas Simon's political preferences are all too obvious. Such a shame in a profession that aspires to scientific objectivity. Mon Apr 27 12:56:59 BST 2015
@bikeral72 thanks Alan. Really appreciate it. Now if you could go out and persuade any other waverers out there... :) Mon Apr 27 12:55:28 BST 2015

Fantastic game--and massive congratulations to Jamie Febery! https://t.co/i7PpcAoYy4 Sat Apr 25 19:07:25 BST 2015
And now another absolute peach, from Craig Jones. Left footer curled round the keeper. 4-0! This is a rout. Sat Apr 25 16:41:06 BST 2015
Two superb goals back to back for #Westfields, from Joel Edwards and Jamie Cuss. Now 3-0. Sat Apr 25 16:38:49 BST 2015
Ooops! Scorer was in fact Marcus Palmer. Thanks to @nibbo1 for providing the conclusive evidence! Sat Apr 25 16:01:55 BST 2015
Great #Westfields game vs Loughborough University. 1-0 with neatly worked goal by Craig Jones. Westfields pretty dominant so far. Sat Apr 25 15:40:54 BST 2015

@GarethWareth eh? What is this about? Thu Apr 16 15:07:44 BST 2015
@GarethWareth but we need to improve quality and pay of local jobs. Why not get behind the university project instead of criticising? 3/ Thu Apr 16 15:06:39 BST 2015
@GarethWareth I've held 3 Jobs Fairs to help local people needing jobs and launched the university project. Cf https://t.co/gIpTLwdw2o 2/ Thu Apr 16 15:04:19 BST 2015

@hselftax there are such problems, yes; but this isn't one of them. This is a natural language problem which requires logical reasoning. Thu Apr 16 10:36:30 BST 2015
@hselftax @BBCr4today that's a very interesting view. But NB my word "explicit" Thu Apr 16 08:50:39 BST 2015

@SJ_Preece @HerefordFC thank you Tue Apr 14 07:53:02 BST 2015
@AlasdairMSmith @jdportes Maybe so. But Layard's claim is that "Labour’s budgets were not irresponsible". That's clearly false. Mon Apr 13 20:09:57 BST 2015
@AlasdairMSmith @jdportes must also be seen in context: four linked booms in immigration, house prices, gvmt borrowing, personal debt Mon Apr 13 16:33:03 BST 2015
@Independent on appalling effects of PFI on NHS. Margaret Hodge quite right to say Labour "seduced by PFI" http://t.co/ARs43nVKfK Mon Apr 13 16:30:00 BST 2015
@jdportes @AlasdairMSmith even worse; conventional AND wrong. Shd not have run deficits at the top of the cycle; & bank borrowing exploded Mon Apr 13 16:26:57 BST 2015
@AlasdairMSmith @econromesh @CEP_LSE happy to provide of course; but this is mere deflection. The present Q is whether Layard is right. Mon Apr 13 15:34:48 BST 2015
@AlasdairMSmith @econromesh @CEP_LSE I notice you are not defending Layard's misleading comments. Mon Apr 13 15:26:45 BST 2015

@Dannythefink that's an extremely interesting analysis, Danny--thanks. Might be worth a col? Thu Feb 12 09:06:42 GMT 2015
And the more people searched for info online, the less likely they were to vote for independence--Univ Glasgow http://t.co/JbVCNYuj46 2/2 Thu Feb 12 08:48:52 GMT 2015
Wow. The Vow made no difference to the outcome of the Scottish referendum, acc. to the University of Glasgow http://t.co/JbVCNYuj46 1/2 Thu Feb 12 08:47:17 GMT 2015
@ian_mcdonald thanks. It was a really nice crowd, and a great evening. So nice to talk ideas and not slogans. Hats off to JP! Thu Feb 12 08:38:50 GMT 2015
Good crowd here at the Boogaloo in Highgate. Kick-off shortly. Guinness in hand.  Should be a great evening to talk all things Burke Wed Feb 11 20:07:12 GMT 2015
@colinwforster @nw_nicholas sorry--had not realised had that effect. You can RT now if desired. I will leave unblocked for the time being Wed Feb 11 10:32:36 GMT 2015
… and you wonder why I will not “engage” with you. This is why. 9/9 Wed Feb 11 09:31:50 GMT 2015
In so doing you have accused me **with no factual basis whatever** of hypocrisy, corruption, and complicity in fraud 8/9 Wed Feb 11 09:31:19 GMT 2015
… you were wrong to troll me on Twitter; you were wrong to slander me online repeatedly, without any evidence. 7/9 Wed Feb 11 09:31:05 GMT 2015
… you were wrong to put my good-faith, truthful and constructive private reply to your original inquiry, sent in confidence, online 6/9 Wed Feb 11 09:30:49 GMT 2015
You ignored my original statement that this should properly be handled through the Treasury Committee staff 5/9 Wed Feb 11 09:30:05 GMT 2015
But you are not a constituent of mine, and I am not your representative. 4/9 Wed Feb 11 09:29:34 GMT 2015
You seem to have taken a principled stand to blow the whistle on #HSBC, and you have clearly been under huge pressure as a result. 3/9 Wed Feb 11 09:29:23 GMT 2015
… and it is a potentially serious embarrassment for the #FCA, which I will continue to press, in the public interest. 2/9 Wed Feb 11 09:29:05 GMT 2015
@nw_nicholas Dear Mr Wilson, you have been right to press this allegation of mis-selling by #HSBC. It is a very serious matter 1/9 Wed Feb 11 09:28:43 GMT 2015
@snowyred96 @nw_nicholas thank you Wed Feb 11 08:16:39 GMT 2015

@BenSummerskill thank you Tue Feb 10 08:29:17 GMT 2015

@diane1859 2/2 both cannot help both accepting and disavowing the distinctive small-c conservatism in Burke's thought. Politics obtruding! Tue Feb 03 08:31:27 GMT 2015
@diane1859 Hampsher-Monk is a great Burke scholar and the piece is excellent, as is Bromwich's book. But what is so fascinating is how 1/2 Tue Feb 03 08:28:52 GMT 2015
Magnificent Thought for the Day just now. Thank you Anne Atkins. Tue Feb 03 07:54:05 GMT 2015

@scarlett81 I met and pressed the previous owners to fix it, and have been urging the Council to slap an enforcement action on them as well Mon Feb 02 14:42:01 GMT 2015

@LukeJohnFrost his comments are often disowned even by the Lab candidate. He's not pleasant and best ignored. Don't let him bother you! Sun Apr 26 01:15:31 BST 2015
@mattbrown43 I don't think he is! Hope he has a nice birthday though. Sat Apr 25 19:46:45 BST 2015

@MasonBreen http://t.co/uPoBy73YB9 Thu Apr 23 23:15:04 BST 2015
@MasonBreen no ones talking about closing it, just eg changing the roundabout at broomhill Av end to lights to stop right of way etc. Thu Apr 23 23:13:02 BST 2015
@MasonBreen wasn't a problem before road joined up and humps removed. Was never meant to be a shortcut and we are changing it to address. Thu Apr 23 22:40:47 BST 2015
@MasonBreen no but use of this road as a shortcut has been a long running problem for residents there. Thu Apr 23 21:11:10 BST 2015

@NiBeyls This is a target seat! Tue Apr 21 22:05:55 BST 2015
The Labour candidate could not attend tonight's hustings because of a clash... But was posting things on Facebook throughout? Tue Apr 21 21:46:54 BST 2015

@cameronbrownuk @WikiGuido shouldnt*! Sun Apr 19 13:07:47 BST 2015
@cameronbrownuk @WikiGuido there's no "only" about politics but it should be personal like that. Can disagree without being disagreeable :) Sun Apr 19 13:06:56 BST 2015
@WikiGuido taking it a bit too personally I fear! Sun Apr 19 13:04:52 BST 2015

@horizons80 @50for15 indeed. It's not a valley. Fri Apr 10 08:07:05 BST 2015
@50for15 nice to meet you all.  Hope you enjoy your tour of constituencies :) Thu Apr 09 21:51:08 BST 2015
@MSmithsonPB from what I understand (and saw here) the main Lab election address went out last week. Possible factor. Seems early to me! Thu Apr 09 08:23:00 BST 2015
Jobs growth is narrowing the North/South divide. Teesside is on the right track and we must not risk that progress. http://t.co/Msf1lgzyrU Thu Apr 09 06:31:12 BST 2015
@ClarkeyBeags fair point. Thu Apr 09 00:12:18 BST 2015
@GwynneMP I think you'll find you started it, but hey, I suspect we won't see you here again so I guess it doesn't matter much. Gnight. Wed Apr 08 22:22:07 BST 2015
@GwynneMP oh dear I am sorry. You're still rather nasty petty and bitter though. Wed Apr 08 22:19:03 BST 2015
@GwynneMP you missed 30% of votes, that actually have an impact. All irrelevant stats some might say, hope your NHS plans better considered. Wed Apr 08 22:16:39 BST 2015
@GwynneMP I don't know what makes you guys so bitter and personal but it's just one more reason you aren't fit for government I suppose :) Wed Apr 08 22:05:41 BST 2015
@phil_sidney I wish I had the luxury of such time! :) Wed Apr 08 21:59:41 BST 2015
@GwynneMP sorry I didn't recognise you. It's that high profile you have! Wed Apr 08 21:59:20 BST 2015

@apravda whilst I am supportive of Ukraine I don't think (if I have translated correctly) arresting journalists is a good idea. Fri Apr 03 21:37:07 BST 2015
@Smogmonster10 its your vote, but around here you only help labour and miliband by doing that! Fri Apr 03 09:26:27 BST 2015

@17reidy ok I'll support it if it will genuinely help but its more a council issue so... @BenHouchen will need to help too. Tue Mar 31 19:19:47 BST 2015
@17reidy very happy to look at this but they've not contacted me.  Can you send details and I'll look into it properly? #noshallowpromises Tue Mar 31 18:31:11 BST 2015

@holg8 good idea! Sun Mar 29 22:09:38 BST 2015

@JoBooth10 needs serious investment. Read my plan :) Sat Mar 28 16:21:59 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 I'm not sure what you don't understand. It's both. We saved it but Labour want to bring back plans to close it. Sat Mar 28 16:20:18 GMT 2015
@johnnield2 not me though I am not far away! Sat in The Fairfield pub. Sat Mar 28 15:44:05 GMT 2015

Interesting adjournment debate by @NormanBakerMP, Lib Dems worried about Lewes? http://t.co/DS2OR14DBY Tue Mar 03 19:12:16 GMT 2015
@MimSkinner great, happy to come in sometime if you like :) Mon Mar 02 14:53:48 GMT 2015
Quite a clever way to get MPs attention pre budget from @droptheduty to send a whisky miniature in the post! http://t.co/g5KysgNtQE Mon Mar 02 09:35:13 GMT 2015
@Manguish fair enough, but at least you know, so that you know whether you do or don't :) Sun Mar 01 17:08:06 GMT 2015
@Manguish at least you get stuff, even if you don't like me you know what I'm doing and want to do :) Sun Mar 01 16:05:58 GMT 2015
@LordAshcroft someone used to say don't look at the gap, look at the shares... @MSmithsonPB Sat Feb 28 21:20:50 GMT 2015
@GeorginaYEP @spider987 @StocktonGreenP let's not encourage them too much!! :) Sat Feb 28 17:36:19 GMT 2015
After a good morning campaigning great to visit @MuseYarm, always a friendly welcome :) Sat Feb 28 15:54:21 GMT 2015
Good of @danielrhamilton to come up and join us in Eaglescliffe, team not finding many Lib Dem voters these days! http://t.co/NXWZAsXwkZ Sat Feb 28 13:35:12 GMT 2015
@JHind83 @NPAS_TeesValley good stuff. I am working on some things behind the scenes, long shot tho. Fri Feb 27 21:53:24 GMT 2015
@JayKay4Action let's not go too far, I can do it rather than like it :) Fri Feb 27 17:06:42 GMT 2015
@JayKay4Action yes I can! :p Fri Feb 27 16:42:43 GMT 2015
@spider987 sadly you might be going @StocktonGreenP then?  If you want to meet to discuss Id be happy to sometime :) Fri Feb 27 14:39:10 GMT 2015
Good stuff from @ConyersSchool taking pupils to Oxford today, including meeting some of their former pupils who are studying there. Fri Feb 27 13:21:58 GMT 2015
.@George_Osborne giving strong backing to @TVU_LEP and combined authority. "Door is open". Fri Feb 27 12:21:45 GMT 2015
Teesside Enterprise Zone to expand to oil * gas decom work, ¬£Ms for engineer training + education investment. Export focused trade missions. Fri Feb 27 12:19:17 GMT 2015
In Eaglescliffe today @George_Osborne talking of ¬£4.5Bn for NE Transport, 50k more jobs, ¬£2k per person economy boost and APD review. Fri Feb 27 12:15:45 GMT 2015
Great to have @George_Osborne in Eaglescliffe to launch our long term economic plan for the NE. http://t.co/i7MuiFlwq5 Fri Feb 27 12:09:20 GMT 2015
@BaxterGreystock ive had a detailed discussion with them, it's not black and white but I am sympathetic in part. Fri Feb 27 10:27:40 GMT 2015
Really good visit to the International Fire Training Centre at Teesside Airport with the Defence Secretary. http://t.co/nC5yhMYtYY Thu Feb 26 17:30:35 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 that might be asking a bit much. Thanks for taking the time to tweet :) Mon Feb 23 18:25:01 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 That is true, depends really. I have cleaned grubby signs myself on occasion! Mon Feb 23 18:16:01 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 well a lot of the "cost" is already established with council teams that exist so the only additional cost would be the roundup Mon Feb 23 18:14:35 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 ah yes, so what is it you want? Sorry I'm a bit confused by your comment. Mon Feb 23 18:07:50 GMT 2015
@thelowestrung @EveningGazette @MikePannett indeed- 14% cut to NPAS, 100% cut to Cleveland helicopter service- poor effort by Barry. Mon Feb 23 17:57:24 GMT 2015
@JoBooth10 email me details if you like? Mon Feb 23 17:56:43 GMT 2015
Poor Barry Coppingers made such a mess of the Cleveland Police Helicopter issue Labour MPs from outside the area are trying to defend him! Mon Feb 23 16:28:41 GMT 2015
@benglaze @Conor_BurnsMP @TheNorthernEcho all the other photos in the gallery are broader landscape pics because only this one was cropped. Sun Feb 22 14:41:36 GMT 2015
@JHind83 ok sorry for any misunderstanding in that case. Sun Feb 22 14:11:42 GMT 2015
The @TheNorthernEcho actively cut me from this photo but forgot to remove me from the caption. Hmm... http://t.co/3x90wveAEv Sun Feb 22 14:11:18 GMT 2015
@JHind83 already spoken out against it, tho not in Parl as not a Parl decision. If there is a way to get Barry to rethink I'm up for trying. Sun Feb 22 14:08:43 GMT 2015
@JHind83 2/2 could pretend I can stop this, get publicity and campaign and maybe your vote. But I can't. It's up to Barry and he's decided. Sun Feb 22 14:05:16 GMT 2015
@JHind83 you started saying why should someone vote for me then. It's totally unrelated, vote how you like but I'll be honest and open 1/2 Sun Feb 22 14:04:36 GMT 2015
@JHind83 you said will I "let this happen" and ive tried to explain who controls it and my position to you. Sun Feb 22 14:02:23 GMT 2015
@JHind83 haven't been rude, suggest you re read the thread. I've explained I oppose this and have raised it but that I don't control it. Sun Feb 22 14:01:02 GMT 2015
@JHind83 be like that if you want. I can and do change things but this "thing" is controlled by a different elected person. Sun Feb 22 13:54:15 GMT 2015
@JHind83 I've already spoke against it but really, your elected Police Commissioner decides this I have no control over it. Sun Feb 22 13:38:29 GMT 2015
@JHind83 I have no power to stop it! The Labour Cleveland Police Commissioner voted for it to happen :( Sun Feb 22 13:32:30 GMT 2015
An unusual angle on the Ukraine conflict. I'm not convinced, Putin is just a corrupt Cold War forged bully. http://t.co/dnUa1Bm1K4 Sun Feb 22 11:50:14 GMT 2015
@andy_c_brown no return, if true, is a decision by the trust board. Hartlepool people need to persuade them (inc their politicians). Sat Feb 21 17:57:26 GMT 2015
@andy_c_brown they are campaigning for more in the existing Hartlepool hospital, tho my focus is/has to be n tees. Sat Feb 21 17:08:17 GMT 2015
Another team out meeting residents in Stockton today. Great to have some new faces joining us :) http://t.co/eexWrUi7F3 Sat Feb 21 13:25:24 GMT 2015
@JesJoeJac ouch, and you used to be so nice :p Sat Feb 21 11:36:06 GMT 2015
@Spock_Thornaby I have already and they say not. Fri Feb 20 16:23:51 GMT 2015
@Daveyboy89 haha thanks, though I don't think they do that as they don't want highly local issues on national show. Thu Feb 19 22:49:20 GMT 2015
@cfwesbro @BBCRichardMoss in fairness the piece is balanced. Thu Feb 19 22:24:17 GMT 2015
.@BBCRichardMoss I can't believe you let @edballsmp say "long term plan" and cut that bit out of my clip on Look North. He stole my line! :) Thu Feb 19 21:27:44 GMT 2015
Great to welcome Cleveland ACF to London for a visit to the Guards Museum today. http://t.co/D9hnbkFYLr Thu Feb 19 11:00:03 GMT 2015
@robert_g_oliver just ignore that troll, he doesn't even live in Stockton South! :) Wed Feb 18 13:08:35 GMT 2015
@WIHarrison thanks, I don't control things like that, though it is true and an important consideration. Point taken tho. Tue Feb 17 18:11:26 GMT 2015
@tsprog @NECCTom @FSBTeesValley @teesvalleybc now now be nice, we are civilised and not like the local Labour Internet trolls :) Tue Feb 17 16:45:26 GMT 2015
@StocktonGreenP @MikeBGazette not profitable as far as I know. Tue Feb 17 15:43:41 GMT 2015
Interesting article by @MikeBGazette showing how the Swallow looks inside years after closing. http://t.co/hzyFf5wls4 Tue Feb 17 13:04:55 GMT 2015
@neilbaldwin1983 @Simon4Boro there's a version at http://t.co/V2x1J6EIan :) Tue Feb 17 09:58:48 GMT 2015
@midroadpolitico but you guys are so much better at just adopting our policies :) Mon Feb 16 15:15:52 GMT 2015
@midroadpolitico I have three months to try to convince you to vote for me. You might prove one of the tougher ones to convert :) Sun Feb 15 22:42:27 GMT 2015
@MasonBreen they wanted 1200 but Stockton Council objected so got 600. You are right further expansion will be needed. Sat Feb 14 15:49:40 GMT 2015
@MasonBreen ultimately yes, that's why so many worked so hard to get the new free school secondary school. Sat Feb 14 15:18:52 GMT 2015
@MasonBreen both need schools and they've wanted a pool for as long as I can find records of our surveys in Yarm! Comes up less in Eaglescf. Sat Feb 14 13:49:10 GMT 2015
Another good turnout for a bit of #doorstep this afternoon :) http://t.co/43e0dBD8b1 Sat Feb 14 13:35:52 GMT 2015
@MasonBreen I mean the estate we know today, of course. The land and area is indeed much older. Sat Feb 14 13:34:56 GMT 2015
The @EveningGazette pictures the official opening of Ingleby Manor School are now online :) http://t.co/onD0A9bHWH Fri Feb 13 20:55:36 GMT 2015
@StocktonLibDems welcome to Twitter, and remember, we're all in it together ;) Fri Feb 13 17:31:19 GMT 2015
@ridsdaleishere I think you've misunderstood :) Fri Feb 13 17:26:03 GMT 2015
@neilbaldwin1983 haha afraid not. Looks an interesting lineup though! Fri Feb 13 17:17:31 GMT 2015
At Tesco in Ingleby Barwick for my surgery. Fri Feb 13 16:14:36 GMT 2015
Absolutely brilliant to be at the official opening of Ingleby Manor School.  Such an amazing place and achievement. Fri Feb 13 14:19:24 GMT 2015
@PaulBrandITV no autographs please ;) Thu Feb 12 23:09:09 GMT 2015
@janiebethB hi Janie, can you let me know where you love Plz as need to know of im your MP :) Thu Feb 12 08:29:17 GMT 2015
@LipDip91 sorry catching up with tweets and sent you wrong one. Lots but complex, can you email me? Wed Feb 11 22:42:03 GMT 2015
@RiversideRed_ that's more up to the council than me but if you send me an email I'll put it to them? James.wharton.mp@parliament.uk Wed Feb 11 22:41:27 GMT 2015
@LadyLesleyShaw not sure @BenHouchen do you know? Wed Feb 11 09:03:29 GMT 2015
@CllrGarethKane @iswales same in Stockton, must be using old copy as nothing new to say! Wed Feb 11 08:17:32 GMT 2015
@LukeJohnFrost Yup! Wynyard means closing N Tees and Hartlepool. They should defend it if that's their view, not try to muddy the waters. Tue Feb 10 20:52:05 GMT 2015
@LukeJohnFrost exactly Luke! They have been very clear about their position. Just playing games now the elections coming. Tue Feb 10 20:04:46 GMT 2015
@akrasodomski thank you :) Tue Feb 10 18:52:29 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy #labourdoorstep or not, as it happens. Tue Feb 10 13:21:07 GMT 2015
@Les5175 agree but more to do, and we do need to get funds for these schools looking forward, it's something I want to deliver :) Tue Feb 10 10:55:06 GMT 2015
@Les5175 programme looks a need and state of buildings, we need investment but they r structurally sound so othrs understandably got funds. Tue Feb 10 10:50:15 GMT 2015
@Les5175 that's not really a fair statement, we have had funding for a number of schools in this area from this programme 1/2 Tue Feb 10 10:48:46 GMT 2015
@melindiscott yup! Mon Feb 09 16:41:45 GMT 2015
@melindiscott @Ap ah my mistake it's a @pressassoc photo they appear to have used. I'd like to use it so have asked for a quote. Mon Feb 09 16:35:10 GMT 2015
@melindiscott @AP a direct lift of a copyright pic. Must have cost them hundreds, I will as AP what it cost as I have paid a lot in past. Mon Feb 09 16:24:40 GMT 2015
Labour now using pics of me in their leaflets.  I hope they've paid @AP for the rights. Mon Feb 09 16:21:49 GMT 2015
@joe_pattinson @aaron_bishop_ @stocktoncouncil thank you :) Sun Feb 08 23:56:58 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy I though you were supposed to be local!? Might as well be from Liverpool! Sun Feb 08 18:30:38 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy far too weak. Is your mum voting for you? Great response on #motherdoorstep? Sun Feb 08 18:28:04 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy too soft! No wonder you get such bad doorsteps. Sun Feb 08 18:22:24 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy @MarkJLittlewood @craigawoodhouse @richsimcox oh dear, a landslide #labourgain then. Odds are good, they can put some ¬£ on :) Sun Feb 08 16:42:05 GMT 2015
@PaulBrandITV @andrewpercy @MarkJLittlewood @craigawoodhouse there's enough good doorstep for everyone to enjoy. Sat Feb 07 20:29:23 GMT 2015
@MarkJLittlewood @andrewpercy @craigawoodhouse @richsimcox #labourdoorstep Sat Feb 07 20:27:51 GMT 2015
@andrewpercy @MarkJLittlewood @craigawoodhouse @richsimcox maybe they just don't know how to canvass? Aim nt most pledges but most accurate. Sat Feb 07 20:27:15 GMT 2015
@craigawoodhouse @MarkJLittlewood @richsimcox @andrewpercy more for amusement tho! In truth mps generally get a btr response thn candidates. Sat Feb 07 20:21:57 GMT 2015
@Spock_Thornaby @ChristineBell66 might be able to look into this? Sat Feb 07 13:57:53 GMT 2015
Good turnout in Stockton today. Lots of really positive discussions with residents. http://t.co/2o92VSKENe Sat Feb 07 12:52:58 GMT 2015
@jonathanmckie neither was I, if you read the thread he selectively quoted it was clearly response to sarcasm from the other tweeter. Fri Feb 06 19:09:26 GMT 2015
@jonathanmckie feel free to ignore him, hes not interested in issue just being annoying I'm afraid. Local labour activist I've had to block. Fri Feb 06 19:06:26 GMT 2015
Just walking down into Yarm for my surgery at the library.  Do pop in if you're passing! Here until 5pm Fri Feb 06 15:50:34 GMT 2015
Super meeting at @BaderPrimary with their "school parliament" I'm sat to the right hand side of the school PM! http://t.co/1v4bn2QwJc Fri Feb 06 15:19:31 GMT 2015
Brilliant questions from pupils at @es_6thform to @WilliamJHague impressive stuff from an impressive school. http://t.co/h0sLQKKMgh Fri Feb 06 13:26:33 GMT 2015
Great to see the new building coming on well at @TheGrangefield exciting times for a much loved school. http://t.co/GorjXtYjiu Fri Feb 06 12:00:38 GMT 2015
@jonathanmckie people weren't convinced that's for sure! I really do think they are having second thoughts now, hope so! Thu Feb 05 21:50:51 GMT 2015
@paulg1bson we won't let them get away with that :) Thu Feb 05 21:49:58 GMT 2015
@jonathanmckie it was a good meeting, I really think the Council is starting to get the message! Thu Feb 05 21:46:13 GMT 2015
@paulg1bson amazing wasn't it. Still at least people got to see what it can be like first hand!! Thu Feb 05 21:43:13 GMT 2015
@paulg1bson let's hope they get the message. I think they might! Thu Feb 05 21:24:30 GMT 2015
@BrisbaneLad @hartbrn that's very unprofessional, can you DM me name? Thu Feb 05 20:43:40 GMT 2015
Good turnout in Ingleby Barwick for consultation on proposed schools admissions changes. Thu Feb 05 17:39:46 GMT 2015
Strange, getting tweeted at by Labour people from Liverpool.  Wonder why they are interested in Stockton South...? Thu Feb 05 13:44:25 GMT 2015
Excellent meeting with Transport Sec who agreed significant funding for improving roads in Ingleby. @cook2_ came but didn't say a word... Wed Feb 04 15:59:16 GMT 2015
@Election_UK @LordAshcroft whether they eventually do or not there'll be serious tensions internally. Division weakening already weak Ed. Wed Feb 04 08:26:14 GMT 2015
@Election_UK @LordAshcroft this could have all sorts of impacts. Wed Feb 04 08:22:04 GMT 2015
@Election_UK @LordAshcroft spectacular stuff, though small swing back would save a few seats, limited resources going north? Wed Feb 04 08:20:57 GMT 2015
Quite a spectacular @LordAshcroft Scottish seats poll. We live in interesting times! Wed Feb 04 08:13:00 GMT 2015
@neilmccabe22 can you confirm whether IB Cllrs on select cmte opposed Egglescliffe admissions changes when discussed? Credit where due... Tue Feb 03 23:07:35 GMT 2015
@neilmccabe22 thought we'd discussed this? But if you want to have a go then so be it. Tue Feb 03 23:01:45 GMT 2015
What ISIS has done is almost indescribable. My thoughts are with that poor pilot's family. ISIS is an evil the likes of which we rarely see. Tue Feb 03 20:09:19 GMT 2015
@micklarkin hard to do justice to such a complex issue on Twitter though. Tue Feb 03 19:41:17 GMT 2015
@micklarkin because where 1 treatment is to egg other involves disposal/sacrifice of healthy embryo. 1st Id have voted for, 2nd I couldn't. Tue Feb 03 19:40:04 GMT 2015
I arrange for @stocktoncouncil to meet Transport Sec with me tomorrow. They press release abt it without mentioning me. Silly. #electionyear Tue Feb 03 18:58:35 GMT 2015
This great graphic shows just how well @TVU_LEP has done and how well Teesside is doing attracting govt. support. http://t.co/6kfTN8tWMW Tue Feb 03 14:37:39 GMT 2015
http://t.co/Ohkq1neUcL Hmm, @acunninghammp was on Sunday Politics talking about having been canvassing these tower blocks the other week... Tue Feb 03 09:39:55 GMT 2015
@thisisnotawar @stocktoncouncil indeed, brave for a Council.  Wonder who runs that twitter, btw, cya. Sun Feb 01 01:31:15 GMT 2015
@stocktoncouncil @thisisnotawar bravely political? Are you party partisan now? Oh dear... Sun Feb 01 01:25:32 GMT 2015
@mattbrown43 @JonathonTaylor1 sorry, what's the qu? Sun Feb 01 01:22:03 GMT 2015

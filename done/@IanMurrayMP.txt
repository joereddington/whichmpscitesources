@martinmccluskey @FrankieRTR the social justice mask slips from SNP as #indyref approaches #bedroomtax
Not 1 redistributive policy from SNP in 7 yrs in power, not 1 in white paper & now too busy with #indyref to turn up to #bedroomtax vote.
Apologies for cancelling Friday constituency diary commitments but we defeated the Govt on the #bedroomtax http://t.co/rmmTGFRTm3
GB "Salmond talks of social justice but has absolutely no redistributive policy. In fact his only economic policy is 3p tax cut 4 big biz".
Gordon Brown "1m jobs in Scotland are dependent on being part of the UK". This is the most positive case for UK. Strong single market.
Gordon Brown "Labour took 2m pensioners out of poverty with pension credit so don't let nationalist tell you otherwise."
Gordon Brown has asked Speaker to allow time for debate immediately after referendum to get timetable for implementing more devolution.

@lizzlevalente @EmilyB2902 @SaveCraighouse I don't disagree but LDP and planning process need fundamental reform.
@EmilyB2902 @SaveCraighouse @scotgov all labour Councillors spoke passionately against incl council leader. I understand vote was x party.
I'm genuinely shocked at #craighouse decision. @SaveCraighouse did a remarkable job. I said today planning is broken & @scotgov must fix.
@Motivationprobs @LizzyBuchan @edinburghpaper Andrew burns spoke passionately against the development.

“@UK_Together: Douglas: currency union would mean a foreign govt would set our budget & control our economy." < which is why UK not in €.
On the basis of Yes argument on EU and £ next time you get a parking ticket forget about the law and legal advice as pragmatism will kick in
I don't get the German re-unification argument on EU as that was a country coming together as a member not leaving an existing EU member.
How does a 3p corporation tax cut fit with greater fairness in Scotland?
@kdugdalemsp reminding people that SNP voted AGAINST putting living wage in govt contracts. They also redirected £1bn from poverty projects
UK is not in € because UK doesn't want EU currency union. Why would a £ currency union be any different? Arguments against € r same as £.
More misrepresentation from yes side. Alistair Darling said "you can use the £. The Ruble. The $. It's the central bank that's the issue."
I have a solution. If u want £, want EU, want a single market, want free movement & want mortgages to stay same u vote no. It's called UK.
Salmond said "the £ is a millstone around Scotland's neck" and wanted Euro, now he wants £ with 3 plan Bs. Total economic vandalism.
Sturgeon talks about a Wendy Alexander speech when she tried to predict oil price. Wendy got it wrong. Shows u can't predict volatile price

I remember when First Minister said Pound was a "millstone around Scotland's neck" when he wanted the Euro. All over the place on currency.
Real organisational problem with my diary this week. Where to schedule in my #IceBucketChallenge? Tomorrow 9am seems the option.
After another 90 minutes there was still no answers to the key real issues of currency or economy. That's too important to ignore.
North Sea oil is not a bonus but supports current expenditure. It's 50% of projected revenues.
Independent Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated a £6bn black hole in Scottish finances. That's a very large amount of money.
Oil revenues fell by £5bn last year. The entirety of education budget. How would that gap be closed?
Currency is not to be laughed about Mr Salmond it underpins my constituents jobs, mortgages and livelihoods.
Scottish Govt can help save Fergusons shipyard now as with Prestwick Airport under devolution.
The "Panama Plan" - using a currency without a central bank - is like driving a car without insurance. #bbcindyref
Everyone knows if you don't pay your debts you get a bad credit rating and then it costs you more if you can get it. #bbcindyref #nothanks
Salmond says he has 3 plan Bs but I've not heard 1yet. Maybe I missed them. I think 1 option was a bus.
@gorgienoise the wonders of a democratic society.
We got 18 years of Tory Govt in 1979 due to the SNP helping bring down the Labour Govt #snpfail

More PM lies to cover up his nonsense. Royal Mail made £400m last year. It was profitable in the public sector.
Only this out of touch PM could lose taxpayers £1bn by giving it to his mates in Royal Mail shares and call it a success.
.@Ed_Miliband right 2 highlight lack of transparency on Royal Mail shares sale. Who was on No.10 priority list who made hundreds of millions

40 minutes since I posted my blog piece and @wingsscotland still not confirming retraction.  He was quick enough to write it.
@WingsScotland Your entire story is about vandalism to the doors of my office.  That is not what happened.  Retract it as its not true.
@Trkielty I get up to 700 emails a day and will respond asap. It was only last Thursday and I always respond to constituent requests.
@wingsscotland will you now formally retract inaccuracies that were not checked? http://t.co/4ezO2CBgQ5
I have therefore produced a response & ppl can make their own mind up about accuracy of @WingsScotland blog. The bile on my feed says it all
He has chosen not to do so but merely to say he will correct any errors "of which there are none". According to @WingsScotland (2/3)
I took time out of my busy diary to give @WingsScotland a courtesy return call in order for him to retract his false blog last night. (1/3)
Tragic news coming from Liberton High School.  My thoughts go out to the family and all at the school. Dreadful news.
Another verdict from NAO #royalmail report "Several of priority investors have made a substantial profit by selling...shortly after the IPO"
Another quote from NAO report "we do not believe that the basis on which Royal Mail was sold recovered all of this value."
£750m lost to the taxpayer and the Govt claim #RoyalMail sale was a "success". No wonder Chancellor borrowing £190bn more than promised.
@UK_Together my constituency office was vandalised by Yes supporters last night. I can take personal abuse but it's getting out of control.
The NAO report on Royal Mail sale is so damning for Govt I wonder if Cable & Fallon thought it was an April Fool? http://t.co/9uZFZGX6jK
Press reporting National Audit Office scathing report on Govt Royal Mail sale.  Taxpayers lost millions. Wonder if Cable thinks it's froth?

Nothing frm Chancellor on energy, childcare, youth jobs, 0 hours contracts, or dealing with poor pay. Govt doesn't understand cost of living
If Chancellor does want to "help hardworking families" why make a tax cut for millionaires a priority? @MarrShow
If people are £1,600 a year worse off then the cost of living crisis needs to be a priority for budget. Govt has no plans for this crisis.
Chancellor says on @MarrShow "we don't build enough, make enough or export enough". For "we" read Tory Government don't.
We have a First Minister that refuses to deal in established facts and rather prefers the maybe instead. Simply not good enough. @MarrShow
Wonder if we will get Salmonds currency plan B on @MarrShow - I doubt it. SNP rejected Euro for same reason £ currency union doesn't work
The reintroduction of the 10p and 50p tax rates are pillars of fairness when people are struggling. SNP refuse to back this fairness.
@edballsmp rightly emphasises that all spending commitments to help with youth unemployment & cost of living crisis are fully funded.
Be interesting to see if Osborne announces extension of Help to Buy on @MarrShow given lowest house building since 1920s - creating bubble.
Cant fathom why SNP voted to exclude the Living Wage from SP procurement Bill today. Public contracts must lead by example 4 better pay.

Govt sale adviser on Royal Mail, Goldman Sachs, said company worth 330p but today they advise their clients to buy to 610p. Is this "froth"?
Not only have Ministers botched Royal Mail sale by undervaluing but the justification is now gone with 6 month results. More Qs to answer?
Astonishingly, Royal Mail said 1off windfall from pension reform boosted profits 2 £1.58bn. Privatisation justification was 2 raise capex!!!
RM profits up to £233m for 6 months 2 Sept, up from £94m last year. That profit now goes in dividends rather than to the public.
EDINBURGH SOUTH AND WESTMINSTER NEWS FROM @IANMURRAYMP - http://t.co/GQYYT9prMW
SNP manifestos in 07 & 11 promised 600 hours of childcare to all 3 & 4 year olds & haven't delivered it. They could deliver it tomorrow.
The EU is mentioned 719 times in the #indyref white paper but we don't know if we will be in EU or how long it will take. Lots riding on it.
The childcare policy in Indy White Paper can be delivered NOW as it is devolved to the Scottish Parliament.  More smoke and mirrors.
Over 600 pages of assumptions on currency, EU, debt, pensions etc. All these big assumptions will have to come off to keep things the same!

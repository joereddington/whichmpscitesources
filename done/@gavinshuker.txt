It's why we have a five year fixed term parliament. Instead they've no choice but to jump the gun; deficit still just shy of £100bn. (2/2)
It's worth remembering the original Tory plan. Four years of pain to zero the deficit then big pre-election tax cuts in the fifth. (1/2)

That is all. #F1.
4. You just sense another, final championship for @alo_oficial slipping away. So many wasted seasons at Ferrari, and no end in sight.
3. Ricciardo, Bottas, Kvyat: young racers getting a chance; proving they fully deserve their seats. Best year for young racers since 2007.
2. Which they did in Bahrain, giving us a fantastic race. So different to McLaren 98-99; Ferrari 2000-04, and welcome.
1. New F1 is immense, and @MercedesAMGF1 have wisely understood that their dominance will only be respected if they let their racers race.

Don't Let School Places Become a Political Football. New from me: http://t.co/XyzrzXOD3p via @HuffPostUKPol
Incredible piece on #FGM on @BBCNewsnight tonight. Why it didn't lead the show, I've no idea, @iankatz1000.
@rachwarwick @makelunch Yes! It had already crossed our minds, and we've not yet selected 2014 partner charities.
@lutoneye You had me at chic.
@lutoneye You should have said 'hi'.

@ForcesReviewUK I don't grant visas. You should contact the home office for clarification.
@ForcesReviewUK I'm not sure of the law in this area. EU nationals would definitely be fine.
Today we voted 219 - 1 to abandon the #badgercull. Govt will press on regardless. At very least they should have the balls to vote for it.
Farley by-election today to select a new local councillor. Vote Labour. Polls are open til 10pm. You do not need your polling card to vote.
.@ItsMitten Yeah, you do. Sorry kid.
Come work with us: http://t.co/Tt6e3vW9SQ
@markltn Sure. Which party?
I'm looking for a new Senior Parliamentary Assistant to join our Westminster team. Details here: http://t.co/Tt6e3vW9SQ
If you listen to one thing today, please make it @BBCWomansHour on Prostitution. Brutal, honest, eye-opening. http://t.co/SxYa2ZBAoE
Doorknocking in Farley this weekend: best reason for not voting Labour? 'I'm an investment backer; I like my bonuses!' Fair doos.

@EmmaBurnell_ Sure, love to.
@EmmaBurnell_ We both agree the law has to change. Would be good to continue debate when the APPG's report comes out in Feb.
@EmmaBurnell_ Actually the fact punters are not criminalised means the burden of criminality is on women. That's what needs to change.
@IainDale What a fantastically bad idea.
@andrewpearce10 I hear you. Isn't the question which party will increase yours?

@AdamSpokes I didn't, Adam. Parliamentary business (which obviously Jack didn't have to attend!).

@KamaalHussain3 Hi - been working with your police and crime commissioner @OllyMartins on this. Worth giving him a tweet.
Tonight, I cook dinner while my doctor housemate takes our blood pressures each in turn. One day I'll auction this off as an 'experience'.

@StayRC Best keep to @gavinshuker, Richard - far more stupid stuff about kittens there.
@StayRC Appreciate the feedback. TBH it's a feature not a bug; we think it'll always be for a much more specialist audience.
Let me praise the Tories and Lib Dems (and Ed Timpson in particular) for this on care leavers. Genuinely, well done. http://t.co/pCBw3KRaEp
@LutonEye Thanks.
I see the government are trumpeting their plans to build some things. We used to have a name for such activity. I think it was 'government'.
Coincidentally, to the best of my knowledge, she didn't know I was a politician. #mayonnaisegate

Caddington, Hyde and Slip End byelection today: vote Labour. You can vote until 10pm, and you do not need your polling card.
The Plain Packs U-U turn: govt were going to lose a vote on it in the Lords. (we were amending the education bill). They're buying time.
@timsykes3 Very welcome!
Well done: @uniofbeds has won a Queen's anniversary prize for research on child sexual exploitation (it's the bit where @lucieshuker works).

Really good night in Parliament. #imachristianontheleftbecause politics and justice are intertwined.
I covered Water for two years, and trust me, the idea the government has had any concern about rising bills before today is a massive joke.

@ThisWeekInBen Oh yeah, I was totally on the train. Not covered in jam, I admit. I made that bit up.
@ThisWeekInBen Sure, sure. Doesn't explain why I was covered in jam, though, now does it.
Given the storm, last night's anxiety dream involved not being able to find my train ticket when asked to by an inspector. Go figure.
@michaelstonnell I'm re-reading that story and asking where the split is. Genuinely.

@lutonexcelsior @ShukerOffice No.
@LutonEye Been in discussions with DfT in the past couple of weeks; there's progress but it's slow. Don't forget the money *was* in place.

@paulhammonducb Before my time, Paul.

Powerful articulation of why International Development still matters from @jimmurphymp. http://t.co/AwOZiIr8TG
@Yats44 Fantastic. Email responses are going to get a lot easier now!
That, and the fact Mr Status is setting up a free school, means you can safely assume their credibility is almost entirely exhausted.
I've now listened to the new Chase and Status on a loop for about nine days.
To clarify, I'm not.
Today, a mix-up about whether I was or was not @grantshapps (similar name, different haircut) nearly led to me abseiling.

Took the busway today. I was properly impressed. Passengers kept on coming up to me to tell how impressed they were too. Very speedy.

@ealingmumsinbiz @EalingNeighbour Sometimes not enough and they should because community groups deserve to be heard.
@EalingNeighbour @EalingCouncil @WECNF I totally agree but sometimes those running the council need opposition to point out their failings.

@rattlecans Explain?
@rattlecans What about the democratic will of the many Scots who are living south of the border and being denied a vote in the referendum?

@hashmo101 Yes and the fact that the whole region could become engulfed. The vote was not sanctioning action. It left that to a further vote
@hashmo101 Read my tweet carefully and you'll see I supported Govt motion precisely because it pledged a further vote before military action
@gjpaterson Why don't you read what I actually said and indeed the motion? There must be a further vote before military action. That is key.
@3XT1 You should actually read what I said and what the motion says. There will have to be another vote before military action. That is key.
On Syria, I will support Govt motion tonight but ONLY because it promises to await UN report & provides for another vote before mili action.

@jojomakepeace @Channel4 yes exactly the point I was making if you actually listened to what I said in its entirety.
@Zbigniew_G if you read my full remarks I'm suggesting Channel 4 does more proper progs on Islam rather than a gesture at 3am in the morning
@cyclemusketeers I am in touch with the Charity Commission to find out what is going on and what can be done to help these boys.

Just spoken in Home Affairs debate re new proposals on Dangerous Dogs & irresponsible owners.Ealing in top 10 of London boroughs w/problems.
Justice Sec agreed w/my qu on rehabilitation today - need2support small orgs who have2wait4payment by result which stretches their finances.
@HIWvintage That is a good question and I will endeavour to find out if I can.
@FloTom @ukip That sounds pretty totalitarian.
Voting UKIP today may make some feel better briefly but losing well-run Conservative councils would be a grim consequence to live with.
@mbarnbrook @geoggy11 Do fix a time to come and talk anytime.
@ytfcbadger These particular would-be immigrants served UK well & are in danger as a result. What does it say about us if we ignore this?
We should offer brave Afghan interpreters, who've supported our forces, a safe haven in UK and their families too. We owe it to them.
Watching BBC4's WW2 programme and struck by how similar Stafford Cripps looked2Tony and Hilary Benn. Is it the left-wing aristo connection?
@Geoggy11 @mbarnbrook The arrival of Crossrail will be the main game-changer and will hopefully allow more trains to stop at Turnham Green.

@jackav Plenty, including examples of overcrowded A&Es. Closing 4 closest2Ealing & Acton residents is reckless & will have knock on effects.
@jackav What wouldn't be sensible is to create unsustainable pressure on remaining A&Es by closing too many A&Es in one concentrated area.
We've collected nearly 300 postcards2go2Jeremy Hunt so far re A&E closures after handing them out @ yesterday's rally on #Ealing Common.
@mbarnbrook Yes, an important issue & both Mary McLeod MP & I have tried tackling TfL about it.We may have a better chance once Xrail comes.

Shame on my Labour-led council, #Ealing, for not lowering their flag like others (eg Hillingdon) to mark the passing of Baroness Thatcher.
@jidoely I think you will be able2see during inevitable legacy debate just how she rebuilt reputation of this country making tough choices.
@Spetmologer I applaud those who feel her policies were wrong but who've maintained respect on this day at least. Legacy debate will happen.
@Nigelgooing Yes there is a clear opinion divide but today is a day to be sensitive. There will be plenty of time to consider her legacy.
@AndyCSP Of course you and others will have your own views but surely on the day she actually dies is one for a sensitive tone?
@Nigelgooing On this day of all days it is surely important to adopt a sensitive tone. It is possible to do this without welcoming her death
@YohanesScarlett I understand that but there are ways and ways of reflecting divided opinion and it is an especially sensitive day today.
Can't understand why Nick Robinson report on BBC 6pm news needed to include someone celebrating Margaret Thatcher's death on this sad day.
So sad to hear of Margaret Thatcher's death. She was a towering figure and a brilliant Prime Minister who did great things for this country.
@Jotheringman5 @gemmawdmp Yes, S and P makes clear UK economy keeps triple A rating provided we stick to Govt. deficit reduction programme.
So sad to hear of the death of Charles Gallichan - Chairman of Ealing Community and Police Consultative Group. He will be sorely missed.

@cyclingalong Small world etc! I took along loads of LPs there over the years. Actually I still think vinyl is the best way to listen2music.
@barrywyman That is a good point. Someone else says female robins also have red breasts like males. Is that correct?
@cyclingalong That's really amazing, I did once own Abbey Road album - given to me by a cousin for my Birthday. Also looks like my writing.
@IwonaBoesche Maybe but even so it is, I think, pretty unusual!
@BigHowSparks I have many constituents asking4help 'cos they've large families in v cramped conditions.Meanwhile many properties underused.
Just seen 2 male robins at my mother's bird table feeding together. I thought they always fight so is this unusual?
Just told BBC London #Ealing Council showed poor judgement conflating need4more fosterers w/avoidance of impact of housing benefit reforms.
#Ealing Council irresponsible to mix up very important issue of foster care with housing benefit reform.

V enjoyable morning at Asda in Park Royal meeting constituents. Lots of issues discussed. Big thanks to Asda for their great hospitality.
@sophie_kside The aim is to free up bigger homes for larger families while those who need less space move into smaller homes.Makes sense2me.

Great to welcome HRH Duke of York to a very successful local youth centre - Westside at #Ealing today and hear his excellent speech.
@WhyShdWePayMore I think it entirely wrong to punish the many responsible drinkers with higher prices because of the sins of a minority.
Just asked the Home Sec if it is reasonable to ban all contact between police and journos - surely won't help to solve crimes or help public
Much more accurate and upbeat piece in today's Times 'Bricks and Mortar' supplement on life in Acton - well worth a read. #Acton
@PBSouthfield14 we will have to wait and see what the detail is, but I am keeping my fingers crossed.
Hearing positive movements re. Charing Cross A&E closure plans - fingers crossed. Ealing A&E next? #Ealing #Acton
I've Just spoken in chamber vs plans2close A&Es at #Ealing, Central Miiddx, Charing Cross & Hammersmith Hospitals. I hope Ministers listen.

@BillHicks123 @1party4all The top tax rate is in fact 45%. Making taxes too high makes us uncompetitive & drives high earners away
@BillHicks123 @1party4all Re-investing it in the NHS. The NHS budget is ring-fenced & all savings are reinvested to fund new NHS challenges.

Depressing platitudes from BBC Gen Director on Newsnight re Pollard Savile report.Nobody sacked and lots about improving leadership skills.
@NOincineratorNO I will let you know as soon as I get some responses although I doubt we will get much this side of the New Year.
@NOincineratorNO Met with TITRA rep this morning and have now written several letters to Council/Mayor/EnvironAgency expressing my concerns.
Pollard's Savile report lets BBC off lightly in my view.More about chaos than conspiracy.Not sure victims will be thrilled.

@kleephotography I haven't decided yet as I can see good arguments on both sides. It is a free vote so I'll listen to the debate carefully.
@salvey1 Well in this instance I think highly respected and very long standing religious institutions do deserve tolerance and respect.
@salvey1 If individual religious leaders feel unable to conduct gay marriages, their views should not only be tolerated but respected.

@iamhazlitt Yes there is but both are still legal.If you wish2outlaw tax avoidance you'd need2define exactly what would be acceptable4all.
@nicktemple1 Politicians must be aware of public's views of course but they also have views & I think they need2add those into the debate.
@iamhazlitt It's not straightforward.Anyone using an accountant is ensuring they pay no more tax than they have to by law.That is avoidance.
@iamhazlitt We need to be clear what we want to achieve with our laws. Right now technically tax avoidance but not tax evasion is legal.
@nicktemple1 I think this is an issue where there should be debate between many different views held by individual members of Parliament.
@iamhazlitt I think there are some areas where politicians should have a strong grip and others where they should back off.
@abigailb The answer is most of us don't but the board above us at least names the previous speaker until the next one starts!

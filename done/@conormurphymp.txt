DUP content to kick the issue of victims, the past etc into long grass but willing to bring the house down to do the Tories bidding on cuts.
Distinct lack of chatter on social media about today's developments at Stormont. Nobody taking @DUPleader seriously? #resignationfatigue
Great win for @shaneoneillsgfc tonight against Annaghmore in the qualifiers, 1-11 to 13 points. Young team dug deep to get the win.

@ColmDore Sindo will fulminate that I breathe!
@ColmDore Kind of. The physical comedy and performances of Cillian Murphy and Mikel Murphy were brilliant but it was like Becket on speed.
Went to see 'Ballyturk' in the Olympia, starring Stephen Rea and Cillian Murphy. One bottle of wine later..Still not sure what it was about!
Sad to hear of Paul Grimleys departure from @Armagh_GAA set up. He has built a good young squad and restored pride and confidence in county.
@PCIModerator @UlsterGAA Hope you were cheering for your neighbours in Armagh.
Great performance from @Armagh_GAA today. Pride restored and a lot of hope for the future.

Long and interesting day in London. Much as I like the place, I'm looking forward to home.

Took a walk today along the new pathway being developed between Omeath and Carlingford. Will be a great asset along the Lough when finished.
Disappointing for @Armagh_GAA  Hope we've enough points to stay up. Tough trip to Galway next.
@ElBurro66 Brilliant game. France restored their pride. Eire Abu!
What a performance! Heart stopping stuff!  France gave it their all but Ireland are CHAMPIONS #sixnations

@ElBurro66 You couldn't let the English win.  Surely!
Killeavy Castle, a hidden jewel on the slopes of Slieve Gullion. Optimistic about development plans  @mfearonsf http://t.co/T6TxjeggTG
Sadden to hear of death of Edward Haughey and others killed in helicopter crash, also to hear of passing of Tony Benn. Sympathy to families.
Attended the launch of COIN (Career Opportunities In Newry). Excellent cooperation between schools and employers. http://t.co/I7J8VNRKGq
BOD gets standing ovation in Waxy O'Connors in London too. Made 3 of Ireland's tries #legend
Good luck to @StJosephs1964 in their all-Ireland semi today. #Ardmhachaabu
@WeMcKe @jburns834 Saw that, though I was a pointless answer once myself.
@MurphCat67 @jburns834 Dont think so.
@jburns834 You're only looking to return it now?!  Remember the guy, didn't get a name.

Tommy Bowe on fire for @UlsterRugby tonight. 2 tries already. Good news for Ireland #sixnations
Assembly debate on OTRs was full of false indignation, half truths,straw men, red herrings and amateur dramatics. I really miss the place!
'Crisis' got @DUPleader a "Get out of Haass Free" card to the other side of the election. No wonder he's pleased, Brits probably happy too.
DUP leadership have now adopted the resign/crisis policies of the UUP as well. Plus ca change........
At Question Time in W'minster DUP MP's try to use Downey case to threaten Institutions, scupper Haass and block Finucane Inquiry.
Great morning for walk along the Thames. Meeting SOS later to talk about Haass, defending Peace Process and HGV levy.
Will be in London today and tomorrow for political engagements on Haass recommendations and HGV levy.
With @PaulMaskeyMP and his Belfast compadres at Killeavy Church during the Twin Peaks challenge. http://t.co/XcrKuvXfe7
Spanish State's reaction to positive developments in the Basque Peace Process is disgraceful. Genuine peace needs both sides engaged.
@ElBurro66 @MurphCat67 @ciaranjkearney @c1aranquinn @JarlathKearney Would love to say yes, unfair, but didn't really deserve it.
Twin Peaks Challenge tomorrow over Camlough Mt and Slieve Gullion. Hope to arrive in Ti Chulainn in time for Ireland v England #sixnations
@briancleland @newryarmaghsf @mfearonsf Sinn Fein has been consistent in arguing for the retention of this and all services at Daisy Hill.
@barraomuiri Was trying to look my best on the busy road. You could have painted my portrait on the back roads!
@DeborahKing1 Congrats.  Didn't know your new arrival had arrived. Hope all is well.
Beautiful day for the Bessbrook 10k Charity Run. Weather is looking good for next Saturdays Twin Peaks Challenge too. Spring on the way?
@mcshane_michael Looking in good shape lads. Wouldn't be doing much open water swimming here! Looking forward to @CrookedLakeTri
Going to Pairc Esler to cheer on Ulster champions @BallinderryGAC. Glad my old travelling partner @PocFada is back on the road with me.
@SarahJMcA @HarteValerie @DaireHughesSF South Armagh crew coming in to wow the Nyuks with our brainpower.......and we got Mickey's questions
Valentines night will be spent at a Sinn Fein election fundraiser for @HarteValerie in Newry.  Who said romance was dead.......?!!
@gildernewmp @MurphCat67 @NITransplants I'll thank you all to not be discussing my bits in public!
At info session on the Giro d'Italia bike race which will come through Armagh in May. Exciting opportunities ahead for community #GiroStart
@jburns834 @mcgeehanstephen You're probably right to expand your horizons. You're not having much luck with the GAA stuff.
@jburns834 Well, that was the most important one. Good match in Mullingar so far.
@jburns834 You should try that oul punditry. You'd be good at it!
@Eire_Libre Seem to remember the last time I went over Camlough Mountain, I was pushing Liam. Not what I'm looking for today, grma!
Comhgairdeas to @Eire_Libre. One of six women elected to Ard Comhairle at the Ard Fheis. Future is bright! #sfaf2014
Lazy Sunday morning at home after great #sfaf2014. Beautiful day in South Armagh. Would take the dog for a walk....if I had a dog.

@MurphCat67 @SportNINet @GerryKellyMLA @sportni Didn't want to show off! #poorexcuse
Opera House in Wexford is a great venue for the Ard Fheis. Sun coming out in sunny South East #sfaf14 http://t.co/lhu7uAKbpR

Congratulations to Rev Michael Barry on being appointed Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. Hugely popular and well respected in Newry.
@NiallSF Too many breaks for my liking. Worse than cricket.
@NiallSF Will be in Wexford at Ard Fheis with you unfortunately. It's on Setanta so we'll have to find a pub. Loser buys the drinks!
@ElBurro66 Good second half. Next week will be a tougher test.
Both @Armagh_GAA and @OfficialDownGAA draw their opening games. Should be an interesting clash on Friday night. #Ardmhachaabu
Good luck to @Armagh_GAA against @louthgaa today. Can't make it but will be following on twitter #Ardmhachaabu
@ElBurro66 @Jarlath_Kearney @blanz_ @ciaranjkearney @MurphCat67 The French have the luck of the Irish ! How come it never works for us?
Breakfast in @GroundedEBars reading @IrishTimes article on @MaryLouMcDonald. Bit patronising but ok, the article not the breakfast!
@MaeveMadden Will give u a shout the next Friday night I'm over in London. Stories from home will cure the loneliness.

Well rested from London trip. Now off to Cavan for Border Zone conference. Border Busters abu!
@uaiartza And always good to meet them a chara.
@RaymondMcCartn1 That's maybe why they're experts!
Full day of meetings with Lords, Ladies, Hon Members, diplomats, journalists and a Basque. Ready for home now and a decent nights sleep.
Watching House of Lords debate on parliamentary monitor. Earl of Listowel speaking. Is there something you need to tell us Martin Ferris?
In Westminster for a public briefing on Haass talks.  Seems there were more 'merry-go-round' talks in Stormont today. Leadership time.
@stpaulsintproj @stpaulsbbrook No problem. Thanks for the great food afterwards. Made up for the soaking. #goodcause
"At least it's dry" sez he. It was like cycling thru a car wash, and freezing too! Come back Michael Fish, all is forgiven. @stpaulsbbrook
Charity cycle around Slieve Gullion this morning for @stpaulsbbrook Windy but at least it's dry.
Meeting HMRC staff in Newry today to update them on our meeting with Treasury Minister and senior officials. Equality key to job protection.
Back in Leinster House this morning for more all Ireland work with my Oireachtas colleagues. Preparations for Ard Fheis #sfaf14
@Eire_Libre Travelling to Gulladuff isn't work, it's an adventure! #CuigeUladhAGM

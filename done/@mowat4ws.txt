2/2 @debloupots ...the site to its previous state. However, at least there is now light at the end of the tunnel! #arpley
1/2 @debloupots unfortunately it will be a while yet. Even without the appeal, they will still need to bring in materials to restore...
. @meninsheds Hi Steve, feel free to drop me some information. david.mowat.mp@parliament.uk
Who will @theyellows get in the 1st round of the #FAcup? Draw starting on BBC2 now #excited #PlayingWithTheBigBoys

. @Feebwab I appreciate that suffering still not at an end, but the light at the end of the tunnel is now much closer than it was 6 mths ago
. @Feebwab There will continue to be trucks as topsoil will have to be brought in in order to restore land to previous state
. @Feebwab Whoever hears fresh application will have to have regard to today's decision - so unlikely that new application would succeed.
@Feebwab There is still the possibility of Judicial Review, & another application pending, but today's decision will carry a lot of weight.

Delighted to welcome Theresa May to @peacecentre today to meet with @ColinParryPeace and the staff of the Foundation http://t.co/b7swm7zOfG
But there is still more to do, hence why I am running another #warringtonjobsfair see here https://t.co/W6QcdpqaGI #GettingBritainBackToWork
Pleased to report that #unemployment is down AGAIN in Warrington South. Down 130 on last month & 470 on last year #GettingBritainBackToWork
@PriestleyPol looking forward to it!

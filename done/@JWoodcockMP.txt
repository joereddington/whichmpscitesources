Why is govt making bill payers stump up extra ¬£400m for redrawn power line route that will disrupt Furness? 
Will be on @BBC_Cumbria shortly
After four years of govt scratching itself we back where we started on airports. This is why UK losing competitiveness to emerging nations.

@Graeme_Meikle @jimmurphymp agree, definitely needs to cool. And I know I'm not neutral but don't think is six of one half-a-dozen of other
@Graeme_Meikle @jimmurphymp .. organised but central Yes campaign can certainly play a role in stopping it. What's your view?
@Graeme_Meikle @jimmurphymp the video shows that local Yes campaigners organised on Facebook to shout him down. Dunno if centrally ...
@Graeme_Meikle @jimmurphymp understood, but it is more than an egg or a single crackpot - is organised abuse.

If we just turn up in HoC chamber there'd be no Speaker to keep order (or lights presumably) but it would at least be SOMETHING. #DIYrecall
Absurd govt reviewing terror laws but no recall. If PM too limp to face commons, can we just turn up in chamber & start debating? #DIYrecall
Threat from IS extremists revealed as more serious each day. Just not right parliament is vacated as govt prepares action - time for recall.
Not just USA - whole international community including UK MT @sowadally: Obama has to step this action up now. Unimaginable brutality

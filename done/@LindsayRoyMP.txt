Patriotic Scot rooting for win against Georgia.. Team Scotland - all the best
@widster @IndyReiver searching for that illusory freedom which we already have? The dream'
@MacEachainMor @widster yes - and standing up for Scots
@widster @MacEachainMor my loyalty is to the current and future generations of Scots
@widster @MacEachainMor check SNP expenses before criticising me - four figures  - hypocrisy
@MacEachainMor @widster patently not a bar bill!! Evidence conclusive, retract????
@MacEachainMor @widster resent all you like - is porky pie ing so second nature to you now that you cannot differentiate??
@MacEachainMor @widster fabrication - fly London City anyway - you should be bar red for telling lies. Is it your bill?
@MacEachainMor @widster free helicopter rides for all then?
@Froufrou42 @widster what a personal accolade
@Froufrou42 @widster Scots made their choice55%
@Froufrou42 @widster disowned?
@Daily_Record not the white paper again ?
@widster no expenses claims by MSPs - thought I noticed some - maybe just my imagination!
@widster I run on my own steam - doormat not stamped on my forehead!
@MacEachainMor @widster supported like your great leader - see Sunday post last year. Cap in hand now??
@widster you brought us thatcher - short memory
@widster and nobody else cares about Scotland - Nats have no monopoly - and the saltire is as much mine as yours
@widster not a fan of personality cult - but not maligning the great ( former) leader - he made a contribution!
@widster vow 55+ fantasy land 44-  - dream on - land of milk and honey = jam tomorrow??All right on the night based on back of postage stamp
@widster the news of L demise is distinctly premature - propaganda from tartan Tories
@widster coalition of the willing 55
@widster and who were you in bed with  - mainstream trots?
@widster pot and kettle comes to mind re outrageous yes behaviour albeit by a minority fringe -No campaign will deliver
Distinctly dodgy to base claims of prosperity on volatile oil price $ 88 now instead of $ 113
@widster obsession with separation - neglecting responsibilities - powers for a purpose??? Scots let down badly
@widster a prophet of doom - well placed to crystal ball gaze!!
@widster thanks for the premature farewell wishes
@rosschawkins @TimReidBBC aye right
@GovernorSarwar well said

@bmc875 @UKLabour 2/2 obsession with separation or deliberate ploy to exploit situation, when had the powers to act?? Powers with a purpose?
@bmc875 @UKLabour how many SNP did not turn up for last BTax vote? why with existing powers not nullify from day1. Obsession with separation
@Historywoman @BBCNews agreed - then and now !!!!!!!
@CallumFinlay life is full of contradictions
@BBCNews @Historywoman statesmanlike
@CallumFinlay retweeting is not endorsing
@MaciejDokurno @labourpress not promoting - making people aware - retweeting not endorsing!
@MaciejDokurno @labourpress @DavidCoburnUKip no I do not
@FifeMigrants @labourpress @DavidCoburnUKip retweeting is not agreeing or endorsing
@Montrave @CowdenbeathNews @CARFWeb congratulations
@MSmithsonPB irresponsible
@Allyhunter @Altany @scottishlabour @FifeLabour who tried to form local coalition with Tories after council election defeat??
@Allyhunter @Altany not same feedback we are getting @FifeLabour
@Allyhunter @C_Stihler_MEP I have a clear conscience too, committed to the many beneficial changes and the timetable to deliver @FifeLabour
@KhaleejiKat all the best - thanks for all your hard work
@GovernorSarwar great 'ambassador ' for social justice, ethnic and religious harmony and mutual respect
Well done John Swinney on statesmanlike comment on BBC Sc this am - commitment to working together and holding UK parties to account welcome
@Allyhunter @C_Stihler_MEP more scaremongering stories to explain result? all one sided -that will explain the outcome. NHS myths not count?
@RobAllan4 reconciliation alive and well then - democracy too!!!
@BaggingScotland @carlamccormack Edinburgh Scots equivalent to London - devolution must be accompanied by decentralisation of funds acrossUK
Attending service at St Giles today - we need to heal divisions - work together to achieve a better future/ beneficial change for all Scots
The First Minister, in generous manner, accepted result of the referendum vote and urged Scots to work together. We should all be doing that
@courier_fife how appropriate after 2011
@ShortyBhoy127 @thom_brooks playing ' project reality ' - who said there was anything wrong with immigrant?

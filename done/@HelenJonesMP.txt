#Budget 2014 – "You’re £1,600 worse off thanks to George Osborne and the Tories" says @edballsmp  http://t.co/75FYzkAJLx

Tax cut of £200,000 a year for a millionaire banker but govt says can't afford £200 a year pay increase for nurse says @Ed_Miliband
@Ed_Miliband says working people worse off under Tories. #Budget2014
Promising families £15 off their energy bills does nothing to offset the huge price rises. #Budget2014
Osborne so keen to name check Tory MPs he's forgotten both ends of new Mersey bridge in Labour Halton. #Budget2014
Osborne clearly doesn't realise that most emergency workers don't have enough to pay inheritance tax. #outoftouch #Budget2014
At last govt gives in to pressure to fund Survivors For Peace #Budget2014
More cuts promised but we can be sure they won't hit George's rich mates. #Budget2014
Many of Osborne's jobs are low paid, part-time or zero hours contracts. #Budget2014
Osborne ignoring fact that many people struggling with cost of living. Recovery only for few. #Budget2014
In #PMQs Good question from @iIanMurrayMP on why Cameron stops pay rises for NHS yet gives huge rises to Tory advisors.

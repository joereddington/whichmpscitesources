My response to fabricated email on blog site: http://t.co/zu2QI6aajV.  I wonder who is posting these lies? Thu Apr 23 12:14:01 BST 2015
Terrific morning at crazy hats walk with @VotePursglove http://t.co/xq8lmeUtYu Sun Mar 22 13:28:56 GMT 2015
Well done Wellingborough School for winning district final. http://t.co/2djezBj9wt Sat Mar 14 13:52:26 GMT 2015
...one: PM v Ed, two: Nige v Natalie, three: Nick v Nicola, Peter and Leanne. A fair and balanced approach. Thu Mar 05 10:43:55 GMT 2015
Election debates, one between major party leaders, one between the next two biggest party leaders, third debate minor leaders. That would be Thu Mar 05 10:39:55 GMT 2015
It is ridiculous to have the Leaders' Debates on April 30th, days after when 25% will have voted by post. PM right to want debate earlier. Thu Mar 05 10:36:47 GMT 2015
1/4 of voters will have voted by post before the TV head-to-head debate between DC & EM. The PM was right, debates should have been earlier. Mon Feb 23 13:08:27 GMT 2015
35 members of the Listening Team out in Swanspool today - excellent response on the doorstep! Thanks to all, including @adamsoffice! Sat Feb 21 19:05:49 GMT 2015
What were Channel 4 up to? This distortion of the truth does politics a disservice. I want to beat #UKIP fair and square, not by smears. Tue Feb 17 16:36:24 GMT 2015
Here's the letter! PM absolutely right - let's have the referendum asap! http://t.co/fbhMg6q7aq Wed Feb 11 23:02:03 GMT 2015
Seems to be some interest in letter from the PM about the North Northamptonshire EU Referendum, in which 81% voted to leave! Wed Feb 11 22:57:09 GMT 2015
@IsabelHardman maybe the question should be: an earlier referendum on the big question? Why 2017 and not next year? Mon Feb 02 16:09:02 GMT 2015
@reporterboy @IsabelHardman that is how Miliband will look come May 8th! #toryvictory Mon Feb 02 15:58:22 GMT 2015
The real Eurosceptics? Bruges Group rating 91%: me, 95%: Philip Hollobone, but only 77%: @DouglasCarswell & 79% @MarkReckless Why vote UKIP? Mon Feb 02 13:15:01 GMT 2015

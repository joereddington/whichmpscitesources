@PeterBoneMP
BBC seem to treat Eurosceptic Tory MPs with contempt. Still no apology from the BBC for wasting my time this morning. #privatisethebbc
Ladbrokes have David Cameron at 500-1 to be the next MP to defect to UKIP. That is a better bet than the 6-1 on me to defect!
Time for the Tories and UKIP to work together?
57% of the electorate in Rochester voted for centre-right parties. Labour polled 17%. Clearly Miliband has a problem. As for Clegg...
Just drove to BBC Northampton to be interviewed. Unfortunately they couldn't get their equipment to work or maybe it's just BBC censorship!!
Interesting visit  to Wellingborough fire station. Great to talk to green watch. Our firefighters are real heroes!! Thanks for the  toast.
Full surgery this morning, followed this afternoon by campaigning with the listening team.
Pleased Mrs Bone could represent me   in #Wellingborough too. She said the service was moving, especially with so many attending.
Huge turnout in #Rushden for #RemembranceSunday. Honoured to lay a wreath in memory of the fallen.
After my successful 'Tories For Nick' campaign, tonight, I'm launching 'Tories for Ed'. Hope it helps! #TFE
UK's net contribution in last Parliament was £19.5bn.  This Parliament, it will be £44bn.  So much for EU promises! #notworththepaper
Blair gave up the EU rebate in return for CAP reform. Effect on UK net contribution should have been nil???
Listening Team out in #Wellingborough and #CorbyEN with @VotePursglove and me today. Message to the EU loud and clear: EU GET STUFFED!
We should not pay the #EU 'Success Tax' - full stop.  Germans and French should be paying us for their failure.
Great lunch in #Rushden with @ZacGoldsmith. You can just about see Zac, @VotePursglove and I, at the back!! http://t.co/k9iQf9X3sY
Thanks to the 30 plus listening team out campaigning  in Wellingborough ,thousands  of  EU ballots delivered! Only Tories trust the people!!
Wonderful evening at the Wellingborough BAPS Swaminarayan Temple celebrating Diwali http://t.co/A9ZAgnPNfR
Ken Clarke is wrong to encourage Eurosceptic Tories to join UKIP. Does Ken really want the 'Better Off Out' Conservative MPs to join UKIP?
Just met with Prison Minister Andrew Selous MP with @VotePursglove to discuss the future of HMP Wellingborough http://t.co/krVmxUHnfw
Have meeting with the Prisons Minister next week. With work being carried out at Wellingborough HMP. Is the prison reopening? #listening
Enjoying canvassing with the Listening Team in North Northamptonshire! #listening
Understand that MoJ recruiting prison officers to serve at reopened #Wellingborough Prison - great news! Update meeting with Minister soon.
Now is the time for @David_Cameron to table the EU Referendum Bill in Gov't time and challenge #Labour and the #LibDems to support it!
Out delivering EU Ballots in North Northamptonshire with #ListeningTeam. Can vote to stay in, or come out, now at http://t.co/AqiinI3f6q!
It is now time for the centre-right to unite, not divide.  Cons and UKIP share many common goals.  Fighting will let the left in!
Out delivering EU Ballot leaflets with @VotePursglove. Only the #Conservatives can give us the chance to get out of the EU! #listening
Ladbrokes have me as favourite to defect to UKIP (EVENS) and to be next leader of the Conservative party (200 to 1) NEITHER ARE GOOD BETS!!!
Public spending per head East Midlands £8118, Scotland £10152, yet we pay the same taxes. What is fair in that? #scrapthebarnettformula
23 listening campaigners out in Queensway today . Great effort from everyone!
Now we must have English votes for English laws!!!
Thanks @VotePursglove, did the Ice Bucket Challenge for Crazy Hats breast cancer charity nominated Mr Junker and Mrs Bone!! @daily_politics
wind farms everywhere. The centre-right should be working together, not split.
the wind farm folly. Vote Conservative and you'll get all this. Vote UKIP and you get Labour, uncontrolled immigration, no referendum and
VERY disappointed to see DC's defection to UKIP. Both Tories and UKIP want an end to uncontrolled immigration, an EU referendum and ending
It is time to recall parliament ,unfortunately  MP,s cannot do this it can only be done by the government !
When EU renegotiation  blocked by European elite will Dave and Boris lead the out campaign ? What odds now UK being out of the EU by 2017?
Boris back, good news for Conservatives! Bad news for Labour! Turning point in general election campaign?
"@VotePursglove: Thoroughly enjoyed Sunday's game of cricket against the Northants Disability XI." < Hear, hear! Terrific game to play in!
With all the speculation a big name is leaving the Cabinet, you have to wonder: Is it Nick Clegg? That would be v. popular in the country!!
@BCCampaign an important cause, the fight against this awful disease continues #spreadtheword http://t.co/bcfAL6zO0h
HMP Wellingborough is now mothballed as reserve prison, Minister to meet with me to discuss the future http://t.co/PfV7fQFcLz

@nick_clegg - without his support @David_Cameron would not have been able to push through all our centre right reforms #toriesforclegg
Lord Heseltine 'Tory Pact with #UKIP would be mad' - thats convinced me its essential we reach an accord with our sister centre right party
Where is the #LibDem loyalty? Nick voted to cut immigration, cap benefits, reform the NHS & Free Schools. What's not to like? #Tories4Clegg
It is time all of us who think that Nick is leading the Lib Dems in the right direction, stand up to support him! #Tories4Clegg
In Corby and East Northants, Labour in 3rd place, nearly a thousand votes behind the Conservatives! Good news for @VotePursglove!

.@GilesDavies have you seen my typing?!
.@NTelegraph I've never known so much support for a development. Rushden Lakes will bring people into the area and boost local town centres!
@NTelegraph It's vital that all the legal issues are covered. The worst thing would be a judicial review. A few more weeks is worth waiting!
We are just getting the questions for #AskPeterBone in order and will be with you very shortly
Welcome to #AskPeterBone. There have been questions about The Times article. Here is a link to my statement on it. http://t.co/701Fvq5q6N
Sorry to hear about Tony Benn, said what he thought,new where he stood. Did not worry about whips!! A true man of conviction . R.I.P
EU Referendum: Miliband against, Clegg against, Farage for, Cameron for. But, only Cameron can deliver!
"@VotePursglove: Just to be clear: If the referendum were held tomorrow, based on the status quo, I'd vote to leave." Me too!!!
"@VotePursglove: Just to be clear: If the referendum were held tomorrow, based on the status quo, I'd vote to leave." Me too!!
DCLG to delay the decision on #RushdenLakes for a few weeks. Best to get the decision right, water-tight, and avoid any legal challenge.
Great weekend of campaigning with the joint listening team, both in Wellingborough and East Northants! Thanks to all that helped.
Attended excellent Wellingborough school civic service,Community cohesion volunteers outstanding!!!
Met with Graham Foster, Chairman, Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, useful and informative. Discussed KGH and the way forward

@andrewpolitics #CorbyEN, Andrew? @VotePursglove's odds have been halved in the last month... Or do you already have it down as a Tory gain?
@HuwSilkNT Not Chairman, but Treasurer. Tampa Bay Bucs - someone's gotta be... Two Wembley games this year. Great news!
Poor Ed Miliband - he could have agreed with the PM a motion over Syria. He could have been a statesman, but instead played party politics.
The PM listened to the views of Parliament and accepted that military action could not take place - well done David (a real Democrat!)
The PM took the issue of Syria's chemical weapons to Parliament to seek the view of MPs and the British people - unlike his predecessors!
MPs wrestled with what to do about Assad and use of nerve gas to kill women and children - decided that missile strikes weren't the answer.
There's no doubt that Parliament changed the policy of the executive.
Yesterday was a good day for Parliament, a good day for the PM, and a bad day for Miliband.
For my part I am talking to people in Wellingborough and listening to their views .I shall participate in  the debate . Then will I decide .
Parliament will speak tomorrow on Syria.This is no party political issue.MP's must do what they believe is right not what the whips say
Well done the prime minister  it was essential that parliament was recalled.Now I will be better informed before deciding  which way to vote
Went to Joan Chapman's funeral today ,she was a lovely lady.A friend to Jennie and I.  A great supporter of the Conservative Party R.I.P

Car the BBC have sent is now about to run out of petrol... Is this left-wing plot?!

Didn't spell my name right, letter wasn't signed and contained usual EU apologism. BBC are still institutionally biased in favour of the EU.

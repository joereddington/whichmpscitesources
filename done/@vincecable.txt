@tristanpc The most successful sustainable businesses I meet are those who take training and apprenticeships seriously. Fri Apr 17 13:56:34 BST 2015
The work I have led to deal with abuses in zero hour contracts and strengthening the minimum wage all help ensure the recovery is also fair. Fri Apr 17 09:37:58 BST 2015
The @LibDems in government promoted economic stability and a strong recovery. Wages now rising in real terms: living standards rising too. Fri Apr 17 09:36:22 BST 2015
After @LibDems investment in jobs & apprenticeships I welcome new employment figures: record number in work and youth unemployment down 150k Fri Apr 17 09:32:33 BST 2015
@VJ43 Hi, this report is worth a read: https://t.co/67QTldwbba Thu Apr 16 23:14:36 BST 2015
@mazoe Hi Zoe, very happy to be contacted to try to help. Please email me at: info@vincentcable.org.uk Thu Apr 16 21:08:05 BST 2015
@Hist_Teach Planning to be there on Saturday. Thu Apr 16 20:20:23 BST 2015
.@nusuk Many thanks for the questions and for organising this twitter debate. Read more in @LibDems manifesto here http://t.co/RMTySrMRO2 Thu Apr 16 14:14:39 BST 2015
@nusuk Planned investment in FE is at risk if Tories on their own cut too much. UK needs @LibDems in Government. Thu Apr 16 13:50:32 BST 2015
@nusuk My vision of FE “dual mandate” helping people into work, dealing with where school system has failed, is here: http://t.co/U0nNiDPMnw Thu Apr 16 13:49:49 BST 2015
@nusuk I am committed to maintaining the value of the Adult Skills budget. Thu Apr 16 13:49:16 BST 2015
@nusuk Our new careers and enterprise company will help with that, ensuring students know which FE options are most likely to lead to a job Thu Apr 16 13:44:48 BST 2015
@nusuk Schools need to take a lead here, ensuring they present vocational and academic options as having same standing and status. Thu Apr 16 13:44:30 BST 2015
@nusuk Yes @LibDems will protect education budget from cradle to college. We protected schools budget this Parliament will now do same to 19 Thu Apr 16 13:43:05 BST 2015
@nusuk More of the available FE funds are now going into #apprenticeships, and more than half of these go to adults over the age of 24. Thu Apr 16 13:39:38 BST 2015
@nusuk Adult community learning has been fully protected. The 24% figure is just one funding stream for FE Colleges. Thu Apr 16 13:39:07 BST 2015
@nusuk Our approach is to see more people #paidtolearnatrade with apprenticeships. Participants can earn much more than EMA would have given Thu Apr 16 13:36:07 BST 2015
@nusuk NAO has found our bursary support to 16-18s is more effective and better value than EMA. See page 9: http://t.co/qNrtbNkq1K Thu Apr 16 13:35:30 BST 2015
@nusuk Support must match students' needs so bursaries mustn't go to things students don't need or want. We'll review if this isn't working Thu Apr 16 13:33:50 BST 2015
@nusuk When Gove left DfE, we created a business-led careers and enterprise company to help schools give students access the info they need Thu Apr 16 13:22:27 BST 2015
@nusuk One of the problems we had in government was Michael Gove, who was against idea of careers advice and blocked progress. Thu Apr 16 13:22:08 BST 2015
@nusuk Proud @LibDems have delivered 2million more apprenticeships since 2010. Biggest expansion since the 1950s. #paidtolearnatrade Thu Apr 16 13:19:11 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems have delivered a massive rise in the apprentice minimum wage. Goes up 20% from October this year, and we want to go further Thu Apr 16 13:18:41 BST 2015
@nusuk Future changes should be driven by experts/professionals. An Education Standards Authority will stop politicians from designing exams Thu Apr 16 13:18:13 BST 2015
@nusuk Exam system needs some stability after many changes in last few years, teachers need freedom to adapt lessons to individual students Thu Apr 16 13:17:12 BST 2015
@nusuk Travel costs mustn't be a barrier to opportunity: @LibDems will cut bus fares for 16-21s 2/3rds with new Young Person’s Discount Card Thu Apr 16 13:16:22 BST 2015
@NatashaGlynne sorry to have missed you Natasha. Wed Apr 15 23:14:47 BST 2015

@gallina Thank-you - email me at info@vincentcable.org.uk. My team say that something a little less tightly cropped might be a good banner. Wed Apr 15 14:51:52 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems also vetoed the Communications Data Bill stopping Tory plans for government to access your emails and texts. Wed Apr 15 14:48:12 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems strongly opposed Tory demands and ensured the act contained specific protections for universities Wed Apr 15 14:47:31 BST 2015
@nusuk Need to protect education budgets from 2 to 19; ensure every teacher qualified; more role models in schools and better careers advice Wed Apr 15 14:47:01 BST 2015
@nusuk This is something we have to address in schools.It’s often too late by the time someone reaches university. Wed Apr 15 14:46:41 BST 2015
@nusuk Reducing fees would mean those grads earning £100,000s during their career pay less while those on ordinary incomes pay same as now Wed Apr 15 14:46:00 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems priority is ensuring any who gets the grades can go to Uni. More disadvantaged students going to university now than in 2010 Wed Apr 15 14:44:40 BST 2015
@nusuk OECD Director E&S says we are “one of the very few countries that's figured out a sustainable approach to higher education financing” Wed Apr 15 14:44:22 BST 2015
@nusuk Lib Dems will invest £8bn more per year by 2020 in NHS. We will look at best incentives to train new staff, including rise in bursary Wed Apr 15 14:42:59 BST 2015
@nusuk .@LibDems committed to retaining repayments made through the tax system, based on your annual income not on the amount borrowed. Wed Apr 15 14:42:04 BST 2015
@nusuk .@LibDems will not alter the terms and conditions for student loans, and we’ll keep income threshold for repayments index-linked. Wed Apr 15 14:41:49 BST 2015
@nusuk Many students like to have the whole sum upfront at the beginning of each term, to pay hall fees and manage their money termly. Wed Apr 15 14:41:30 BST 2015
@nusuk If these concerns are widely shared, we could look to consult on an option for monthly payments. Wed Apr 15 14:40:41 BST 2015
@nusuk We increased maintenance loans for those from lower income h-holds by nearly 12% in 2012 & match-funded universities to pay bursaries Wed Apr 15 14:40:16 BST 2015
@nusuk Rising rents reflect inflated housing market which is why @LibDems want to see 300,000 more homes built every year by 2020. Wed Apr 15 14:39:25 BST 2015
@nusuk Where genuine students are let down by a de-designated HEI, we always seek to get them into another institution to continue studies. Wed Apr 15 14:39:06 BST 2015
@nusuk We have taken a tougher approach with private Higher Education Institutions, introducing new penalties to deter malpractice. Wed Apr 15 14:38:50 BST 2015
@nusuk .@LibDems have also made 10,000 bursaries of £10,000 available for post-grad students.  See: http://t.co/0a0GUK042i Wed Apr 15 14:38:02 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems introduced for post-grad loans for under 30s, following @JulianHuppert’s strong campaigning on this. Wed Apr 15 14:37:19 BST 2015
@nusuk We will maintain DSA to ensure students with disabilities receive appropriate support, and review impact of any changes. Wed Apr 15 14:36:47 BST 2015
@nusuk @LibDems deferred changes to non-medical help for more consultation with Unis re their legal duty to make “reasonable adjustments” Wed Apr 15 14:36:17 BST 2015
@nusuk Universities & Govt must work together to make sure anyone with aspiration and ability can go into higher ed regardless of disability Wed Apr 15 14:35:47 BST 2015
Many thanks to @nusUK for their questions on Higher Education. I'll reply to each question now - follow them to see the debate. Wed Apr 15 14:33:48 BST 2015

@BritishGasHelp thanks I've lodged the complaint so I'll wait to hear
@BritishGasHelp hi - it was most definitely not resolved - bizarre to lodge a complaint & the first thing you're asked is 'will I close it'
Making a complaint to @BritishGas "would you like me to close that on our system or leave it open?" Say what now ?
Show your support for the 2014 Scottish Poppy Appeal. Add your @poppyscotland #Twibbon now http://t.co/fYq70R3Kef

https://t.co/2Kyu9g7ynx
@AngusMacNeilMP struggling to hear you again, where were you on Friday ?
.@AngusMacNeilMP no attempt to explain why you failed to vote against bedroom tax on Friday. Good job Scots can rely on @scottishlabour MPs
.@AngusMacNeilMP umm... where were you? (We can do this all night if you like)
@djknowles22 why thank you
.@AngusMacNeilMP I didn't quite catch your answer there - where were you instead of voting against bedroom tax on Friday?
.@AngusMacNeilMP its funnier than you not voting against the bedroom tax. Where were you ?
@willsouth70 thank you so much
@willsouth70 didn't count but was mobbed & all really fired up !
.@ThoKaGer great pics, good job

Very sorry to hear about Jim Dobbin. He told me on Friday he would be heading up to Scotland to campaign when he got back from Poland
@JohnRonaldHassa back to modern studies level 1 for you. The Government has a majority in parly. Good night
@JohnRonaldHassa @sallyshalam @AngusMacNeilMP you mean A YEAR after @scottishlabour called on SG to do it ?
@JohnRonaldHassa @sallyshalam @AngusMacNeilMP We defeated Govt no thanks to SNP MPs. Too busy with nationalism to vote against bedroom tax
@sallyshalam only 2 out of 6. Labour MPs out in force to defeat Govt... But no @AngusMacNeilMP
.@JohnRonaldHassa @AngusMacNeilMP @billybragg @scottishlabour voted against the bedroom tax on Friday unlike majority of SNP MPs
.@AngusMacNeilMP @billybragg did he vote Lib dem/Tory like Billy ? & was he pleased you couldn't be bothered to vote against #bedroomtax ?
@gordon_tony hi - my email best - it's info@gemmadoyle.org.uk
So that would be 3.5 years out of NATO. And that's from someone who thinks membership negotiations will not be problematic #nothanks
For the record - Colin Flemming said NATO negotiations cd take the length of the negotiations (18 months) plus possibly another 2 years 1/2
An incredible number of Yes tweeters think there's no Navy personnel in Scotland... There's over 3000 of them just down the road from me !
@ACunninghamMP cheers Alex
@chris_quinn92 I hear you, not long now x
@stevedocherty90 hello, yes I've actually bumped into your folks about 3 times in the last few weeks ! Campaign going well, not long now
@Alexx_McArthur @UKWorkTogether I hope the jobs will b saved. You know the other yards build MoD warships & Fergusons doesn't? That's the pt
I think #indyref has broken Facebook
@JackLamport @keithbrown @gavinesler erm, I think you got the wrong Keith Brown
Don't tell Austin Mitchell but I'll be back on telly talking about #defence tonight. Cause, that's what #labourwomen do @LabourWomensNet
.@Bigandyclark cheers ! Do come & see us in West Dunbartonshire
Anyone who thinks Indy = a more fair/left wing Scotland? Read the White Paper - cutting taxes for big business is SNP plan #nothanks
@AndrewShields74 yep - independence at any cost for them
@BenCooper86 hope you ok. Lots of tea & chocolate today x
And... The ITAR point is really important & could cost Scottish jobs #indyref  http://t.co/QmqA2VbTUZ
Deeply worrying for the security of Scots. If you are undecided this is definitely worth reading  #indyref http://t.co/QmqA2VbTUZ
@scotbot Anything else I should do because you tell me? Just so I've got the full list
@scotbot I condemn anyone assaulting anyone for any reason.
@holyroodmandy and both Jim & BT have a duty of care to staff & members of public who want to listen
@holyroodmandy did you watch Jim's video? Evidence clearly there. But back to original point - it's really not acceptable 1/2
@holyroodmandy indeed. I can guarantee egging people or coordinated abuse was not what he had in mind
Wow @iainmacwhirter thinks that politicians shd put up with being assaulted & is goading @jimmurphymp over incident https://t.co/Uuqc1svIFM
.@hldoyle big thanks to Ian Price @scottishlabour Gen Sec for joining us too
@AnneMcGuireMP yikes - I didn't know that was an option. Mostly very pleasant conversations however folk are voting
@hohoamzo Good on you Amy :)
Favourite door today from one of our team: "I'm Labour for independence." So you are normally a Labour supporter? "No"
Right...   #indyref
@nathan_mchardy oo good news ta
@TheScotsman swift action, thanks :)
.@TheScotsman your language is completely inappropriate & unnecessary. Who are you quoting ? &  'roly poly' ??
I think we might be done with the bus/currency analogies now no? #bbcindyref
.@JohannLamont right. Not one SNP policy has redistributed wealth in Scotland. Not believable that's why they want independence #bbcindyref
@melanie_ward I'm staging an intervention. You & I, drinks soon
Lovely personal piece from @Alison_McGovern on why the North West & Scotland should stick together http://t.co/ZXVJ5HmCJ4 #indyref #nothanks

@bessytweets less than 4 weeks x
On the doorsteps undecided voters ask about currency & pensions. Salmond didn't give the answers people looking for #bbcindyref #indyref
Our First Minister calls Scotland's largest single site employer a 'burden' Not a clue about importance of defence jobs to West of Scotland
My constituents can't wait 10 years for these mythical jobs Alex #bbcindyref
SNP might be taken seriously on defence if there was a single costed procurement pledge in White Paper #bbcindyref
Yet to meet anyone at the base who trusts Salmond with their jobs. Employers & trade unions agree  #bbcindyref
Salmond translation - 3 plan Bs = I don't have a clue on the currency, gonnae stop asking me ? #bbcindyref #indyref
@luxa_rosemburg said who ?  Will be a process not automatic
@aberdeen80 and a good evening to you too @DavidPBMaddox
@luxa_rosemburg that's an EU agreement. If we went Indy TTIP wd def hit Scottish NHS as it's UK going to get an exemption
@DavidPBMaddox It could only have been on the currency
"I'm not saying we can be forced to privatise the NHS in Scotland" says Salmond. A bit of honesty finally #bbcindyref
Is there a break? I haven't had my tea #bbcindyref
Alistair sums it up 'Stop playing games with us'. Salmond shd have spent less time on walking round the stage & more on currency answer
@michaeljmarra I'm sure that's a plan a, b & c
Since when was Salmond's wishes on currency on the ballot? Can't convince people this isn't vote 4 him if that's the arguement #bbcindyref
Here we go - Salmond bingo - pick whatever country suits your issue & say - why can't we be like Norway, Ireland, Iceland #bbcindyref
If Salmond can't convince voters on the currency tonight he can't win over the undecideds  #bbcindyref #indyref
Erm Salmond talking about all the good things Labour SG did - political choices not borders #bbcindyref
Ouch - @HumzaYousaf asked by Sky News presenter "are you happy with the blind leap of faith you are asking the Scottish people to take?

@ExRAFairman @labourpress @DailyMirror hello - do you want to email or send me a msg with your number?
@DavidK1975 I got a tiny half hearted apology printed weeks later. I had long conversations with them but I don't think they understood it
@DavidK1975 because they went with spin from nats about a bill which didn't cut anyone's benefits. Worst kind of politics
@steve_fi very sorry to hear that Steve
@OhAySee I really didn't - even Nats saying Salmond didn't do well enough
Game Set & Match to Alistair #ScotDecides
@DavidK1975 This is from they work for you - same as my colleagues http://t.co/RqMdMkdZKq
Hear that Scotland's young people? Salmond wants to make you stay here instead of exploring the world #ScotDecides That's his only plan
That's not Salmond using a Coalition Government Minister to back up his plans is it? In bed with the ConDem Government ?? #ScotDecides
Salmond has CUT 130,000 college places - free uni places & no college places #ScotDecides
@_katedevlin Dunbartonshire businessman
Dunbartonshire businessman John Corcoran in the audience very disappointed with lack of answers from Salmond #ScotDecides
@OmniPolitics I couldn't possibly endorse that ;)
NORWAY KLAXON
Commentator says Salmond wasted a time airing Yes campaign gripes. SNP put nationalism over the real issues Scots care about #ScotDecides
Is this really what Salmond decided to open with... ????
Nice one from Alistair - any 8 year old can tell you the flag & currency - What's the currency ? Salmond floundering badly #ScotDecides
The currency issue comes up time & again on the doorstep, if Salmond can't tell people what Plan B is he can't win over undecideds

@juandedumbarton only one person 'mouthing off'. Good night
@juandedumbarton a car crawling along dual carriage way is dangerous. & given that you didn't see it I think we'll leave it there
@juandedumbarton you are unhappy with me trying to a) keep WD roads safe & b) get tourist board to promote the area
@juandedumbarton @sojod33 in danger of causing a pile up of cars coming from behind
@juandedumbarton @sojod33 no problem with cyclists on the road. Issue was car crawling along behind blocking off a whole lane
@juandedumbarton @TeamWales not ok in fast moving, busy traffic on a dual carriage way - dangerous
@sojod33 @TeamWales that's polite not confrontational - it was dangerous for other road users in fast moving, busy traffic
@LochLomondside I'm guessing it was rammed
@atkieuk agree decision to retain or otherwise shd be on security basis. But economic impact for us obvs huge
Just spotted a @TeamWales cyclist on the A82 in Dumbarton being followed by a slow moving team car blocking a whole lane - please don't !
@Minion_McMinion it's not but easy to get to for visitors at the games

Hi @VisitScotland any chance you cd promote Scotland to the thousands of visitors @Glasgow2014 ? Loch Lomond, Dumbarton Castle, Titan Crane

@ayestotheright thank you !
Lovely to have @cathyjamieson in Clydebank for our floating fish & chip night. Rousing speech on @scottishlabour & @CoopParty values
3 Tories who shall rename nameless attempt to start a Mexican wave as @tomgreatrexmp says Ed Davey probably out of office in 11 months...
A lot of bombast & indignation from Ed Davey on energy prices... Not much help for people struggling to pay their bills @labourenergy
Why are the passport office sending out letters via 2nd class post to people who have days to sort out their passports ?! #shambles
@JosephRobinson_ not my claims - it is thousands
@JosephRobinson_ they have but 1) existing jobs wd go 2) replacement nos nowhere near as many as current 3) noises being made about Rosyth
@ron_dickinson Huge benefit to local economy & many locals working there
@JosephRobinson_ Hi Joseph - the workforce at the base is around half & half military & civilian.
Disgusted that the Scottish Government want to put thousands of workers in Scotland out their jobs #indyref #nothanks http://t.co/nKEEqhvmaW

Post campaigning ice cream. Not all for me http://t.co/QKMZWSE0Up
@MatthewDorrance indeed, it's gorgeous - enjoy !
@MatthewDorrance you're a bit short of doorsteps there
@jimmurphymp you're very welcome
@THDefence I think that's the kind response !
@johnringer ah good point. I was in carb heaven choosing between pizza & pasta so a little distracted. Think it was mom

@60llum no choice except a zero hours contract if they want to work. & Job centre sanctioning people for not taking a zero hours contract
@60llum Anne made point it is the misuse that is real problem, 80% of workforce in some companies on them. And lots of people have no choice
@LochLomondside @KennyFarq eeek !
A tour de force from @AnneMcGuireMP on zero hours contracts. Took out a Tory or two with her sharp tongue as she went
@KennyFarq have yet to see a man wearing one who doesn't look like he's been dragged through a hedge backwards. Terrible invention
.@AnneMcGuireMP making her last Queens Speech contribution. Says this one not nearly as exciting as first one she heard as an MP in 1997
@KennyFarq oh don't encourage them

@Alexx_McArthur well she's there as a normal person to speak up for carers but know she will appreciate your kind words about her work
Attacks on Clare Lally and others from Monday's launch disgraceful. They are human beings, try to remember that #indyref

@GwynneMP cake looks yum though !
@GwynneMP I think you might have tagged the wrong Claire there. Just a hunch
Absolutely in awe of our D Day Veterans. Their stories are incredible. We owe them so much
@stuIz75 very happy to engage any time if you are brave enough to come out from behind the anonymity. Feel free to contact me
@stuIz75 you are badly misinformed. Cheerio
@stuIz75 yes having proper conversations with people & listening to them. Clearly I am a terrible MP
@AngusMacNeilMP think we need to know the future for all comfort food depending on yes /no
@livvyjohn @AnasSarwar Oh it was definitely meant for him
@stuIz75 a) calm down - it's a lighthearted comment b) I am out every week talking & debating with people on the doorsteps & in the street
@livvyjohn What is it they say about men with flash cars ?? #indyrefexpress
@AngusMacNeilMP nothing compared to your ice cream scaremongering
We have just had a discussion about ice cream in #indyref context in the chamber #surreal #rollonSept19

Thank goodness for @scottishlabour - wouldn't have any Scottish women MEPs otherwise. Well done @davidmartinmep & @C_Stihler_MEP !
Finding the reading out of MEP's home addresses a bit odd
@DarrenClifford2 ah - I see what you did there !!
@DarrenClifford2 Scotland results are deliberately not til tomorrow in comparison with the hold up in London
@burdzeyeview absolutely wd rather see another Labour MEP than a UKIP 1. If you won't correct misleading tweets then G'night from me !
@burdzeyeview yep & you put folk after it as opposed to your labour tweet. & I see few if any centre left policies from the SNP
@burdzeyeview exactly. SNP 'folk' versus @scottishlabour Two different things. One could be anyone - the other head office
@burdzeyeview think you should probably read that back to work out who it best describes !!
@burdzeyeview not seeing that & we're not going to agree but no such comments made by @scottishlabour & it's not on to imply otherwise
Second interview today I've watched Tim Farron saying "I've lost myself previously" Bit careless no?
@burdzeyeview you are attributing an opinion/comments to a specific account. No such comments made by that account. Not on !
@burdzeyeview sorry that's just not true - pretty clear there's absolutely no-one tweeting from that account tonight...

@AnnieslandSNP nowt but bluff & bluster to cover ur leader's comments which have embarrassed Scotland. U do know he supports a welfare cap?
@AnnieslandSNP I did & do actually. Seemed like you were questioning my nationality. Hopefully not
@AnnieslandSNP why "Scottish" ? @JohnRobertsonMP
Fancy working with some of the best young people in the UK? Check out @mjs_wdn who are advertising 3 head teacher jobs inc at my old Primary
@WynnScottishSun his words not mine
@GregorAddison1 see previous tweet
@WynnScottishSun mabye check my previous tweet....
@WynnScottishSun I criticised him at the time. Fact that senior journalist referred to SNP as 'Putin's allies' is significant
Salmond must apologise for his damaging comments re Putin - he does not speak for vast majority of Scots on this
.@MichaelWhite asks q at Press Gallery referring to Putin & his allies in Scotland's nationalist parties. Awful this now how Scotland seen..
.@simonevans117 @LabourStudents aww thanks - nice to be asked x

@ericjoyce it's not about our relationship with Russia...
@ericjoyce Eh? It's illustrating why Salmond is wrong. No mention of anything UK shd do
Salmond should say if he stands by his reprehensible comments on Putin & if not, apologise. http://t.co/losuwSl9wE
@CraigICameron GQ magazine
.@paulhutcheon or gay Scots, or any Scots who care about human rights for that matter
Salmond's comments on Putin appalling. You don't restore national pride by annexing parts of other countries or by scrapping human rights

.@CllrWhitehouse I asked 2 questions, they are my words, certainly didn't attribute them to you!
.@CllrWhitehouse do you think merit is the reason there are none? Do you think women are less able to decide monetary policy than men?
.@CllrWhitehouse me too which is why I reckon there should be some women on the MPC
@JemmaMcGuffie Hi, HEFE already devolved 2 SP. Cd not charge Eng students diff fees if independent & in EU. Wd put more pressure on Scots
.@CllrWhitehouse Do you think there are no women who do merit a place on MPC or do you think it might be another reason? #IWD2014

@SeemaMalhotra1
Proud to vote for @CliveEfford's Bill to #SaveOurNHS today. Great to have residents from #Feltham&Heston in the gallery supporting the Bill.
Really good piece on@BBCNews this morning on domestic abuse and refuges under threat. Important to grow public understanding of the issue.
Just spoken on Radio Oxford - important story this morning about women & children unable to leave refuges as no affordable home to go to
.@YvetteCooperMP opens the debate on the European Arrest Warrant - Labour's motion is clear and includes all 35 measures
Hoping it's true that pick up artist Julien Blanc to be barred from the UK - brilliant tribute to all those who have campaigned against him
Brilliant speech by Gareth Thomas introducing his NHS and Care Workers Credit Union 10 Minute Rule Bill
Horrified by Jerusalem synagogue attack. Really important there isn't a disproportionate response. Politics must be the answer, not weapons.
About to join @therealNihal on @bbcasiannetwork
800,000 offences left off official crime stats. Police officers fail to record 25% sexual offences. 37 rapes not classified as crimes. #HMIC

Just asked Home Sec to consider using powers to exclude Julien Blanc if she assesses his presence not conducive 2 public good << no answer
Home office Questions beginning now...
And in the Guardian << "Labour's @yvettcoopermp calls on Theresa May to block Julien Blanc visit to UK" http://t.co/p2jRnyihuP @LBC
...parents are calling for it to help their kids have the understanding and tools to make informed choices, and pupils want SRE too @LBC
Was hoping Nick Gibb might say the Govt had seen the light and was going to back compulsory sex & relationship education in schools @LBC
Any views about Julien Blanc? Call Stig and Petrie on @lbc on 0345 6060973 or text 84850. Debating the issue till 11am.
Just on @LBC arguing that Julien Blanc shouldn't come to the UK. Instead of his views, we need to promote zero tolerance of gender violence

@damianjread pls email me - we have ongoing survey and campaign on local and national NHS services
Yvette's proposal is now being debated, with Tories allegedly filibustering to give time for MPs to come back to the House who were slipped
Incase confused,Yvette has moved that effectively we come back tomorrow to debate and vote on all 35 measures 2 put vote beyond legal doubt
Absolutely incredible state of affairs. In one way perhaps the best debate I have ever attended.
The chaos continues. Theresa May now speaking to the motion that the question be not now put. Jacob Rees-Mogg raises point of order.
@nitabhalla @RockingAWomen what's the name of the report and date published? Thanks!
@IsabelHardman it was confusing us I have to say.
@IsabelHardman true!
@HillierRobert there is a vote at 10pm but only on 10 regulations that need to be transposed into UK legislation - so not a vote on the #EAW
@IsabelHardman they aren't points of order! They are speeches in the debate on the Business Motion! Home Sec could intervene but hasn't yet.
So who was behind this - Gove or May?
Unprecedented calls by senior MPs for the Govt to withdraw its motion today. Theresa May's reputation has taken a serious knock.
The plot thickens RT @IsabelHardman: Gove and May appear to have agreed something. He gets up and walks towards speaker's chair
Absolutely bizarre situation in the Chamber with total confusion abt whether there is a debate & vote on the European Arrest Warrant or not
@RockingAWomen @nitabhalla can you send a link to the UN Report?
Brilliant to hear @Ed_Miliband mention importance of work experience at schools #CBI
@Ed_Miliband addressing CBI Conference - telling it as it is for those left behind and thanking our businesses for what they do for Britain
What did even more people say to me today? This country needs a change of Govt & Labour needs to stay united. U know what? I agree. #ed4pm

@howarthm nor can we hide behind any reason- ethnicity or any other, for not dealing with the crime itself &bringing perpetrators to justice
@howarthm it needs a step change in our response, and in public attitudes. Individual inquiries are clearly not enough - it needs much more
@howarthm ..the report also lays out the history of CSE in other places Staffordshire, Oxford, Oldham, Telford, Reading, Blackpool etc....
@howarthm that absolutely has to change. I back the calls for mandatory reporting. The scale of the abuse in Rotherham continues to shock..
@howarthm social services, council, police failed in basic responsibilities. @SarahChampionMP spot on - the children weren't seen as victims
@howarthm @SarahChampionMP the report continues to shock with the depth of how children, mostly girls, were left to live out a nightmare

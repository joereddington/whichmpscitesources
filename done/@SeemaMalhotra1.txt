Very telling that Osborne has just refused several times to rule out a 
coalition with UKIP on newsnight #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 23:02:48 BST 2015
Tonight @Ed_Miliband set out a clear choice and a clear plan - Cameron just faded into the background #invisibleman #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:35:39 BST 2015
Why vote Labour? Make work pay. And get fair pay. Labour will raise the minimum wage to £8 and ban exploitative zero hr contracts. Thu Apr 02 21:56:23 BST 2015

other and they're both right." #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:41:30 BST 2015

Labour will ban exploitative zero hours contracts & make work pay again.Cameron surprisingly flippant & blunders on zero hrs. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:27:16 BST 2015
Cameron totally out of this debate on immigration. #invisibleman #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:22:59 BST 2015
David Cameron talks tough on immigration. But there are fewer stopped at the border and fewer criminals deported. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:18:18 BST 2015
What he can deliver? Really? Cameron broke his promise on net migration. Labour will put controls on immigration. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:12:22 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband has landed serious attacks on DC record. Cameron is 
silent on his record on the #NHS. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:00:42 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband tells is as it is "The NHS is creaking ..imagine what it  will be like after another five years of the Tories" #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:55:37 BST 2015
Pretty revealing that Cameron hasn't pushed back on @Ed_Miliband's challenge of broken promises on the #NHS. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:50:27 BST 2015

Why DC won’t debate: the Tories are borrowing over £200bn more than planned in 2010 #runningscared #battleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:47:13 GMT 2015
Remind me what happened to Remploy factories under the Tories? Somehow they didn't get a mention in Cameron's answer. #runningscared Thu Mar 26 21:36:45 GMT 2015
Cameron coming across as out of touch on zero hours contracts & is having to come clean on broken promises - no wonder he is #runningscared Thu Mar 26 21:30:25 GMT 2015
Oh Cameron. What nonsense. You said one thing and did another. We were coming out of recession in May 2010, and you know it. Thu Mar 26 21:13:47 GMT 2015
Paxman focuses on chasm between "what Cameron said and what he did" - Cameron accepts he hasn't met the commitment he made on immigration Thu Mar 26 21:11:43 GMT 2015
One reason why DC won’t debate: he doesn't want to be challenged about why under him family bills are up over £300 since 2010 #runningscared Thu Mar 26 21:09:47 GMT 2015
Paxman grills Cameron on his poor judgement - maybe he'll start to wish he hadn't agreed to tonight's debate either Thu Mar 26 21:07:43 GMT 2015

@wiiaholic  If you are a constituent please email me and I will explain why the #NHS bill today is not needed and why I don't support it
I suppose 51% isn't bad turnout in by-election but I still worry the real winner last night was, yet again,  None Of The Above #disillusion
I am very sorry that so many decent people have been  deceived by Thirty Eight Degrees into imagining free trade with USA threatens the NHS
@polarben Great presentation at @YourLifeTeam launch - thank you! Really helps the maths/physics cause
@DeloitteUK Would really help debate if you also identified spend on international development
@lorealparisuk claim 73% of 50 men agree with their claims for a face gel; just who was the thirty-six-and-a-halfth man, I wonder?
@SE25A  Disarray on Europe has been our problem for decades!
@cuerSolarTeam @QEPrize Oh yes there can! We need to do less better, with more impact
@English_Woman Hmm, not sure that's entirely fair, but we do need a more diverse engineering workforce
@SE25A No I don't - but I do give priority to my constituents and to the courteous
Maths and physics crucial tools for young people who want to change the world says polar explorer Ben Saunders at #YourLife  campaign launch
Rachel Riley, Countdown presenter, at #YourLife launch, says it's the bankers who dominate recruiting of STEM graduates from Oxbridge
@rhys_raeng @Science_Grrl The @YourLifeTeam campaign will only work of it retains a laser focus on A level maths and physics uptake
#yourlife campaign must be careful not to,duplicate existing STEM inspiration activity; we already have Oscar,for engineering - @QEPrize
@SE25A But on Twitter you have to talk in sound bites!
Success at sciences big driver of social mobility says @NickyMorgan01 at launch of #yourlife campaign at Google Town Hall

@SkyBrex @HBaldwinMP But at what cost to south Worcestershire?
@Michael_Heaver I never have! UK membership of a reformed EU will bring real benefits to our security, our society and our economy
@Michael_Heaver So UKIP puts narrow ideology ahead of public safety and justice - great!
@declamare @jameskirkup I agree: but quietly and calmly telling the truth is - and the trth is that EU migration brings economic benefits
#TowerPoppies seen by a full moon tonight were more impressive even than I expected; and silence of crowd too http://t.co/yh0b3SmmIr
Brave of Ed Miliband at #PMQs to allege Conservatives divided; Labour is, of course, united - in despair at Miliband's weakness
@geoffmer @UKDefSecAdvisor What on earth is your logic? We need all the help we can to recover from the biggest recession in living memory!
@theboybutler @RidleyWasRight @jameskirkup A large proportion of EU immigrants are highly skilled and provide vital support, eg, for the NHS
I recognise that EU immigration can pose challenges for communities, but it brings real economic benefits   
http://t.co/kpHbsu9Cbm

@AlanGAnderson You can now read the minister's statement on Thursday at http://t.co/6bFxyVNClI - feel free to email me with your reaction
@AlanGAnderson @BBCPolitics I share your concern - there is a question in the House today - let's see what's said.
@ZacGoldsmith @A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber That's not true, Zac; just 5% could have triggered the process
@declamare @A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber @ZacGoldsmith What makes you say that? I studied all the amendments and Zac's really worried me
@A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber @ZacGoldsmith No - the risk of recall for disagreeing with a vocal minority is profoundly undemocratic
@A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber @ZacGoldsmith No
Ref EU £1.7 bill - UK does more for common EU security than any other member state through its national defence and development spending
@MarinaKim_ No they can't - there are rules to prevent that; but recall risks national pressure groups targeting MPs they disagree with
@ExCllrPete Actually I'm interested in protecting democracy and the rights of the silent majority against the vocal minority
@A_Liberty_Rebel @R_de_Gerber @ZacGoldsmith I value my constituents, not single issue pressure groups who would have been real beneficiaries
@MarinaKim_ 166 of my colleagues sadly didn't see the danger of handing politics over to small, well funded, single issue pressure groups
@English_Woman Happy you should do so - I'm not standing again and my vote was principle, not self-interest
@Lee_Lomas No, poor opinion of well funded, unrepresentative, single issue pressure groups who would easily get 5% to start recall process
Looking like a big majority against Zac Goldsmith's dangerous proposal to amend government bill on recall of MPs
@Saab Congratulations on Brazil #Gripen contract; great news for UK defence sector with large UK content in every aircraft
Glad PM begins Commons statement with Afghanistan, Ebola, climate change and Ukraine, reminding us UK's international influence so important

@Rosiejanele I am very sorry for your loss and respect your political views but I honestly believe your diagnosis for the NHS is wrong
Important message for my Party; Ipsos MORI shows support for EU membership highest for 23 years even as UKIP rises  https://t.co/g58bgD9XAn
@Rosiejanele The NHS will remain free at the point of delivery and its budget's increasing; there is no threat of the kind you describe
@GuidoFawkes Splendid! But I do worry is that the pen is mightier than the sword....

Another important piece from @MatthewParris3 in @thetimes ;politicians mustn't  patonise voters when they're wrong but tell them so
@thetimes bizarrely leads on pressure for Tory/UKIP pact, a really silly idea; for every vote won from right it would lose two from centre
@svallance1 Sorry but this is a county council issue & you must ask your county councillor, but there was extensive consultation
Just a bit sad that Nick Clegg talks angrily of the tribalism of UK politics in a tribal speech ignoring One Nation Conservative tradition
@grumble000 What?!
Really good socially compassionate, economically liberal, mainstream Conservative speech from David Cameron at Birmingham Party Conference
@revdavesouthall @WorcCathedral A real pleasure to be part of such a happy occasion - thank you for all you did
@TimMontgomerie just like Carswell and Reckless posed as Tories in 2010?
Right @Conservatives response to Carswell aand Reckless? Make it 100% clear that UKIP is wrong and membership of reformed EU is vital for UK
@WorcsAcuteNHS A real pleasure to be part of such a welcome celebration of care and commitment in our local NHS
@LukeRyder23 @NoChickenFarm intensive industrial scale chicken farming does not belong in such concentration as planned in Upton Snodsbury
I've called for action to support Upton Snodsbury @NoChickenFarm campaign http://t.co/UViz9pCGv5
@sammacrory  Not shouted down; criticised for making a very obvious point that we all agree with!
@111rattie I never ignore a constituent, whether I agree or disagree with them
@Number10gov PM right to emphasise unique nature of a number of UK defence capabilities that would be used in any action against ISIL
Genuinely sorry to hear that Robin Southwell is standing down from his leadership of @Airbus in UK; a doughty champion of whole sector
@NoChickenFarm  A pleasure to attend such a constructive meeting; we must do all we can to stop them!
Big thank you to @DaveThroupEA and the whole EA team for handling difficult but important questions @Notochickenfarm meeting so well
Can't say I'm surprised Ed "forgot" to mention the deficit - sadly it was the only real "achievement" of the last government, as he knows
Off soon to important @NoToChickenFarm public meeting with Environment Agency at 7.30 in Upton Snodsbury Church
@BarbBayton Ah, but I don't understand precisely what "Bob" wants so I haven't signed up formally; his ambitions seem noble but vague!
@hayley0960 @rspb Although I don't understand exactly what Bob's manifesto is, I'm a supporter in principle
@BarbBayton As a member of the Worcestershire Wildlife Trust I'm already committed to the cause!
Almost half of all Syrians have been forced to flee their homes; the regional humanitarian operation now largest in UNHCR's 64-yr history
Depressing to hear someone as thoughtful as Tristram Hunt being so narrowly partisan & reluctant  on English devolution on BBC Radio 4
@AlbionVoice @paulgriffithsLD @tomedwardsWN Agreed; that's why I want the views of local people in Worcestershire on how to govern our area
@paulgriffithsLD @tomedwardsWN Agreed; but as City Regions are advocated by all three major Parties,  my concern is the good of our county
@svallance1 Yes thank you; I will reply soon
@Higgij @NavyLookout @Robfm @u_dakka Absolutley right - and the increasing cost and complexity of technology is another factor
Warning to Worcestershire; fight the emerging idea of City Regions which would mean our county being controlled by Birmingham
@NavyLookout @Robfm @u_dakka Total nonsense! I am responsible for the new Single Source Regulations Offiice which deals with this problem
@NavyLookout The real lack of strategic wisdom is having such a small navy and you can't sustain shipbuilding skills without building ships.
@NavyLookout No! All about having sufficient skills to build high quality ships to time and budget and that means one yard
@NavyLookout @mcjwalsh Even if we built twice the number of ships (which would be very sensible) I doubt we could sustain two yards
@svallance1 peter.luff.mp@parliament.uk
@AlanGAnderson Robust but positive scrutiny defines the need perfectly
@svallance1 Everyone's situation is different and personal; I would be delighted to hear more about yours via email
A long period of silence from those anonymous Tory MPs who were so anxious to destabilise the Prime Minister would now be very welcome
@svallance1  Sadly you're right, but at least we won't all be hopelessly distracted sorting out the break-up of the UK
@clooky Yes! In fact I first made that suggestion many years ago
Now Scotland has made welcome decision to stay in UK family I look forward to hearing from my constituents what deal they seek for England
Genuinely delighted for Scotland; apart from anything else it means Scottish yards CAN build the next UK frigates, the Type 26
@SizzleBang No.  A single currency only works in a single country; otherwise the risks for my Worcestershire constituents would be huge
The referendum debate has brought home to many English people like me just how deep is our affection for the Scots; please say "NO"!
@svallance1 I agree 100 per cent
@SizzleBang I never ignore constituents but I didn't understand your point; could you email me with a longer explanation of your worries?
One good thing to come out of this referendum is the proof that the English really value the Scottish contribution to UK #wakeuptobreakup
@svallance1 @tomedwardsWN @worcscc Yes those "wicked" Tories keep taxes down and improve public services - I see why you hate us so!
I've signed the let's stay together campaign @wakeuptobreakup: our friends in Scotland need to know we really want them to stay

@FASD_Trust Thank you for coming to Westminster to talk about the Trust's important work and message
@FASD_Trust Thank you for coming to Westminster to explain your important work
@75_steph Agreed, but friends should still feel free to tell friends what they think, surely?
Ten days to save the Union; if you have friends or family in Scotland, please tell them how much we want them to stay
@rsupwoods It's a total myth that we will have a carrier ready for flight trials and no planes; don't be taken in!
@rsupwoods  No, 2017 is the start of sea trials and the F35 will be available in sufficient numbers from 2018 to start flying at right time
@rsupwoods ... as airpower and the F35 will be available as first carrier completes sea trials, just as we always planned
@rsupwoods Happily you are wrong on both counts: F35 not due in service for years; we have Tornadoes and increasingly capable Typhoons

@ChloeSmithMP Worcester & Norwich lines serve very similar populations but we have half your trains AND they’re slower & much less reliable

@English_Woman why do you use such aggressive language? Your opinion is inevitably diminished by your aggression
100% support so far from constituents backing banning smoking in cars with children although enforcement acknowledged as a problem
@oxjustice  Are you REALLY saying I shouldn't seek the views of voters?! Using social media is only one way of doing so, but a useful one

I'm delighted Mid Worcestershire Conservatives have opted for an open primary to choose my successor giving every voter chance to have a say
At his farewell to Droitwich tonight Father @dougchaplin spoke powerfully of new sense of life and hope n the Spa - and he's 100% right
Earlier Droitwich mayor Tom Noyes led really encouraging meeting on future of town's brine baths - more cause for hope for the Spa
@ConHome @AdamAfriyie @jameswhartonmp In real world of Parliamentary procedure Afryie's amendemnt only makes it easier to kill the bill
@deletedbyMPs  I hope you will correct your systems to distinguish accurately who is deleting after your misleading tweet yesterday
“@defense_news: UK's Hammond: More Budget Cuts Could Bring Structural Cuts http://t.co/EAmkIyU0im”
@deletedbyMPs @STEMNET I didn't delete this - it was a great event and STEMNET is a great initiative
@BBCr4today Very sorry to hear your dismissive tone on British manufacturing this morning; there are many more success stories to report!
@BLOODHOUND_SSC one of the highlights of #DSEi; great to see enthusiasm of their supply chain which includes some vibrant SMEs
Government slipped out the first stage of the Defence Growth Partnership on Monday: it says little specific but sets the right agenda
@AJElwell I'm not surprised - Defence has some really outstanding SMEs as I saw again only yesterday at DSEi
@GDElwell @SleemanEng I would be delighted. You know where to find me.
@trussliz That's the plan! I'm working with @Science_Grrl to develop ideas to do just that
Yes - encouraging developments and trends but we need to do much more to secure our prosperity and security
Encouraged by positive mood at #DSEi2013 but engineering skills shortage remains a real worry for defence and wider manufacturing
Government decision to abandon Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme bad news for Worcestershire growers and means increased food imports
New and greatly improved #D&T Curriculum will help to inspire a new generation of engineers and scientists https://t.co/TVC4ql0TaI
A big thank you to education minister @trussliz for the new Design and Technology curriculum, confirmed today https://t.co/TVC4ql0TaI
This is very significant and welcome - better careers guidance central to solving engineering skills shortage http://t.co/81NpscyAs1
"@EAL_Awards: Skills Minister @matthancockmp has responded to the Ofsted report on careers guidance in schools http://t.co/81NpscyAs1"
"@defense_news: UK's Hammond Announces Missile Deal http://t.co/ERmsNgoAAV" Great news for the RN and UK industry
#dfid UK is at the forefront of the humanitarian response, the 2nd largest donor to #Syria crisis after the US. Others need to step up
@ravensrod Try reading the words! Facts are awkward things, I know, but they matter.
"@profeng: There's 'soaring demand' for oil & gas engineers says GE Oil & Gas chief exec http://t.co/yUrRoj319Y": typical of all engineering
Charities and campaigners should be fully reassured about Lobbying Bill if they read this: http://t.co/g0EpWGx3xb
@Worutd You will understand, I am sure, that I do not agree with you but I am genuinely sorry you feel this way about important reforms
Today's Lobbying Bill is a perfect example of where the shrillness of 38 Degrees unhelpfully overwhelms the power of. rational argument
@missnfranchised Agreed, but the noise 38 Degrees has generated makes those other, more rational voices, harder to hear
@Worutd What?
@DouglasCarswell That's one good argument for the bill, then!
@missnfranchised Yes, but they are the ones filling my email inbox with identical emails!  You may like to read this: http://t.co/5oHwKyEovh
@missnfranchised I honestly think 38 degrees has (yet again!) misunderstood the issue; there will be a full statement on my website shortly
@AlanGAnderson The text of last Thursday's motion on Syria can be read here, at the beginning of the PM's speech: http://t.co/ZEvnhMdjU3
@alan_gilmour Please read the statement on my website which explains why I believe you are seriously mistaken
@Eden_Ethan Then let's talk up Evesham! E.g its many festivals, Regal Cinema, beautiful riverside, pivotal role in English history..........
Why the Commons was wrong about Thursday's vote but still right to be sceptical about military intervention in Syria http://t.co/LgpUGPpoDP
@Eden_Ethan but we do need to support the Bell Tower appeal and the fund raising for the Almonry to keep these two great Evesham assets
@Eden_Ethan Evesham is beautifully maintained too - Workman  Gardens,  Abbey Gardens, Market Square, the Bell Tower, Almonry etc
@DouglasCarswell The wonder is that humanity is in permanent revolution; it's just overthrowing monarchs I'm not keen on
@DouglasCarswell The real tragedy is that we had a revolution at all!
@alan_gilmour That would have been the issue for the second vote, the vote that won't now happen
@AlanGAnderson which was what the government's motion said too, just in different words
@alan_gilmour It condemned Assad, embraced the UN process & required a further vote before military action; all MPs should have voted for it
@AlanGAnderson My understanding is that we can now take no action in any circumstances, whatever the evidence, and I'm worried about that
@TBawler Why? 140 characters are very limiting for complexity of most issues people want to talk about
Sad that Labour politicising debate on #Syria by insisting on their amendment but opposing the government motion which amounts to same thing
@deletedbyMPs what is the point of @deletedbyMPs?
@LordCornelius now that's a new perspective!
I've read thousands of words on Syria, all summed up perfectly in @FT cartoon: "The West can't just stand by and not do something stupid"
Promise of further Commons vote before any specific military intervention in #Syria is the right approach
I'm not yet convinced military action will achieve required objective in #Syria but today's Commons motion is good one that deserves support
So far I've had more emails on cycling and badger culls than Syria; it would be good to know what my constituents think about intervening
@JFLorg Yes. And AdmIral are generally better regarded than most pubcos, aren't they?
@SteveC2712 More still needs to be done to protect tenants but we mustn't end up where we began 25 years ago with the big brewers in control
@heffalunk Agreed. It's just a question of making sure the government's code doesn't create new problems for publicans and smaller brewers
Grateful for the many Tweets on pubcos. One worry is the big brewers may just replace pubcos and we're back where we started 25 years ago
An MP's never off duty; my barber's just lobbied me about changes to New Homes Bonus while cutting my hair. And he's right to be worried.
@NDI_UK Shame we couldn't have kept the War Office and sold Main Building!
@top1percentile you should talk to @ladygeek and @Science_Grrl
@top1percentile And those schools are wrong aren't they, @Science_Grrl?
@top1percentile Schools are actively discouraging girls from pursuing physics and engineering because they don't think they're for girls
@oflynnexpress And you could not be more wrong Patrick; short term jail sentences can do real harm & cost taxpayers a lot too

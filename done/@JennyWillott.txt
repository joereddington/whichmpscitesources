@Paul_Wilding1 @LibDems We're doing our best! Labour crashed the economy, everyone was affected. NMW gone up 13% since 2010, and inc tax cut Tue Mar 17 12:27:44 GMT 2015
@LatentHankMoody @JoshPopeInc No - IPSA have said they haven't decided what to do, so will launch a consultation after election Tue Mar 17 12:25:52 GMT 2015

@DCopinger @LibDems Not true - it went up by 3% last year too, but inflation is lower this year. It's gone up 13% since @LibDems in Govt Tue Mar 17 12:21:14 GMT 2015
@kledon Good question - don't know off the top of my head, but salaries are going up faster than inflation, so presumably not? Tue Mar 17 12:12:30 GMT 2015
@LatentHankMoody @JoshPopeInc MPs haven't had a 9% increase Tue Mar 17 12:11:08 GMT 2015

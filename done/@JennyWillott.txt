@simmoleigh Not online. We have drives but usb port was broken so couldn't download. They wiped all parliamentary software so now useless
If they'd told me they'd wipe it I'd have taken it to Crwys Rd and paid for repairs @curryspcworld @asusuk I'm seriously upset
Never using @curryspcworld @asusuk again. After 33 days for basic repairs my tablet completely wiped -lost all photos & can't access diary
Thanks! It seems to be moving now - I'll hopefully be back online properly soon @simmoleigh
@LucyStevo13 In US manufacturers add bittering agent voluntarily. UK Gov thinks its up to them - some already add, hope others will follow.
@LucyStevo13 As cat owner I understand v upsetting. Deliberate poisoning is crime & police matter. People should keep chemicals safe at home
V fed up with @asusuk I totally rely on my tablet & they've had it to repair for 33 days! Why take so long, and why never answer the phone?

Delighted by Church of England synod decision on women bishops. Where Wales leads, England follows!
Good meeting with @cftrust to talk about lung transplants. Tragic how many young people wait too long - promised to do what I can to help.
Delighted Ros Altmann is new Govt Champion for older workers. She'll be excellent - and good to see another WBC recommendation implemented
Just been to official opening of Bryn Celyn Primary. Lovely new school and the kids were wonderful - I particularly enjoyed the singing!
Glad to hear @TheClinkCharity restaurant in Cardiff prison is opening Wed evening & Sunday lunch: serves great food & gives prisoners skills
Stuff mag done same as Loaded "Technology is universal, but pics of models aren't universally appealing" - quite right. Women like tech too!
Good news Loaded mag dropping semi-naked women on cover. They said most change driven by readers "saying we’d lost touch with them" - good!
@the_puffy_shirt @LibDems True - the more awareness we can raise the better.
@the_puffy_shirt @LibDems Absolutely - though far fewer. About 80 men die every year, though that's I agree that's 80 too many.
I've #spreadtheword about breast cancer because 12,000 women dying every year is 12,000 too many. http://t.co/B3YVvf7ehY
@gabyhinsliff @EverydaySexism Seems we know what the problem is but finding the solution is much harder...
@gabyhinsliff @EverydaySexism I agree too. Not sure what will help. Had a good session when I was minister on role of men in changing things
@SamTaylor35 Anyone who's interested, I'm happy to advise!
@SamTaylor35 Get involved community, join political pty, get work exp or internship in Assembly/Parliament, stand for Council, lots of ways!
@gabyhinsliff @janemerrick23 And you're right we need to help women with children stay in careers - we all lose out if so many women opt out
@gabyhinsliff Sorry - that'll teach me to tweet and (try to) listen at the same time! It was a good session tho - lots to make us think...
@SamTaylor35 I agree - we need far more women in Parliament, and in the media - and it's not as if there aren't enough good women to do it!
@everydaysexism Laura Bates says a career adviser told a girl "you'd be a good MP's wife!" How will we ever change politics!? #viewsnotshoes
More coverage of party leaders' wives at last election than of female politicians! That's v depressing... #viewsnotshoes
Research shows women MPs get far less coverage than male MPs #viewsnotshoes
@gabyhinsliff says used to be 4 political editors in Parliamentary lobby, now 1, and that affects portrayal of women MPs #viewsnotshoes
@gabyhinsliff quite right that people think they can get away with misogyny online - they wouldn't say it to their face.
Good on Bernard Jenkin for co-chairing meeting on sex equality in Parliament - a token man, one of just 2 men in a room with over 50 women!
Great event today #getgirlscoding. Was taught basic coding by girls from @LakesideCardiff V impressed - clearly coding stars of the future!

I just told @SkyNews that PMQs 'makes good theatre but lousy politics'. Do you agree?

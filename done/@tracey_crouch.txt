@JoeboyHaughey23 good. So take that polling card in your hand down to the station & vote Kelly :)
@RonProwse @KellyTolhurst morning Ron. I respect you a lot but UKIP aren't going to form Gov so only one party is going to deliver ref on EU
@JoeboyHaughey23 oh I will - as soon as this by-election is over!!!
@JoeboyHaughey23 you've got an issue at a GP surgery near you - the previous MP has done nothing - I will ensure she picks it up
@JoeboyHaughey23 OK beyond the stuff you've already read, she is passionate about area & she'll work hard in Parl - I'll look after her.

Popped round to neighbour's for break. Entertained sprogs by turning kettle into a minion #whydontyougeneration http://t.co/wVIKwWkEMo
My God son's christening, niece's birthday party & a few hours with sailors on board HMS Lancaster. Lovely day all round

Girls won penultimate league match of season, securing 2nd with game in hand. Hurrah!
Good to meet @alzheimerssoc in Chatham regarding a new local Dementia Action Alliance
@henrywinter that's not very fair...
About to retweet and then report a foul tweet to me. Why do people think they can say things like this?
@rdsmithTW who doesn't and I hope everyone drives appropriately and gets home safe
@KM_newsroom Holcombe Hockey club
Girls football training tonight is cancelled due to snow on pitch but forecast for match on Sunday is 17C...crazy spring weather
Thank you to parents & organisations who helped me raise the sensitive & tragic issue of stillbirth in Commons today.
@paulwaugh and the two dozen @BlueFoxCAFH supporting MPs

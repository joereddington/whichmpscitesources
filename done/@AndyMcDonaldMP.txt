Lib Dems candidate claiming "things seem to be getting worse, not better"...they are in government!
Lib Dems have sent me a letter. How nice of them! Bad timing, they can't claim to be the party of jobs & support the failing work programme.
The sun has come out in Park ward. Out in University, Thorntree and Linthorpe wards today. Come and join me!
Work programme stats show that the scheme isn't working. A real shambles that isn't addressing fears on jobs in Middlesbrough.
On the BBC Tees debate this morning. Tories complacent on soaring youth unemployment in town.

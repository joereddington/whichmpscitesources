Maggie, who worked with Angus when they were young journalists, and I will miss him terribly.

Our thoughts are with his family. 2/2
Angus MacLeod was a gentleman in every sense of the word. He is a huge loss to journalism. 1/2
An extraordinary night. Humbled by the level of support and the efforts of our volunteers. Will give speech in Glasgow shortly. #indyref
Just hours before we make our irrversable choice a leak shows the SNP secretly plan £450m in NHS cuts. Equivalent of 15k nurses #indyref
The costs & risks of separation are real. When they were underdogs the nationalists could avoid & evade big questions. No longer. #indyref
This isn't the Battle of Britain- it's the battle for Scotland, for our children & generations to come. It's a battle we will win. #indyref
The polls may conflict but message I take is clear: If you want Scotland to remain part of the UK family you have to vote for it. #indyref
I'm guest editing the @Daily_Record tomorrow. Some great exclusives. Make sure you buy a copy. #indyref #NoThanks http://t.co/nXSY6wr2P2

Moody's report shows if we leave UK we'll pay more for mortgages, credit cards & loans- the real cost of independence http://t.co/7DGYZ7Jh0G
Margo was one of the warmest and most determined women I ever met, I shall miss her very much. My thoughts are with Jim and the family.
Good visit to manufacturer in Port Glasgow. Like so many employers they say staying in UK means more jobs #indyref http://t.co/PouM8d2nWg
SNP forced into rewriting Independence White Paper oil numbers & public spending plans. Shambles.  http://t.co/pg8iZt4S8a #indyref
Watch @ScottishLabour's #BetterTogether video - 'With your help, we will win in September' http://t.co/zuCiCEBcjs #indyref
Great speech by @JohannLamont. @ScottishLabour's commitment to strengthening devolution is clear. Find out more here http://t.co/O4g9LgfSSy
6 months to go & #indyref choice is clear. More powers for Scots Parliament & back-up of UK OR losing pound & losing jobs with independence.
Risks of leaving UK clear in huge drop in oil revenues announced by SNP. Would have meant cuts or tax rises #indyref http://t.co/6ySI21U5dj
Excellent new video from @UK_Together on why the strength, security & stability of £ matters to Scotland. https://t.co/qNtKGExbt4 #indyref
Standard Life & RBS reports highlight the risk of losing security & strength of the Pound. It is clear independence will cost jobs. #indyref
Alex Salmond now pretending the last week never happened. We still don't know what money we would use after independence. #indyref
On replacing the pound and on EU membership, Alex Salmond is a man without a plan. Tomorrow he must face up to reality. #indyref
.@AlexSalmond Not good enough. We can't gamble on something as important as our currency. What is plan B? € or separate currency? #indyref
If we leave the UK we lose £. Salmond MUST say what money we'd use. Join € or an unproven separate currency? #indyref http://t.co/QEWvJ4HM62
Biggest intervention in #indyref so far. Bob Dudley right on concerns about future of pound. http://t.co/mFc4loSUwA http://t.co/sqQurqZuG6

Salmond’s Pound claims have been quietly demolished by the Bank of England Governor http://t.co/MVRAHMQTwy #indyref

Read the speech I gave this morning in Edinburgh - 'No borders between our young people and opportunity' http://t.co/iEKNdtffAU #indyref
The #indyref isn't a theoretical discussion. The risks to families are real. Salmond debt default would put up mortgage & credit card bills.
Salmond looked v uncomfortable asked about legal advice on EU/tuition fees. Given his form on this he must publish if he has it. #indyref

Increasingly obvious the idea of a currency union is dead in the water. What's the Plan B? http://t.co/DYeXsmh2AJ #indyref
Sturgeon's line on childcare astonishing, complaint is that women would get jobs & pay tax to HMT - that then transfers money back to Scot
1hr to go & Nicola Sturgeon threatens debt default if she doesn't get her way on currency. What would that mean for your mortgage? #indyref
New blog ahead of publication of SNP manifesto for breaking up UK. Presumptions and the price independence. http://t.co/86ZvB3sfH9 #indyref
New blog on today's @TheIFS report and how independence is a financial risk we don’t need to take http://t.co/4u0mFSh3mM #indyref
Asked Q on #grangemouth. Would be tragedy to lose jobs & losing site would leave huge hole in economy. Everyone needs to get around table.
I am glad that @AlexSalmond has backed down and will now debate with me before #indyref. Let's get on and make it happen.
Read my blog on the historic shift in the #indyref debate that you may not have noticed http://t.co/KOrimMx3s6 #bettertogether
The SNP have deliberately set out to deceive the Scottish public. Their oil fund will put your taxes up http://t.co/gMqSu2Souf #indyref
NEW BLOG - SNP's 'instability fund' is admission of need for tax rises or cuts to deal with oil volatility. http://t.co/JUgOzmjLnN #indyref
Nicola Sturgeon on Radio Scotland said she was sure pension pledge was affordable...but couldn't say how much it cost. Credible? #indyref

Great launch event for our new office in Aberdeen. Thanks to everyone who came. #indyref http://t.co/tRNY2CvqnB
Salmond says oil = £300k for every man, woman & child in Scotland. We know if something sounds too good to be true, it isn't true. #IndyRef
My recent #bettertogether lecture has been published as a pamphlet with additional analysis here http://t.co/U1GuMXRuDN #indyref
Today’s OBR oil forecasts expose the weakness of the SNP case for separation http://t.co/VXqGBSuXJ0 #indyref

FM talking about me again at #FMQs . Still won't debate me though. Notable that he refused to rule out a a separate currency after #IndyRef
Chair of YesScotland has come out for a separate currency. As their currency confusion escalates, their credibility has evaporated #indyref
Economists dismiss Nationalist arguments for Eurozone-style Sterlingzone http://t.co/RUjaEigTUk #IndyRef #bettertogether
Damning report by Institute of Chartered Accountants on pension problems caused by independence. Cannot simply be dismissed by SNP. #indyref
Salmond seems keen to talk about me at FMQs. I wish he was as keen to answer my simple questions on currency post #IndyRef #FMQs
I was debating #IndyRef currency issue on #bbcdp earlier. Now up on iPlayer if you missed it: http://t.co/KQ4cbMhYQ7
Just listened to @johnswinney on today. Twice refused to rule out separate Scottish currency after #indyref. Is snp position finally moving?

Thanks for following. You can also follow the debate on http://t.co/F7NcAtk1KU #bettertogether
By the way, on GDP figures he often quotes. Here is a warning from p43 of FM's own fiscal commission. #snp13 #indyref http://t.co/KiLlXVEG9w
Is that it? Heavy on assertions but weak on any detail on what a separate Scotland would actually mean. No wonder he won’t debate. #snp13
We have never said we can't go it alone. The question is it better to go it alone. To decide that we need facts and debate. #indyref #snp13
How does this section sit with handing power over currency and spending to what would then be a foreign government? #snp13 #indyref
We all love the NHS. We also value ability to get specialist care cost-free & hassle free anywhere in UK NHS. #snp13 http://t.co/JWB730QeEL
Just this morning clear majority rejected removing representation from Westminster.http://t.co/Ni59aoR0Mi #snp13 #indyref
If the FM is serious about trusting the Scottish people will he finally let us see the EU legal advice? #indyref #snp13
Here we go... How much detail will we hear about what independence actually means? #indyref #bettertogether

@mikesey1 Thanks for interaction, but incorrect. I've been speaking out for years + I didn't choose timing of vote. http://t.co/ufTfi4UUSd Mon Feb 02 13:47:02 GMT 2015
#fracking is anti-business. Will pollute water & air, put green jobs, tourism and agriculture at risk via @CityAM http://t.co/WFyWQ390X7 Mon Feb 02 13:30:15 GMT 2015
Just left @redbrickglaston hustings, lively enjoyable debate, wide variety local & nat issues. Shame on Tory, UKIP and Labour, chairs empty! Sun Feb 01 22:18:01 GMT 2015

@pallantarundel You might have missed that the bypass announcement included sustainable transport measures at Arundel, so we shd get both. Tue Apr 28 09:15:41 BST 2015

Chris Leslie cites abolishing PCC elections as way Lab will save. But (1) only c.£12m pa (2) Lab manifesto spends the money. No credibility. Thu Apr 23 08:59:34 BST 2015
@wsgazette Hi, I'd like to retweet this but you've got the constituency name wrong (on yr website too) - ARUNDEL & South Downs. Cld u amend? Thu Apr 23 08:19:44 BST 2015

Delighted this commitment to global vaccine & drug R&D is in our @Conservatives manifesto - will save a lot of lives http://t.co/OB69zzEj7K Tue Apr 14 13:45:49 BST 2015
So Lab wld delay A27 improvements that @simonkirby4mp fought hard to win - they obviously don't care about traffic or investment in Brighton Mon Apr 13 15:30:44 BST 2015
Users of congested A27, local economy & environment will continue to suffer if Labour are elected. They cancelled Arundel bypass before. Mon Apr 13 13:49:04 BST 2015
Read small print. Lab manifesto claims they'll invest in strategic roads. Briefing says they'll "delay" A27 upgrade http://t.co/Tsc7qH4Kwv Mon Apr 13 13:48:53 BST 2015

@Lyndon_Harris @JonDMack Who said sentence is halved? We're talking about custodial term. Your only response is to traduce us. Unimpressive.
@Lyndon_Harris @JonDMack Pathetic. In last Con Manifesto. Grayling has made start for some offences. Imagine you knew this, chose to ignore.
@Lyndon_Harris @JonDMack **sigh** I oppose automatic early release. I led moves to focus on rehab. Wonder why you choose not to understand.
@Lyndon_Harris Of course! Clifford needs his jail term halved to get four years of "support to reintegrate". How could I have missed this?
@Francis_Hoar Or have min-max sentences which is what I suggested. At least don't pretend it's an 8yr prison term which is what public hear.

@chrisdeerin It takes two to tango :-)
@chrisdeerin Indeed, and it would be equally good to see the @Telegraph remembering the same thing.
@WSCT_Joshua Yes and it's a really bad idea - unwanted, unnecessary and unsustainable. Nowhere near a railway line. Outside Mid-Sussex plan.
Powerful letter from the Bishop of Salisbury endorsing gay marriage. There's a link to the full text in the article. http://t.co/BKNA5z16hc

Baz Luhrmann's @GatsbyMovie in 3D was like nothing I've seen before. Extravagant, mesmerising. If you want to roar with the 20s go see it.
Thank you @bbctms for telling us about Bob Blair's rather inspiring story of sporting courage http://t.co/UB8l9gAP2g

Great meeting with the US @freedomtomarry campaign. Amazingly  swift change with 12 states + DC now legalising gay marriage & more expected.
Good to have drink with my friend @davidburrowesmp after equal marriage Bill vote. We toasted Party & shared determination to win election.
On 3rd Reading of Bill @paulswaddle for @Freedom2MarryUK praises leadership of @David_Cameron on equal marriage http://t.co/wMd4YAl11i
The Lords always have important scrutiny job, but can't ignore fact that this BIll passed the elected House with a 2:1 cross-party majority.
Delighted that Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill received Third Reading by another decisive majority. Number of Tory opponents actually fell.

125 Con Party activists have just signed letter to PM supporting gay marriage Bill. 30 'grassroots' antis don't speak for all. Details soon.
Interesting @YouGov poll finding from @JoeTwyman - less than 1 in 10 non-married heteros in relationship wld like to be in civil partnership
A tale of two worlds: 15 countries legalise gay marriage, others pass repressive laws. My article in Sun Times (£): http://t.co/kHoBg1COS8
CofE also says civil partnerships for heterosexual couples would introduce "confusion" and says this view is endorsed by @ABCJustin (2/2)
Interesting: CofE still opposes gay marriage but says 'quadruple lock' "does achieve Govt's policy intentions" http://t.co/SqQCNmEKlo (1/2)
Great news: superfast broadband to be rolled out to around 98% of West Sussex homes & businesses within next 3 years http://t.co/AJhGKOtfrr
Ask why anti gay marriage MPs suddenly discover equality & back civil partnerships for heteros. My @ConHome article http://t.co/Jc2cfzuExf
Good outcome of mtg w @networkrail - they've agreed to look at potential for new Arundel chord & making more use of Horsham-Dorking-Lon line

@iantruin thanks - yes - shields up! Had meeting about this with parish council chairmen yesterday. On case.
So, as yet another poll confirms big majority of public support gay marriage, a few anti MPs demand a referendum on the issue.  Geniuses.

What a gent! Sir Roger Moore talking sense about the nonsense that is the feminist agenda. More women in work means fewer jobs for the boys!
Train back to London this morning had no first class carriage! Forced to sit with the ordinary folk. Ghastly.
Nothing like a sunday morning shoot. Almost came a cropper when one of the farm-hands came into my line of sight! Now there's a bit of game!
Thought I'd chance an Autumn stroll a long Weymouth sea-front this morn. Sad to say Grockles still here; some awfully sad specimens about.
Reading today's Echo. Simply awful story about some young miscreants who've been tearing it up in Weymouth overnight: the feral underclass.

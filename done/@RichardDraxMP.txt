@Christopherdhb why is is ok for you bother me with your trivia?! Thu Apr 23 07:48:00 BST 2015
.@redshark_tv I'm an MP, I drive wherever the ruddy hell I want! Wed Mar 25 17:15:03 GMT 2015
.@bbcmartynoates Absolutely old chap. One needs to be seen doing something in the run up to an election! Wed Mar 25 17:13:32 GMT 2015
.@SenshiRini Guffaw. Not at all - I think I'm gorgeous too. Wed Mar 25 17:08:20 GMT 2015
.@Ranelagh_intl What with an election looming, one ought to make the odd intervention! Wed Mar 25 12:20:00 GMT 2015
.@HeatherWheeler Any time, Hev. @nigelevansmp @sheryllmurray @nickherbertmp @Simonhartmp @JulianSmithMP Thu Mar 19 23:11:55 GMT 2015
.@LabourEoin And, if nothing else, Parliament urgently needs the talents of more part-time, double-jobbing, self-interested shits. 2/2 Wed Feb 25 22:36:38 GMT 2015
.@LabourEoin Absolutely right, too. Expecting MPs to survive on such a paltry wage will only deter so many other self-interested shits. 1/2 Wed Feb 25 22:32:41 GMT 2015
What's the ruddy point of being an MP if one can't use all that spare time and influence to make a decent wage on the side?! Wed Feb 25 18:04:32 GMT 2015
@frackfree_eu tosh! Better than those ruddy windmills! Mon Feb 23 18:11:34 GMT 2015

@juliaannlloyd indeed - but there is room for expansion built in but be advised it will be a hard fight
@juliaannlloyd certainly not fit for purpose now given state of properties but agree A&E is still worth arguing for, but elective crucial

@Che_Stel @ShootTheDefence no worries - what a great idea you all have with this program
@ShootTheDefence thoroughly enjoyed that !
@grumpyboy yes and the CCG (GPS) they are commissioners of services
@grumpyboy agree - one page on web site talks about that campaign continuing- there  is room for expansion on site despite what claimed...
@grumpyboy it's all on my web site as it develops I will never give up arguing for it even as re-build happens
Proud to be supporting #trusteesweek this week to say thank you for all the fantastic work trustees do in Enfield North.
@Andrew_InStre @Fran_Abebreseh @metpoliceuk cynic -:)

@fatima_jaffer depends ....
@SeemaChandwani I am sure there will be some ....
This will be fun - am attending Enfield Island Youth Centre to join in cookery class!
@Bionic1947 then that would condemn every policeman, doctor teacher which would be wrong of course
@MarkGriffin59 I think you can trust parliament to deliver come what may- after all this is not a compliant subservient parliament!
@riomegan I think it's two months - amazing displAy
‚Äú@natyouthagency: We hope @nickdebois enjoys his time meeting the young people at @youthenfield today for #GiveanHour #YWW14‚Äù I am cooking!
@grumpyboy Yep - I don't think I have left anyone in doubt -:)
@Bionic1947 yes there is abs to generalise is in my opinion wrong
@deborahdark7 @AndrewSymeou1 not by all -:)
@MarcDawson4 @GOsborneGenius that's not the point you made -
@Cumpedelibero don't be fooled into thinking Labours motion was anything g but party politics though
@ELIZABETHWHYCER congrats !
@trixysanderson @AndrewSymeou1 absolutely share that view
@MarcDawson4 @GOsborneGenius which is exactly what you have just done #ironic
@AndrewSymeou1 there you go just made your tweet written into Hansard parliamentary record
@AndrewSymeou1 quite so
@MarcDawson4 I'm not trying to score points I'm pointing out the absurdity of it today -my constituent @AndrewSymeou1 deserved better
@AndrewSymeou1 astonishing that we don't have a motion to vote on the actual EAW - and now debate is being stifled by a further motion
@thejimsmith well given they regularly don't vote with Gov that's no surprise -:)
@MarkGriffin59 in fairness I don't think he would have had a hand in the tactics today
Given that Gov, Lab & Lib Dems  want to all go back into EAW it's extraordinary that today's parliamentary process has ended up in this mess
Bizarre- so technically we are not voting on the European Arrest Warrant then ...
@elenicourea I am sorry it is just not going to be able to work - I have tried sorry!
@deborahdark7 well I am sorry it has come to this - very sorry indeed
‚Äú@EmmaLYDS: Thanks so much for attending the #lyds ball @nickdebois http://t.co/h6o5Tv7TrK‚Äù great charity event as ever
@deborahdark7 @ConHome I am sure it will be - how do you feel about the proposals?
@CarolynRamsamy apparently not of the church list correct -we have had some serious injuries
Every name of the fallen from the parish from WW1,WW2 and Falklands read out at St Andrews,Enfield- very thought provoking
@3rdenfieldbb thank you for the photo -well done today !
@sqwawk @PoppyLegion much gnashing of teeth, have begun writing #glasses
Excellent organisation for Rememberence Day service and  reception by @PoppyLegion #Enfield branch..next stop St Andrews
@Che_Stel thanks have a good evening
@Che_Stel no - that's inevitable in this job but at least I hope people are always clear on what my position is even if they don't approve!
@Che_Stel  @sophielstephens  I wouldn't opposes changes to probation service and he has never forgiven me - he is a probation officer
@Che_Stel  @sophielstephens this chap has an almost obsessive mission against me - and no accountability on Twitter for what he says
@MarkGriffin59 I wouldn't opposes changes to probation service and he has never forgiven me - he is a probation officer
@MarkGriffin59 this guy has an obsession with me and is spouting rubbish but that's Twitter I am afraid - no accountability.

@MarkGriffin59 I believe treatment should be the end game but within criminal justice system ( and not always in jail)
@MarkGriffin59 he is talking about decriminalising addict - but died that mean an assault and robbery to feed habit is overlooked or not..
@MarkGriffin59 I have always maintained that the addict is a health problem and focus should be on dealers - but...
@MarkGriffin59 it's a back bench debate but not binding on gov
@MarkGriffin59 no problem with re-think but mental health issues leave lots if doubt about wisdom -key is to examine if uptake different
@MarkGriffin59 hmmm not convinced - but going to look at evidence
@AndyU73 theoretically but big gap to close
@Dorset_Politico -:)
@scottagnelson yes unless standard comm said otherwise- had our amendments gone through constituents would decide
@Doctorwhizz @davidburrowesmp bad idea
@pmrourkie really - thank you for the tip

@Zehra_Zaidi that's very decent of you thank you !
@AndyU73 at House not watching
@MarkFoxNews but still loads of time nevertheless cheers
@AndyU73 I suspect they won't try now, but I see Lab policy for next Mayor is to build on golf courses and green belt - should do brownfield
@MarkFoxNews wrong - unless you want us to ignore manifesto
@AndyU73 it was a published option for consultation exactly
@AndyU73 @AndyU73 well don't take my word for it ask you councillors -:) honest guv
@AndyU73 it was listed at the Town Show in the Council's official tent as an option to consult on from memory
@DamianAStuart I am not convinced by this argument -essentially because I think voters back people who take a stand on principle regardless
Substantial opposition on Labour benches ( not by all) against real recall - why don't they trust voters?
Finally @ZacGoldsmith is able to launch report stage without amendments to deliver "Real Recall"
Looking forward to this evenings reception,Q&A and network event here at the House of Commons for local Enfield businesses
@SimonScottuk i get that, and know that the reason for example today is about HS3 is to focus the minds on this gov not being SE centric
@SimonScottuk no problem
@grumpyboy Yep that definitely the case
@SimonScottuk @uncleporkie because I am a London MP ...
@grumpyboy oh they care - they hope to win with the swing and Cons going to UKIP which is a real threat with a 1600 majority
Watch BBC - Sunday Politics London we covered smoking ban proposals, Green Party emergence & plenty more   http://t.co/wbIUU6TA57

@hutchcomms @RdioHelp hope you have not run metrics on my tweets -:) see you later
@Puffles2010 as with John Major
@Puffles2010 I like him on a personal basis, very personable individual but in the chamber much like what you see
Off soon to join @iancollinsuk for the 9pm slot on tonight's show on @LBC - shame Not for current subject - what's wrong with Ed Milliband
@PRCAIngham stop it!
@UKIPWellingboro @MikkiL gosh you get wound easily - check out y Twitter feed I think you may realise how daft that comment was
@BubblesWong thank you team great effort as usual!
@UKIPWellingboro @MikkiL no multi tasking then - don't worry I know you can't give a direct answer have a good weekend
@MikkiL @UKIPWellingboro still can't answer the point - political rhetoric from you and avoiding answering question #Shame
@ValsonthePark taking up it responding to local issues with residents - for example updating in action taken against nighttime racers on A10
@MikkiL @UKIPWellingboro All of that dies not change fact you won't get your referendum by voting UKIP - no one in UKIP can prove otherwise
@UKIPWellingboro keep saying it as much as you like but not one poll agrees with you
@MikkiL @UKIPWellingboro and by voting UKIP you won't be leaving EU -your call
Lunch time break for the Enfield North Action Day -thank  you  all! http://t.co/12Ma7K2HAf
@UKIPWellingboro @MikkiL problem with that is vote  UKIP and may well win a few seats but get Labour majority and no referendum
@grumpyboy @BubblesWong @BGBConservative @sps81 @WorldofDinah @Matt4BGandB it started 4 years ago -:)

@grumpyboy no I didn't not yet
@LouiseMensch @allanholloway quite and that was Nov 2009 and Kippers know that of course
@allanholloway @LouiseMensch no -sadly that commitment was dropped in Nov 2009 I believe
@mixedmatt @SkyNews does not make it any less true - it's UKIP who want to see Cons out of office and deny UK a referendum
@nesscottage @AMMorrisMP but 20 years adjustment ...that doc says 4 years
@grumpyboy eh...thank you -:)
@Scribbles123 good to have a decent end of week report -:) have a good weekend
@SuzanneEvans1 @SkyNews hmmm fair point
@Mowman123 @AMMorrisMP @SkyNews I think I did just that -:)
@barhamm I wish...but thanks!
@juliaannlloyd @SkyNews thanks for feedback much appreciated
@Scribbles123 well that's true but my point was they can only go back 6 years not 20!
@mixedmatt @SkyNews it will be for the British people to decide not the politicians
Joining @SkyNews shortly on #EU absurd behaviour today
@Chris1ll cheers -appreciate that- we can disagree and probably always will but  respect that
@hawks_mk @BrandonLewis  not quite sure where I said that but still, why let the facts ruin your tweet ?
@ahawksbee best not let work get in the way of all that ...-:)
@huwptddavies so you don't want deal with economy -without a good economy we don't have the best public services #SameOldLeft
@premitrom thank you - appreciate that
@MarkGriffin59 glad you have standards !
@elenicourea I saw it just now but diary doesn't look good - I am going to speak to office see if I can move anything
Growth up by 0.5% in production, 0.8% in construction and 0.3% in agriculture-underlying breadth of recovery-not all down to services
With growth up 3% on a year ago we do lead the pack in what is still a very  uncertain global economy- not time to change to Labour!
@Chris1ll you said we "demanded it " - you are not being honest about the issue
@emmersonslaw actually he would make an excellent Commissioner and kick out all those absurd rules and regulations that keep lawyers busy-:)
@Chris1ll we don't vote on or set pay - you are wrong to suggest anything else
@uncleporkie and better still refuse to pay!
@DavidChandler00 quite
@laffertyclare sorry just seen this
EU asks Britain for an extra ¬£1.7BN while France gets ¬£790m rebate | - my response to this in today's Mail- No!  http://t.co/OOIRlHpN9y
@Chris1ll but they are not - you are wrong
Only the EU would demand more money when everyone is belt tightening. There is only one answer to such a ludicrous demand - No
Only the #EU would want to penalise growing economies to subsidise those that have not made the tough decisions.
Good cross party work to achieve government commitment to independent panel to examine #Primodos @YasminQureshiMP
Absolutely delighted that Minister confirms he will support the motion for an independent panel to examine the tragedy of the #Primodos drug
Shortly speaking in the #Primodos debate - nothing learnt from Thalidomide tragedy it seems
Please @BBCr4today let the NHS CEO deal with the main issue - meeting the spending demands for the growing population

Well into the paper review with @NickFerrariLBC -GPs and dementia payments next ..
@riomegan @LBC @NickFerrariLBC @LFC thank you we need luck!
Off to join @NickFerrariLBC for paper review but sounds like quite a mixed bag of headlines to choose from according to @steveallenshow
@MrsNoBags @RPNKTories see you then now off to @LBC for paper review
@MrsNoBags thank you!

@SUPACALA1 if you are a constituent them please email my office otherwise you must contact your own MP
@Wirral_In_It @deletedbyMPs I plead for mercy
@VendettaBeretta Yep -:)
@nickdebois well I was having an uphill struggle with this recall bill ...
@Welshracer I might have been tweeting about Zac!
Excellent argument being made in Commons by @ZacGoldsmith for "Real Recall" amendments to the Bill before the House
@MichaelDaventry @davidburrowesmp @FamaGaz no I asked not to be incl in the pressrelease and I did not "protest" but agree with gov"concern"
@uncleporkie @leedargue -:)
@uncleporkie I wouldn't agree with that but more rigour and more training required!
@CromwellStuff I can only assume you have not read the amendments that we are arguing for
@Bob__Hudson  thanks and I thought it was very unfair at the weekend -:)
@leedargue except when I am grumpy -:) thanks very much!
It seems whilst we were talking about heroism in parliament our very own Wonder Woman @tracey_crouch was in action! http://t.co/pzEku5N1Td
@leedargue no that's why reform and rehabilitation key but alternatives hardly overwhelmingly successful
@sendmebackto your alternative is to let armed robbers roam the streets perhaps?
MP Nick de Bois supports longer jail terms for armed robbers | UK | News | Daily Express http://t.co/MpPCjsFEUm)
@primenumber42 clearly you are too prejudiced to have a proper debate,utterly irrelevant comment,perhaps envy?have tried to debate but #bye
@ParsonsIvor @neilweekes there you go - agreement at last
@ParsonsIvor @neilweekes yes exactly "heard" - so much for evidence
@MarkGriffin59 well said sir!
@ParsonsIvor @neilweekes love to meet them but somehow suspect that won't happen somehow..
@ParsonsIvor @neilweekes we are not changing basis of prosecution just sentencing- many yachtsmen prosecuted yet for carrying a knife ?
@GrumpyDenier @Spectator_CH -:)
To kill someone with a knife you first have to carry a knife - Lib Dems are wrong to try a last minute block of mandatory custodial sentence
@FordCarole I do believe we can thrive outside  EU but the driver for me  is less about quotas more about control of our own borders
@CromwellStuff @ZacGoldsmith that's very presumptive and wrong - there are substantive number supporting real recall
@FordCarole I want focus on skilled labour and getting back to work more people who are currently unemployed
@primenumber42 @ZacGoldsmith try this for all info http://t.co/c6IVptKiVV
Admire @ZacGoldsmith work on Real Recall bill and proud to be a co-author of amendments http://t.co/XHWLEIllEk
@lee_junior1 I am sure your 16 followers will agree with your misjudged confidence in being right all the time ! #Bye
@lee_junior1 that's sounds like you don't believe me - feel free to check my record -look we disagree - deal with it
@lee_junior1 that's a feeble comment I did answer and the answer is yes I would and sure they would - and you support ukip #ironic
@lee_junior1 good night
@lee_junior1 I lived, worked, grew a business and traded with EU and elsewhere successfully - my assumptions are drawn on that experience
‚Äú@clivebull: Thanks @nickdebois @AlpMehm @harryph and @unlockingchange I'm back tomorrow at 8 @LBC‚Äù great show thanks
@lee_junior1 @LBC you see plots were they don't exist
@lee_junior1 @LBC we now have exported more to non EU countries than EU - poor management to be dependent on one block ( in decline)
@lee_junior1 @LBC few business plans involve investing in a declining non growth EU market- but equally we will have pref terms
@lee_junior1 @LBC wrong assumption - that economy won't grow because of referendum
@HGVGreg @riomegan @cheekylatte @UKIP keep saying it and you might even believe it ....(again)
@riomegan precisely !
@riomegan @HGVGreg @cheekylatte @LBC @clivebull @UKIP so vote Cons to have a referendum and vote "out"
@HGVGreg @LBC @clivebull @UKIP you should-they will agree that the Farage mission is now about beating Cons not giving public a referendum
@HGVGreg @LBC @clivebull @UKIP keep saying it- you might even believe it one day- only UKIP and Lab want to stop people having a referendum
@CraigWhitington @LBC @clivebull -:)

@_TheGMan @FordCarole fair enough
@MarkGriffin59 @robertsjonathan well said -and a great tweet
@_TheGMan @FordCarole that's not what Nige says http://t.co/w7Mttzpyei
@_TheGMan @FordCarole you are not answering the question -why are you trying to deny British people a ref by helping elect Labour?
@_TheGMan @FordCarole that's what you'd like to believe-don't forget you are the anti Democratic Party -knowingly denying people an EU ref..
@KazuriHomes @AaronBastani @MayorofLondon @standardnews love the hashtag by the way ...
@KazuriHomes @AaronBastani @MayorofLondon @standardnews I do have very clear bias in housing but not quite like that -:)
@AaronBastani @KazuriHomes @MayorofLondon @standardnews very witty spoof
@_TheGMan @FordCarole now there you are completely wrong !
@FordCarole I think she is wrong about her central premise as she confuses two very different methods of coming into the UK
@_TheGMan @FordCarole a fair point!
@FordCarole I have not read it but sounds like she is confusing those seeking refuge and asylum not immigration
@MIAuk @LivUniEvents @MermaidLondon @HelenFirstclass thank you and to you

@Matt4BGandB @Trudi_Hamer @BGBConservative thank you all for your superb efforts see you at the next one
@barhamm @amrish_patel @grantshapps how the left love to spend other people's money
@AndyU73 it has always been busy but turns people around pretty efficiently on the whole with not long waits in my experience
@AndyU73 not true Andy - the reason is people who have early appointments always turn up pre- opening regardless of hour -I defend the unit
@amrish_patel @grantshapps oh yes -we are advising people ...thanks
@BarbaraG22 good point I will remind them
The good news about the late night trains back to Enfield Town is that they are often on time ...
@Chelle_Buckle true - they are a gold team there but if you get there early or when it's busy the queue can stretch into the car park!

@Phil_Gooch @GNRailUK @Ianbarnes2001 @tlupdates which line ?
@Ianbarnes2001 @Phil_Gooch @tlupdates @GNRailUK fine your call- but suspect your issue is with Network Rail not the operator
@Ianbarnes2001 @Phil_Gooch @tlupdates @GNRailUK which service?
@makispeaks @MayorofLondon almost certainly unless substantive re-negotiation

@Smurf_Boy_73 even the leftie blogs agree with me http://t.co/zK9yihh29o
@Smurf_Boy_73 it's a freeze not a cash cut
@Smurf_Boy_73 and incidentally I support the living wage argument- employers not state should be paying wages
@Smurf_Boy_73 the working age benefits freeze saving is targeted for getting people back into work-I agree
@Smurf_Boy_73 was it that bad to lift people out of income tax then with tax free pay up from Lab ¬£6500 to Cons ¬£10500?
@Smurf_Boy_73 @MarionArmer so someone on ¬£42,000 PA is a millionaire on that basis ?No wonder left so out of touch with hard working people
@file088 if you have emailed you will get an answer in due course as my automatic reply will have stated
@file088 as I have said before please email me for advice nick.debois.mp@parliament.uk with your issues I will not do casework on Twitter

@MikeDonohue1 @screwlabour to a party that are working hard to try and deny the people of Britain a referendum ? No thanks
@Tweets2CV @ChrisTRSalmon UKIP - the anti democratic Party knowingly trying to deny the people a referendum  by delivering a Lab govt
@RebelOrcPaladin sorry I forgot to add -just abuse without the ability to string an argument together #Bye
@AndyU73 because without deficit control there can be no return to prosperity for vast majority of families -Lab just don't get it
@AndyU73 key word "think" ..but your choice now is between less tax to help out or not
@AndyU73 except they would have done the same and won't reverse changes..
@supitayaporn @LouiseMensch it usually means they have lost the argument
@CarperJones @LouiseMensch even better UKIP angry with policies announced by PM #ClearlyGood!
@Tolliath in practice I don't see how it couldn't if it's done through tax free allowance but will read detail
@AndyU73 labour "stole" it by spending more every year than we took in taxes for 10 years...
@AndyU73 but with respect more money will be left from pay, 7 day access to GP's -economy recovering allows this, Lab killed it
@malvachat @LouiseMensch excellent- the Left are angry and resorting to foul language - that confirms it - good policies from PM #Blocked
@looseminute good luck tomorrow !
@Andrew_InStre think you will find pensions, saving bonds,  the new employment strategy go some way towards that ?
@Tolliath which is exactly what my previous tweet said
@malvachat @LouiseMensch yes because you don't pay NI until ¬£8000 -having the facts at your disposal helps before commenting
So to summarise No income tax on min wage,fewer people paying 40% tax, lowest corp tax in the G20 That's why I am a Conservative #cpc14
No income tax if you work up to 30 hours on minimum wage #CPC14
Absolutely right that threshold for higher rate income tax to be raised to ¬£50,000 under next Cons govt #CPC14, Have always argued for that
@rapunzelrobot @EnfieldCouncil sorry to hear that - for me to make continuing representations I do need an email please for council & river

@DaveDavies2 still can't answer the charge..you just sound like an old fashioned politician dodging the question
@DaveDavies2 still can't deal with the point can you-you are just blustering #UKIP the party that wants to stop you having a referendum #Bye
@LIAMGERARDGRIFF touched a nerve then - point made good night sparing partner
@LIAMGERARDGRIFF still can't deny it though can you #UKIP -the party that wants to deny you a referendum -:)
@LIAMGERARDGRIFF you don't have an answer do you? You are  trying to stop a Cons government, deliver a Lab govt and deny a referendum
@LIAMGERARDGRIFF you still can't answer the point the can you - you are knowingly being anti democratic -:)
@arrundell_m via a tweet to @Team2015  I am sure they will be in touch and thanks
@arrundell_m look at our own referendum bull for the 2017 referendum - lords killed it off we are trying again
@arrundell_m to get a referendum bill through - legal challenges etc
@DaveDavies2 and answer came there none ...
@arrundell_m it would be impossible now - would like to believe reports it could be bought forward to 2016
@arrundell_m or try to set you up in entrapment -:) !
@DaveDavies2 see you can't answer the point - you are being fundamentally anti democratic trying to stop the people having their say
@arrundell_m sorry I meant UKIP not you I agree love to see it bought forward
@arrundell_m by all means vote UKIP and deny the people a referendum - but at least be honest and accept that's what you are doing
@DaveDavies2 No,because I believe in giving democratic #EUref to the people  whereas UKIP are knowingly preventing that by gifting GE to Lab
Delighted it's open again looked good this evening

@fifibambina think I had to decline that because of commitments when I was invited -but do tweet and I will help promote
@Che_Stel @Delpieri @ShootTheDefence is that an idea for #LFC defence re-structuring ?? what's the link incidentally and sounds like a plan
@fifibambina questions will have to be asked in the House of Commons!

@CraigBurke_ sorry to be a Party pooper : )
Of course a cynic might say I'm flying it in the hope of being offered the shadow Attorney General brief...
@AbiWilks usually comes out in April or when England teams are playing but making a special appearance today.
@CraigBurke_ I want an in/out UK/EU referendum but believe that will only happen by not splitting the vote and so letting Ed Miliband in.
Proudly flying my St George Cross England flag at home. I don't have a white van...but my brother does! http://t.co/25s14K50z1
@CraigBurke_ don't waste your money folks, don't waste your money.

@emmersonslaw @ntfem !! I rest my case m'lud.
@emmersonslaw You sure you're a lawyer?!
@emmersonslaw @ntfem of course it's possible Parliament is ultimately sovereign in the UK and can repeal 2uropean Communities Act 1972.
@emmersonslaw @ntfem That's for the people to decide.
My country comes first @ntfem my party a distant second. I believe my party can only ultimately deliver us an EU referendum in Majority govt
@ntfem with other Cons MPs last year we tried to pass an in/out EU ref bill but LDs & Lab defeated. Will try to reintroduce the bill on 17th
1st: @ntfem don't refer to my constituents as from 'creepy Crawley'; 2nd: the only way to secure an in/out EU poll will be with a Tory govt.
My thanks to @TheHawthCrawley staff this evening - always friendly, helpful and professional.

@danjones0 @crawley_news yeah, I suffer with that traffic too. Down to infrastructure improvements. Been on to Highways Agency re end date.
@radamfi not a problem for the Swiss or Norwegians but as I say, for electorate to decide. Important they get a chance for a choice though.
@radamfi voting Conservative will get you an EU membership referendum - by definition it's then up to the people to decide, not Government.
@radamfi UK citizens live  in and travel to many non EU countries so no reason why if we voted to leave the EU this would be a problem.
Good to see the Employment Allowance helping #Crawley business http://t.co/jOIOezG9UU
@radamfi that's a very erudite question & demonstrates that the issue isn't as straightforward as some claim. Negotiation I guess is key.

CPC14 - PM: Conservatives will raise 40% tax threshold to £50,000
CPC14 - PM: Conservatives will raise tax free personal allowance to £12,500 - Minimum Wage will pay 0% - a reduction for 30 million people.
CPC14 - PM: Conservatives will scrap zero hours contracts.
CPC14 - PM: 1.8m new jobs since 2010 - More employment created in UK than rest of Europe combined.
CPC14 - PM: With devolution to Scotland Conservatives will deliver English votes on English matters.
CPC14 - PM: If you support ISIL you are an enemy of the UK and will be treated as such.
CPC14 - PM: When people see our flag they know it stands for freedom and justice.

@mrsallennumber2 @waynesmith1971 15 years not long enough??!!
@CornishAssembly I agree more powers for Cornwall.
@Domjames45 yes, and counties.
@Jimmydonut @LabourEoin Labour's regional obsession with no respect for established cities, counties or England itself. Of course rejected.
@a_Londoner @HouseOfTwitsCon there will be a constitutional vote, probably same day as General Election.
Clearly a little sensitive @waynesmith1971 about 15 years of Labour constitutional damage (not to mention the economy).
2015 is the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta - the right time for equal constitutional renewal - for England and the rest of the UK.
Blair neglected devolution to England. With rightly more powers to Scotland/Wales we can't let Labour delay English votes on English issues.

@DaveMcUK true, although our strength has been with an evolving constitution over the centuries.
Doing a BBC radio interview about the latest, callous IS hostage propaganda video. As the PM says, murderers and monsters, not Muslims.
2/2 Equality for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and England. Works well for democracies  such as Australia, the US and Germany.
1/2 Great that Scotland has voted to remain a part of the Union. We now need a new constitutional settlement, a federal UK with equality.
@shirleykay11 @Jamin2g LOL to that.
@Lynnelmer1 not for the first time today I'm saying no!

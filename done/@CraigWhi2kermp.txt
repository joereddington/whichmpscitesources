@micknand @lastbid When we know what it is we are up against then yes will assess what needs to be done.
@micknand @lastbid what the full proposals contain
@micknand @lastbid One part of the strategy without putting everything else in place first. As I say, we wait with 'Baited Breath' to see
@micknand @lastbid What 'meat on the bone' looks like, it's difficult to assess all pros & cons. My blog reflects my view if they do things
@micknand @lastbid Pulling bits out to suit their own argument. The Strategic review is massive and covers many areas. Once we get to see
@micknand @lastbid exactly what it is they are proposing. Once we know that then we know what it is we are up against. So far people are
@micknand @lastbid Not aware we have any affected communities yet. We only have strategic view presented. We need full picture to assess
@lastbid Just me surmising perhaps
@lastbid That with 1st rec. at 14.1 gives us a pretty strong clue as to what the OBC doesn't include. Hence putting the cart b4 the horse
@lastbid True but it does say at 13.5 that they have an 'understanding' of what's in the OBC which would indicate they've been briefed. Tie
@lastbid Not illegal if potentially they are not going to implement??!!! Only my guess, I don't know for sure
@lastbid Sure but in conjunction with article to give it context - see previous tweet for location of article
@lastbid If you go to my website http://t.co/djUaw7NdIj it is posted under 'updates' A&E.
@lastbid Also for the record, I do not have any 'inside' information. I have no more than you do.
@lastbid This to be the case. This is a good indication not a cynical one as your tweet suggests. People might just get what they want!
@lastbid Include worked up costs on all other bits of the strategy and they are trying to 'put cart before horse'. Good that CCG's recognise
@lastbid If you read my last Courier article you may get a clue as to why this is so. I would suspect business plan from NHS Trust does not

@leerf health aspects & what miinor injuries unit in Todmorden looks like. Think the NHS Trust has behaved shockingly & handled it all badly
@leerf absolutely! I think the CCG should bin the proposal & ask the NHS Trust to come back with some proper consultation on the social care
@leerf don't have the direct link but you can get to them via my website http://t.co/djUaw7NdIj :)
@leerf probably the same place she would today! No proposal to close A&E! Read the proposals instead of listening to your lefty pals
@leerf as per usual your lefty mates would have you believe anything! Sheep come to mind!

@SkaPlunk @cllrawilkinson Ah, so now we get down to brass tacks! You really are stretching the truth now! Out of context & out of touch!
@SkaPlunk @cllrawilkinson @cjpearson82 @SowerbyBlue @allott4halifax @Examiner From the Examiner? #patheitic
@cllrawilkinson @SkaPlunk So your misguided accusation is based on this?! #sameoldlabour
@cllrawilkinson @cjpearson82 @SowerbyBlue @allott4halifax @Examiner I've said lots on the subject but your accusation is typical of Labour
@SkaPlunk @cllrawilkinson @cjpearson82 @SowerbyBlue @allott4halifax @Examiner You know that for a fact then?
@SkaPlunk Don't you pertain stand as a Green Candidate?nThen surely you have your finger on pulse & understand politics & what's going on?

@SkaPlunk Your words not mine! Pathetic if you don't understand the politics you pertain to to represent. Look at the facts
@SkaPlunk You don't know the meaning of the word 'facts'!! #laughable
@SkaPlunk @allott4halifax @cllrawilkinson @SowerbyBlue @cjpearson82 @JoshFG As I've said, you just don't understand the minutiae of politics
@SkaPlunk And a fine business it is too! You clearly don't understand the minutiae of politics
@SkaPlunk @allott4halifax @cllrawilkinson @SowerbyBlue @cjpearson82 Get a life!
@SkaPlunk Labours job tax! Welcome to the world of politics Gary where this means dealing with many stalking horses!

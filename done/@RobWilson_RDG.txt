@LordAshcroft that's not going to happen.
@SamCoatesTimes @DAaronovitch it was pretty bad on TV.
The so-called mansion tax will quickly lead to a Council Tax re-evaluation & property taxes will rise for the vast majority. #sameoldLabour
#Labour supporters can be assured that Ed Miliband sealed the deal with the electorate today. Probably not in the way he or they planned.
@afneil shredding @andyburnhammp live on air over figures being used to fund #NHS. It's remarkable that Shad SoS can't explain the finances.
Massive extra taxes coming to a home near you courtesy of labour. Join us to stop them! http://t.co/GEWgX6RfrM
That was prob the worst speech from a Labour leader I've heard for some time. Off the top of my head can't think of a worse one. Can anyone?
Miliband speech is dreadful. Awful, wooden, cringeworthy. Saying 'together' isn't a plan for Govt! Big Govt, class war & anti business.
@gizbourn @ReadingCouncil bad proposal which I do not support. Gathering views to feed back & encouraging people to write to Council.

Labour doubled tax on the lower paid. Now it wants to put min wage up by 25p. Really quite extraordinary when you think about it...
@KateEMcCann partly because the LPC is independent!

In 6 years time, Miliband wants min wage at £8 - up 25p a year. Using a headline figure to hide that you aren't doing much will backfire.
@danieljcross please email me the full details.
2/2 ...just so that Labour can set the min wage level. So take it away from the experts & give it to people who wrecked economy. #Marr #mad
#Marr Ed Miliband says he'll abolish  Low Pay Commission that sets min wage, an independent body representing all parts of economy. 1/2
Miliband minimum wage rise promise a con?4.3% annual increase while BoE says average wages rising 4% by 2017.

@steverichards14 about the same number of Qs as Devolution. Of course it can be delivered, it's an issue of fairness.
Has Ed Balls sen how badly Labour us running the Welsh NHS? http://t.co/5OSIXYywXR
Miliband won't trust UK people re EU Ref 2017 & won't trust the English to run our own affairs. Putting his Party before country again.
@steverichards14 @BBCPM I heard him and he was utterly wrong on almost everything.
Miliband is turning his back on the English by blocking change. It will end badly for his Party if he doesn't change. Appears antiEnglish.
@ianjenner I will do as I said in my tweet. DevoMax is part of a wider settlement for UK including English votes for English MPs. Only fair.

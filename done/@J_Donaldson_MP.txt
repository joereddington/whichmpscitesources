@niall_robb No of course not. It's all in the Budget. Growth of private sector whilst public sector contracts. Why do u advocate more taxes? Sun Feb 22 15:50:45 GMT 2015
@niall_robb @sharon1234welby Happy to add Green Party as advocating water charges. With only one MLA unlikely to succeed in imposing charges Sun Feb 22 14:19:07 GMT 2015
@Johnvernon74 Court budget comes out of block grant NOT rates! Court closure nothing to do with rates. Sun Feb 22 12:03:14 GMT 2015
@sharon1234welby we have blocked water charges here. Only Party advocating them is Alliance Party. Sun Feb 22 12:00:14 GMT 2015
@sharon1234welby Not suggesting it is Sharon. But if you lived elsewhere it would be even higher and if lived in England water charge on top Sun Feb 22 11:50:48 GMT 2015

@chrisadonnelly it's a fair question so don't evade it. If GFA is no longer relevant as u suggest why does SF talk of anti-agreement forces?
@chrisadonnelly so republicans have abandoned the GFA? Their latest statements talk of anti-agreement forces. Which agreement?
@chrisadonnelly @brianjohnspencr so where were they in Strand 1 in 1998? By your definition GFA a product of a childish process! Revisionism

@LVGreens only hogwash is your defence of SDLP decision to block John Lewis at Sprucefield. Why don't u just join them like rest of members?
@LVGreens no wonder your people are defecting to SDLP when all you do is defend SDLP decisions to stop massive investment in Lagan Valley!
@StripyMoggie Because he is Minister directly responsible. He & his predecessor are blocking the investment at Sprucefield. Why defend him?
1,000 jobs at Sprucefield lost. 300 jobs at Coleraine lost. Millions in investment lost. Planning reforms lost. @MarkHDurkan just plain lost

@westbelfasy right minded people don't believe a terrorist who walked into a fish shop with a bomb & murdered 9 innocent people is a victim!
@birdydette no I don't agree with your definition of a victim. We will have to agree to differ.
@birdydette were the IRA shankill bombers also victims? Were the UVF shankill butchers also victims? In my view not. What is your view?
@birdydette then why accuse me of saying she wasn't a victim?

@killultagh Met Ofcom recently re poor mobile coverage in Aghalee & Hillsborough. Roll out of 4G will mean enhanced coverage so should help.
Voted against the Governments Bill on lobbying as it is much too restrictive on Charities and others engaged in legitimate campaigning.
Good day for Parliament. Passionate, informed debate & right outcome. International peace effort needed & prosecute war crimes. #Syria
Hope to take part in debate on Syria in Parliament, Thursday. Any intervention must avoid boots on the ground and risk of civilian losses.

@fireworks577 not sure Joanna.  I will check this out when I am next at the Civic Centre in Lisburn.
If anyone can assist the PSNI with identifying the person responsible for this attack, Lisburn will be a safer place. http://t.co/ocX1nm90Y5
@chefkathymac application for street collections is made to the PSNI. See attached for further information.  http://t.co/sYG2pZNddU
@Andrew_Hopper please keep me informed.  Email is jeffreydonaldsonmp@laganvalley.net
@Andrew_Hopper also depends on whether there have been any conditions applied to a planning permission for the development.
@Andrew_Hopper thanks. If tree had a preservation order then permission required from DOE.  If no such order, then permission not required.
@Andrew_Hopper is this on the Dobbies site at Saintfield Road or in a residential development nearby?
@chefkathymac I think you still need a permit for street collections.
@Unitedprotestan @BBCMarkSimpson I am told that national flag is being carried with flags of all participating countries.
@Waringstown_UUP is this UUP that supported early release of Castlederg Provos from prison and endorsed the listing of the prison buildings?
@General_Vibe Sorry to hear about discrimination and loss of job. Suggest contact MP/MLA and ask them to raise it with Head of Civil Service
@chefkathymac yes,  am already in contact with this family and supporting their quest for funding of this vital cancer treatment.
@Kilsally it is indeed.  A proud moment for that historic borough of Carrickfergus where a previous King William first landed in Ireland.
@marlenewills06 yes, I am told the Union Flag will fly on City Hall to mark the Royal birth.
Congratulations to the Duke & Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their son. A Prince and future King of our United Kingdom is born.

@GWalker9 Thanks Gail for a well reasoned article. Many criticise Christians & forget the excellent work done by churches in every community
@Darren_Black84 Darren, many aspects to the site, including Royal Ulster Agricultural Society. If you provide email I will send details.
@JeffreyPeel enjoyed debate this morning on @StephenNolan. Christianity v Secularism big topic. Suspect we will discuss these issues again.
@killultagh @jamiedlk glad to report that Ofcom have agreed to meet me at Westminster to discuss poor coverage in Aghalee and Hillsborough.
Delighted to support World Autism Day and especially to acknowledge the excellent work of Autism NI - Lisburn Branch.

@declanmurray78 sorry Declan. We differ on that one.  We are better off within the Union.
@declanmurray78 Declan, I am not 'ruled' by the British. I am British. I was born British.  My British citizenship is my birthright.
@declanmurray78 I don't support a united Ireland but accept the right to an aspiration provided it is pursued by peaceful means alone.
@declanmurray78 yes I would.
@declanmurray78 I am saying that those who wish this have the right to their aspiration. It is a matter for the people of the 26 counties.
@declanmurray78 @martinfrankson no more a fantasy than those who aspire to a united Ireland!
@MartinFrankson yes Martin. Rejoining the Commonwealth would be a good first step. A stronger, broader Union would also help Scotland remain
@Chrisryder47 indeed Chris.  We had a civic reception recently in Lisburn to honour these courageous people.
We should also recognise the courage of Army Bomb Disposal experts who risk their lives to prevent murder & destruction by enemies of peace.

@Conor_Devine Am dealing with a number of such cases in my constituency.  Important companies go to their local MP to press for settlement.
“@FalklandsGov: The results of our historic referendum. Yes votes 1513 (99.8%). No votes 3 (0.02%). Turnout 92%. Our people have spoken!”
@stephenjmckenna Stephen, you cannot label the way people vote as a sectarian headcount and then say they are not sectarian. That is twisted
@stephenjmckenna when you label people who vote for a unionist candidate as sectarian then you are engaging in sectarianism.
@stephenjmckenna purpose of unity candidate was to get an MP who will take his seat at Westminster. How is that sectarian?
@stephenjmckenna why is unionism deemed sectarian Stephen?  Is labelling one section of our community in this way helpful? #moteinyourowneye

@BernardMcEldown Think we will agree to differ on this. I wish you well in Labour Party. Good to see more Ulster people involved nationally.
@BernardMcEldown its been there longer than that but I say it's wrong to generalise re politics & religion. It can be a force for good too!
@BernardMcEldown I tweeted about a christian event & you weighed in with allegations of bigotry. Think you have the prejudice problem not me
@BernardMcEldown I think you are being sectarian right now. You should learn to control your bias against unionists. #doublestandards
@BernardMcEldown time you moved on Bernard. Some of us have had to come to terms with a lot more than bigotry. #sectarian murder campaigns
@BernardMcEldown William Wilberforce was a politician & Christian who, inspired by his faith brought an end to slavery. Wrong to generalise.

@LouiseMcDaid happy to sign this EDM in Parliament Louise.
@AlexKane221b I understand First Minister had already decided to call this decision in. John Lewis say they will then reconsider Sprucefield
With John Lewis pulling out, message is NI closed for business. Planning system not fit for purpose and a Minister not fit for his job.
1/2 Decision of John Lewis to withdraw planning application is disaster for NI. Over 1,500 jobs and £100M investment lost in mid recession.

Prime Minister David Cameron addressing Council of Europe. Refreshingly realistic and honest speech. http://t.co/vkld0o9S
@roadracingfan5 Appalled by Duffy verdict. Heart goes out to families of two murdered soldiers. Put thru ordeal of trial for this. Unjust!
@mattgoood.  Congratulations to you and your team on the success of your excellent video on Friends' School.  It is getting great coverage.
@StephenNolan Matt Good twitter is @mattgoood.  Note there are three o's in the good!
@StephenNolan cheers Stephen.  The school will really appreciate seeing their video on your website.
@BBCMarkSimpson thanks for posting the Friends' School video on the BBC Website.  They will be thrilled!
An excellent LipDub promo produced by Friends School, Lisburn highlighting the sense of community in their school. http://t.co/dwOTwtAz
@wecaulfield just listening to James Young 'Behind the Barricades'. Brilliant & timeless humour. Helped get us through some dark days in NI.
@colineurosonic they play Dunmurry Rec which is in my constituency!  Best of luck to Both teams.  Hope it's a good game.
@Teddymcatackney PM must handle carefully. Scots react badly to London dictating. Need nationwide unionist movement to advocate for Union.
@joannajones1 we share your concern. Will be pressing for key changes to Welfare Reform Bill to protect rights of people with disabilities.
@joannajones1 I will check this out Joanna and ask that they comply with equality requirements.  Braille & audio should be available.
Attended Preview of the film 'Iron Lady' on life of Margaret Thatcher. Excellent performance by Meryll Streep. A must see for all politicos.
@finlaycameron Happy to support the re-enactment.  Can you email me some details?  Thanks.
A Happy New Year to all my friends on Twitter/LinkedIn. 2012 is going to be a big year for the UK - lets hope it's a peaceful one.
A very interesting perspective on counter-terrorism and lessons that might be learnt from the experience of Singapore. http://t.co/IEx4rs4F
Had the honour of announcing result of the vote on the DUP Motion on Europe in the House of Commons.  Historic victory for a Unionist Party.
@joannajones1 hope it goes well tomorrow. Let me know if I can help in any way.
@joannajones1 Joanna,  please let me know if I can help with this dreadful situation with Easyjet.
Spent day at Smithwick Inquiry giving evidence concerning alleged Garda collusion in the murders of C Supt Harry Breen & Supt Bob Buchanan.
@Nocuts2011 you said I was implementing cuts. I am an opposition MP. Name cuts I voted for in Parliament? Facts please not anonymous drivel.
@Nocuts2011 I am an opposition MP in Parliament who has voted against cuts.  Best to check facts before you make silly anonymous comments.
@Manwithaview1 there should have been a referendum on the previous EU treaties. If UK sign up to this one then the people must have a say.
@Nocuts2011 look at the picture.  Also, IDS, Owen Paterson and Boris Johnston have each said there should be a referendum on any new Treaty.
Let's hope Mr Cameron follows the lead of 3 wise men and runs from an EU Superstate. The people must be given a vote. http://t.co/HIl80s8C
@robertraineyni lol. What were the results in Lagan Valley - DUP 4 MLA's, TUV 0. Lisburn City Council - DUP 15 Cllrs, TUV 0. Enough said.
@StephenNolan @jim_wells_mla now that would have created a stir on liveTV!
@StephenNolan @jim_wells_mla very partial to raspberry ruffle bars myself.  In moderation of course. You should try bar-sharing with Peter!
@robertraineyni actually it was the people of Lagan Valley who elected me.  They overwhelmingly rejected your kind of negative politics.
@DVATW no one is listening David. The Unionist community has left you behind.
@robertraineyni the same East Belfast that voted him top of the poll THIS year and returned 3 DUP MLA's to Stormont. You are a tiny minority
@DVATW I'll stick to representing the Unionist people, you stick to the obscurity they consigned you to.
@robertraineyni pathetic Robert. Peter Robinson led the DUP to their greatest ever election success this year.  You are in a tiny minority.
@DVATW where there is no vision the people perish. Sums up the visionless  TUV well.  But then you abandoned them after electoral decimation
@hackedoffhack yes, it was an interesting session.  Sammy's imitation Twitter is hilarious.  Almost as humorous as the man himself!
DUP Conference today best ever.  Huge turnout and many excellent contributions by speakers.  Peter Robinson visionary in his speech.
Sorry to hear of the passing of Sean Crummey voice of 'Folks on the Hill'.  Privileged to meet him on a number of occasions. A talented man.
@JohnBoyN1972 I keep an open mind and will listen to all arguments in the debate on capital punishment before coming to a firm view.
@MalachyQuinn so you equate the taking of life, after due process, of a mass murderer with the killing of a defenceless unborn child?
@MalachyQuinn we have only called for a debate, the first in over 20 years. Why object to a reasoned debate on an issue of public interest?
@Mr_C_Ardill I accept that, just find it disappointing that the gesture made by M Ritchie to wear a poppy isn't replicated by the new leader
@StripyMoggie I am exercising my freedom of opinion as well. The Poppy is not a sectarian symbol in Flanders or Northern Ireland.
@NeilMcNickle when you're Party Leader and your predecessor wore a Poppy it is more than a personal preference. It is a political statement.
The decision by Alastair McDonnell not to wear a Poppy on Remembrance Sunday shows disrespect. He is leading the SDLP back not forward.
@neilmartin12 Try telling that to thousands of Christians who face daily persecution across the world. They are denied even basic rights.
On Monday I will be in Parliament to vote for a referendum on our relationship with the EU.  Time the people of this country had a say.
@Adammcguk  In Parliament, I will be voting in favour of a referendum on our membership of the EU. Time for the people to have their say.
Members of the Armed Forces killed on operational duty in the service of our country ought to be included in the Military Honours List.
@HMAKabul I share your condemnation and we in Northern Ireland stand ready to help build that stability if called upon to assist.
@Clairsi I will ask the local Councillors to raise this with Lisburn Council and get it cleaned up as soon as possible. Jeffrey
@NeilMcNickle they should be made to pay for the damage they have caused.
@ConallMcD not quite true Conall.  Parliament was recalled after the Omagh bomb in August 1998.
Challenged Secretary of State for Defence in the House of Commons on reduction in army numbers in Northern Ireland and impact on security.
Three cheers for Darren Clarke.  A fantastic victory as another Ulsterman wins again.
Its the 12th July and I am walking in Aghalee today with my fellow Orange brethren.  Hope its a good day for everyone and passes peacefully.
Attended a Parliamentary Reception to honour local soldiers including the RIR & Irish Guards returning from Afghanistan http://t.co/2pcrXRP
A truth commission in Northern Ireland is no substitute for justice for the innocent victims.  There can be no amnesty for terrorist crimes.
Visiting Plymouth to see the medical and rehabilitation facilities for Royal Navy and Marines personnel recovering from combat injuries.
In Parliament today to hear President Obama. Disappointing first term - taking out the Bin (Laden) the high point. Needs to start leading.
@tomthehatchet I couldn't vote for the UK - some new rule - but hope they win.
Azerbaijan get my vote for Eurovision followed closely by Hungary.
BBC News - Talks over military covenant legal status - http://bbc.in/ikTNCC
@robertraineyni I will pass that on to the candidates.  Driving home this evening I see most parties in Lisburn need to take them down.
@Neilmc28 Thanks Neill. I hope you will keep involved in local politics and that our two parties can find ways to work more closely together
In Defence Select Committee hearing Chiefs of Army, Navy & RAF. Earlier met group of disabled people from NI lobbying against DLA changes
@paulmccrum Yes Paul it does.  We are reducing from 18 down to 16 seats in Parliament representing Northern Ireland.
@germanloyalists I think Tom is more TUV than moderate unionist.  His stance is contradictory. UUP let IRA out of jail then call them 'scum'
Arrived in Paris for final meeting of European Security & Defence Assembly tomorrow. Interesting to hear other perspectives post Bin Laden.

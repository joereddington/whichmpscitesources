@Lucycaulfield I do not expect there to be a majority to overturn the Act in the next Parliament, but in any case I would not support this. Thu Apr 23 13:13:52 BST 2015
@Lucycaulfield I hope it was just a mistake on their part. I have strong views on animal welfare. Thu Apr 23 13:04:00 BST 2015

@Lucycaulfield I do not believe that animals should be subject to cruel treatment, so I would not support the repealing of the Hunting Act. Thu Apr 23 12:59:44 BST 2015
@Lucycaulfield That particular website is completely inaccurate. I do not support repealing the Hunting Act. Thu Apr 23 12:58:05 BST 2015

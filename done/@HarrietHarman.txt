@drama_holly @RoundhouseLDN yes pl email your response to the questions. I look forward to hearing from you
@MsAlliance @OperaCreep @RoyalOperaHouse that's why schools so important and why ofsted need to check and report on arts
@KevinBrennanMP makes powerful case for @UKLabour commitment to arts & culture in schools
Many thanks @RoundhouseLDN -packed gathering, great discussion http://t.co/t7JErQHycS
@clemencybh @SamBeckerMusic @chiggi saying they can do more. Not that they don't!
@clemencybh @SamBeckerMusic @chiggi but don't you believe that they can do more to include? And ensure public know arts ARE for all?
@SamBeckerMusic @chiggi v true. And role for ofsted to ensure schools take up local arts opportunities
@BikesNBukes I don't say should show value for money. But must b inclusive
@BikesNBukes agreed
@SamBeckerMusic @chiggi public need to know about the good things they're doing
@apomd @allanbeavis @NickyBenedetti not a "pop" at the proms. But can't we get more diverse audience, more inclusion?
@BikesNBukes absolutely not telling people what art they should make. Saying all children should get the benefit of our great arts.
@BikesNBukes but taxes should find the arts. So important to have public support.

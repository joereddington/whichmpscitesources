Delighted to see new lift open in Dawlish Manor House. All levels of this wonderful building now accessible to all. http://t.co/NkYSGXdq1D
Dawlish line today- some speed restrictions, important to note it is open as usual. @networkrail @FGW doing great job http://t.co/me4ZBND22K
@nesscottage @michaelclayson assured by NR yesterday's damage v.minor & no risk to service. Important to keep things in perspective.
@bankofengland confirms that wage growth set to outstrip inflation by 2.1% in 2015, meaning people will feel better off.
I want to thank the local @NewtonAbbotJCP staff - 1.3% unemployment shows what a great job they do @Mark_J_Harper
Delighted that unemployment in my constituency fell again last month & now stands at 1.3%. One of the best in the whole UK #Conservatives
Today's cartoon in @Telegraph aptly sums up many feelings about the European Arrest Warrant vote this week. http://t.co/jq0ay9WPv8
Pleased to hear Labour giving Opposition Day to #EAW next week. I will be there to vote against transferring further powers to Europe.
I was unable to support the Government last night on European Arrest Warrant. The whole issue needs proper debate followed by specific vote.
.@BBCAnyQuestions are at @hannahstudios at Seale Hayne in my constituency  tonight. Hoping for a strong @Conservatives showing! 8pm, Radio 4
This morning I questioned Iain Duncan Smith about positive employment figures at the @CommonsWorkPen Select Committee http://t.co/0h0yjlLju3
Delighted that the Prime Minister @David_Cameron mentions the Kingskerswell Bypass at #PMQs today. A vital relief road for all residents.
A lovely video of the opening of Clay Pits Way in Kingsteignton yesterday.Good news for the community https://t.co/unbYXJiVgs
This morning I've been sitting on the Small Business Bill Committee, looking at ways to support our brilliant small and micro businesses.

Local Teignbridge MP @AMMorrisMP prepares to open the new B3193 this morning #Devon http://t.co/FEGxNsdwmG
Magnificent sight - huge crowds at Tower of London at weekend to see poppies. Makes you very proud of this country. http://t.co/q5ODaG7nLe
Great to be working alongside my West Country neighbour @sheryllmurray on Small Business Bill Committee - she is real champion for Cornwall
Just had amendment to Small Biz Bill passed with my good colleague @sheryllmurray - cutting red tape for our small family breweries #Devon
Huge post bag on #Recall this week - many thanks for all of the supportive comments on my speech. Battle lost, but campaign continues !
Bitterly disappointing news that the Lib Dems have blocked @neill_bob EU Referendum Bill. Clegg & Co think they know better than the voters.
Pleased to see Jobcentre+ introducing "Genuine Prospect Of Work" test for EU migrants wishing to claim benefits from 10 Nov. Long overdue.
Amazing- 166 MPs voted in favour of genuine #Recall last night - but less than 5% of Lib Dem Parliamentary Party supported it #AnotherUturn
Many great speeches in #Recall Bill debate last night incl @ZacGoldsmith @NadineDorriesMP - Labour payroll out in force to block reform.
Speaking #Recall Bill debate last night - our amendments trusting voters defeated 166-340. Not Labour's finest hour. http://t.co/RJtkoV7eOE
Really disappointed to hear that Labour might be whipping its front bench today to block real #Recall @ZacGoldsmith @hoeykateMP
Out canvassing in Teignmouth on Saturday with the lovely @CarolineElsom & friends. Very encouraging responses. http://t.co/vF9lvqrQFK
Lib Dems completely absent from the airwaves in last 48 hours on 1.7 billion EU "SuccessTax" for UK taxpayer.
I will be speaking in the House tomorrow to support the amendment to #Recall in my name & colleagues incl @ZacGoldsmith @hoeykateMP
In this week's @mdaupdates I write about the importance of the #RecallBill. Vital that MPs trust the electorate ...who put trust in them.
Incredible that EU wants to impose a 1.7bn "Success Tax" on UK economy while giving a substantial rebate to others incl France #OutofTouch
@AndyPena @KellyJS @NigelCulkin @stujbanderson It applies to all 4 of you. Great to work with you. Next APPG Micros mtg in House on 28 Jan
Astounding that the out- of- touch EU now presents UK taxpayer with a new 1.7bn Euro bill - they want to tax us for our economic success.
Great to catch up with @AndyPena at the House of Commons yesterday - a real  advocate & champion of Entrepreneur Education in the UK.
Pleased @networkrail has announced plans to prevent flooding at Cowley & Stafford bridges in Exeter - will have big impact on train service
I am sitting on the Small Business Bill Committee today, looking at ways that Govt plans to support our much valued SMEs and micros.
Well done to my good colleague @ChrisPincher -he will be a vital link between backbenchers & Exec in his new role on 1922 Committee.
@Kevin_Maguire Thats right - the trains were never late in the British Rail days #pieinsky
Looking forward to joining huge #Conservative team in #Rochester & Strood next week - two excellent candidates @anna_firth & @KellyTolhurst

I am speaking with @MegMunn01 this afternoon at the Female Quotient International Conference @pinkshoeclub #fq getting women into business
@PurnL I have asked FGW for a response.
I was right behind Conservative colleague Bob Neill in more ways than one today - just voted for EU Referendum Bill http://t.co/dHwMhKGfmo
Lib Dems 'claim' that they want to give the British people a say on Europe - here is the reality in today's EU debate http://t.co/xtfrEmbTcn
Wonderful speech from @neill_bob - all time classic put down for Labour filibuster @MikeGapes
Absolutely staggering that there is only ONE Lib Dem MP in the House today for the EU Referendum Bill - Clegg & Co won't trust the people.
@grahamstuart And the Lib Dems
@nesscottage Read the full transcript of Lord Freud's comments & the context. He said nothing of the sort.
Must see TV @bbcquestiontime - Labour's @angelaeagle jeered & heckled after mudslinging at Lord Freud @IsabelOakeshott @Jeremy_Hunt
Hundreds of Conservative MPs in the House this morning to support @neill_bob & give British people a long overdue EU Referendum.
@Robbill123 @thetimes It is not "UKIP space". It is space that 99% of Conservatives have occupied since at least 1989. #BrugesSpeech
Silly article from Peter Oborne in @Telegraph - he is highlighting divisions which don't exist & harking back to a Tory Party era pre Heath!
Interesting @thetimes - uncontrolled, low skill immigration is a huge concern of my constituents & EU is blocking our ability to control it
Does the early retirement of @JeremyBrowneMP today indicate that the Lib Dems are poised to move to the Left in 2015 #yes
Sat on DWP Committee today, attended South West MPs meeting with Transport Secretary and APPG Women in Business. Varied & interesting day!
Lord Freud made mistake, but I know from my work on DWP Committee that he is a good man who works in Govt for free to give to public service
Gordon Brown seemingly unaware that he can vote on matters affecting my Devon constituents, but I can't vote on many matters affecting his
Biggest red herring in politics from Labour MPs claiming English Votes on English laws will "create 2 classes of MP" - we have that now!
I am sitting on the Small Business Bill Committee this week - looking at ways we can support & boost SMEs & micros - the lifeblood of UKPLC
Looking forward to voting in the House next week for an EU Referendum Bill along with 300 Conservative colleagues & @neill_bob
Excellent article @MailOnline from @SimonDanczuk -hits nail on head on immigration. Always amazed he does not sit on Labour front bench.
Labour politicians now waking up to consequences of uncontrolled immigration but 2.5m net immigration on their watch 2003-10 #horsebolted
Dozens of opinions in the Sundays today but not seen anyone denying basic truth - only #Conservatives capable of delivering EU Referendum
This morning I am speaking on the panel @fsb_policy Rural Conference @DevonCountyShow
Labour spent the 80s telling the electorate they were wrong & it did them no good. Time to listen & refine the message #ClactonByElection
Top class National Hunt racing & prize money @NewtonAbbotRace today. Well done to all concerned. Please support our fantastic local course.
Silly & hyperbolic speech by @vincecable today - if he hates the Government so much, why does he stay in it ?
Spectacular aerial view of Shaldon and Teignmouth in my beautiful constituency last week. #devon http://t.co/z3WTxRKymW
Thought @nick_clegg sounded petulant & angry @BBCr4today - all over place on EU Referendum & confirming Lib Dem a wasted vote on EU Reform
Local MP @AMMorrisMP  fishing for votes outside the Crab Shack in Teignmouth today. http://t.co/eIr4VykoUT
Local MP @AMMorrisMP unveils new community defibrillator in Teignmouth this morning. http://t.co/Itkj3Z74ko
@SixVpf which is precisely why, as Chris Grayling said, we have the best British judges in the world in British courts.
Interesting to see the hostility mention of reform of #ECHR attracts from @BBCNews  & Liberal left Islington lawyers. #OutofTouch
Justice Sec Chris Grayling excellent on @BBCr4today - #ECHR now imposing in too many areas of British life where not originally intended.
Interesting @BBCNews using phrase 'threat to ECHR' .....they are out of touch with vast majority who want laws decided in UK courts.
Delighted Chris Grayling looking hard at flawed #ECHR - British law, made in British Parlament, imposed by British judges in British courts
Huge well done to Newton Abbot company Centek Ltd - just won the Queen's Award for Enterprise @bisgovuk
@nesscottage @teignroy Disagree. Figure represents 3% of total Govt spending. Still plenty of savings to be made. Right to reward strivers.
Particularly liked Cameron's "I will not take no for an answer" on EU reform - there you have institution that needs to hear a lot of "No's"
A serious speech from David Cameron today. In two horse race, the contrast with Miliband is stark. Reminiscent of Thatcher v Kinnock in 87.
@LabourDave93 client welfare state vastly extended via Tax Credits to subsidise employment - Brown was Labour Chancellor at time.
Common sense measures from IDS today incl further welfare cap & pre paid benefit cards. Welfare should be safety net, not lifestyle choice
Racing today @NewtonAbbotRace - please support our fantastic local racecourse.
Fully agree with @OwenPatersonMP ON @BBCr4today - imperative that there is no thoughless criticism of Conservatives currently disaffected.
@margotjamesmp  Hague is a huge asset to the Party & we need to. Make good use of him !
@MarkReckless must understand that choice is Cameron- EU Referendum or Miliband/Clegg- No EU Referendum. There is no 3rd option on EU future
@PRSD it is nonsense.
Excellent article from my colleague David Davis in today's @MailOnline. Conservative family must unite as alternative is Miliband in No.10
"Most of us forget the car keys, @EdMiliband_MP forgot about the £75 billion deficit" - Hague at his best on @BBCAnyQuestions
Very impressed with @WilliamJHague on @BBCAnyQuestions last night....knowledgable and humorous - huge asset to the Conservative Party!
@nesscottage many, many more innocents incl British lives are at risk if ISIL not destroyed. Real threat to mainland UK, not just overseas
Heading to Birmingham today for Party Conference. Last week has shown choice in 7 months time is stark - Cameron or Miliband. No 3rd option.
Inspiring and moving interview with @sajidjavid in today's @DailyMailUK - he is a huge credit to both Party & country #Conservatives
I have just voted to support British air strikes against ISIL in Iraq. 
God Speed and Safe Passage to our Royal Air Force.
Thanks to the many constituents who have contacted me about the vote on airstrikes today. I attach the motion below. http://t.co/xYzEG9FdGb
Perhaps @Ed_Miliband should try an autocue next time he makes a speech...every little helps... http://t.co/VFOqjwrMcF
@DavidJonesMP quite a few.....Darling, Brown, Healey, Jenkins ....
Voters on doorstep have two main concerns at moment - economy, and immigration. Yesterday @Ed_Miliband spoke for an hour...mentioned neither
Devastating verdict on @Ed_Miliband speech from centre-Left commentariat @JohnRentoul @DPJHodges.
@darrencowell @JohnRentoul There was no substance Darren. Just a tick box exercise speech & full of trite cliches.
Thoughts on @Ed_Miliband speech - long on cliches & analysis but bereft of real content & policies. Not a future Prime Minister.
'Bankers. Oligarchs. Mansions. Surfing'. @Ed_Miliband talking to the Labour Party, not the hard working people of this country.
Labour could fill their £18.5bn spending black hole with a "Wooden Cliches Tax". This speech by @Ed_Miliband would cover most of it.
Poor speech by @Ed_Miliband - back to the 1970s and the politics of envy & grievance.
Wise words from @hoeykateMP - Labour's Constitutional Convention little more than a 3 year long Waffle Shop which won't sort English issue.
@SharonBowlesUK @HouseofTwits @LibDems ....but unfairness to England has been greatly increased since Labour set up Scots Parliament in 1999
Now Chequers summit has taken place, it would be helpful to know @LibDems policy on English MPs only voting on English matters. #justsaying
Had a good catch up with our local Teignbridge police earlier - they do a great & much appreciated job for our local community.
In this weeks column @mdaupdates I write about the importance of amending the Barnett formula and finally sorting  West Lothian Question
I enjoyed attending the Abfest @Fermoys yesterday - a great Teignbridge event with over 100 local ales, cheeses & preserves on offer. #Devon
Heard @edballsmp on @BBCr4today talking about dangers of 'creating 2 classes of MP' - we have that already! Scots MPs vote on Devon issues
Today's poll in @mailonsundaySTL shows only 5% think constitutional reform biggest priority for Govt.
Surely voters will see through Miliband's offer of Constitutional Convention after election - cynical attempt to kick issue into long grass
.@andrewpercy & @Owen_PatersonMP - agree with your comments on #WATO - my overnight constituency mail bag suggests English want fairer deal.
Is @vincecable speaking for Lib Dems on English MPs only voting on English matters? Almost Miliband-like in his vagueness on @SkyNews
@BBCNormanS Will the BBC be showing a Conservative spokesman at some stage ?
The Conservatives polled 411,000 votes in Scotland in 2010 - how predictable that @BBCNews is all about the Labour Party today #Nobalance
Sad but predictable that @BBCNews coverage is all about Gordon Brown's 'heroic role' - yet no mention of brilliant @RuthDavidsonMSP
National Hunt racing this afternoon @NewtonAbbotRace - please support our fantastic local racecourse.
Post referendum - English MPs only voting on English matters throws up a big challenge to the Lib Dems - 20% of their MPs are Scots
Agree with colleague @bernardjenkin & @AndrewRosindell on @BBCr4today - time for proper consultation reflecting views of English & their MPs
Colleague @claire4devizes right on 'devo max' - policy not thought through & is concerning many of my constituents who feel it is unfair.
£1.75m Coastal Communities Grant for Teignmouth theatre secured by local MP @AMMorrisMP - great to see @sajidjavid http://t.co/Sery3toikh

Unemployment in Newton Abbot down a staggering 46% in the last year - proof that the #Conservatives are clearing up the mess Labour left us.

Teignmouth beach in my beautiful constituency last night - who needs the South of France ?#Devon http://t.co/B3vL1tV3fc
I have written in @mdaupdates column this week about how West Lothian Question must be addressed if Scots vote 'No' & get 'devo max' powers.
@nesscottage I hope Scots vote to stay in Union. If they do & we get 'devo max', clearly the West Lothian question will need urgent look
Busy constituency weekend, incl Newton Abbot Cheese & Onion Fayre, RAF Teignmouth wreath ceremony, and watching @DevonAllWhites

BIS Minister @NickBolesMP absolutely right to emphasise importance of high standards & rigour in apprenticeships - very reassuring !
BIS Secretary reminds MPs that the @RBSGroup balance sheet is ten times larger than the entire Scots economy #bettertogether
Well done to my colleague @RichardGrahamMP for highlighting menace of late payment - an issue my APPG Microbusiness has frequently raised.
Good meeting with senior management @networkrail to discuss issues in #Dawlish and South West. Will update in my @TQHeraldExpress column
Pleased to see @TourofBritain pass through my constituency today - big crowds expected so watch the traffic in our country lanes !
Brilliant work by @ZacGoldsmith on leading MP's committee looking at ways of improving the #RecallBill.

Good to read in the national press today top jockey @BarryGeraghty very complimentary about our @NewtonAbbotRace.
Visited Highweek Primary School in my constituency at lunch time to speak with staff & pupils. http://t.co/Gk8bS93u84
Strange headline in today's @guardian "Lib Dems expand criticism of Govt welfare policies" - would these be the same ones they voted for ?

Disturbing scenes on @BBCNews of Russian separatist fighters moving towards key strategic port of Mariupol #Truce?
Article by Matthew Parris in @thetimes was a useful pointer for all Conservatives on precisely how not to fight the General Election.
Would find it sad if our much valued Scots friends, family members & workers needed a passport from 2016 to visit Devon #bettertogether
Huge respect for @jimmurphymp & other Scots MPs who are passionately making the case not to reject a deep 300 year old bond #bettertogether
Thousands of Scots live, visit and work in Devon - & very welcome they are, too #bettertogether
.@CAMRA_Official stopping off in my constituency in #Dawlish this weekend to sample the delicious local beer #Devon
I can't help thinking that the Tweets from @vincecable & other Lib Dems on voting with Labour yesterday were extremely ill advised.
This weekend I will be supporting the Campaign for Real Ale as they stop off in Dawlish on their annual pilgrimage !
My colleague @RichardGrahamMP points out the absurdity of the Labour Party's double standards over the private & public housing sector
Welfare Reform "will reduce social housing waiting list" said Clegg 9 mths ago - @AndrewGeorgeLD why have Lib Dem done U turn in election yr
Well said @SarahNewtonMP - Lib Dems up to old tricks trying to claim a monopoly on compassion
.@Mark_J_Harper points out to @AndrewGeorgeLD that Lib Dem U turn on Welfare Reform will prompt huge rise in public spending #irresponsible
House sitting today to discuss @AndrewGeorgeLD  Bill- what was it about Election Year that has prompted Lib Dem U turn on welfare reforms ?
Sound common sense from @EdwardLeighMP - cruelty to animals abhorrent, but over 100 years of legislation already in place to protect them.
Good article from @JGForsyth in today's @spectator
Excellent #PMQ from @HackneyAbbott on Rotherham  & highly paid officials retaining their jobs after scandal.
Good to see my dear colleague @desmondswayne make a seamless transition from the Whips office to DFID today #impressiveperformance

Moving interview @BBCNews with the parents of Ashya King - the authorities in this case incl @HantsPolice have handled matters very badly
Two months ago I called in the House for Russia to be stripped of the 2018 World Cup - today's @FT reveals discussions are underway.
@AlexanderHDH my colleague Sarah Wollaston in South Hams is your constituency MP.
Constituents asking my view on #AshaKing case -  the official response has been far too heavy handed. Common sense now-reunite with parents
@DevonBloke I think it is outrageous. Time for common sense to prevail, and for this poor child to be reunited with his loving parents.
Hugely impressive debut at the despatch box by @priti4witham in #Treasury Questions #Conservatives
Good to see two outstanding female Conservative MPs answering Treasury Questions now @priti4witham & @andrealeadsom

Very impressive debut at #DWP Questions by new minister @Mark_J_Harper - good to see he is already on top of his new brief.
@chelsea_westie I cannot support this motion. Current legislation is adequate & already gives LA's substantial powers to enter & inspect.
@MsAmberStevens Breeding & Sale of Dogs Act already gives local authorities substantial powers to enter & inspect licensed dog premises.
@RebeccaWoolnoug @chelsea_westie @SusieBSchnauzer @pupaid @sunnybanc
No, won't support. Local authorities currently have adequate powers
My colleague @ZacGoldsmith dead right on @DouglasCarswell - no circular firing squad, just logical policies on EU & promises we deliver.
In reply to constituent's Tweets - I feel @DouglasCarswell should have stayed put - only Conservatives can & will deliver an EU referendum
Good stuff from @bernardjenkin on #WATO - "the Conservative Party belongs to the Euro Sceptics" - & in tune with huge majority of voters too
Regarding @DouglasCarswell - EU should be about peace & trade, but many Conservatives including me now want vast repatriation of powers.
Impressed by @timloughton @JohnMannMP @SarahChampionMP & Damien Green MP - all balanced & fair in media in speaking out on Rotherham
Important to remember that a free press @thetimes Andrew Norfolk at the forefront of exposing the wrongdoing in Rotherham.
Well done to @sajidjavid - common sense benefit reform a key part of getting UK economy back on track #Conservatives

@greggmcclymont
@Rubber_Gub @scottrussell78 end of nov the deadline.
@scottrussell78 yes it's a rapid process indeed.
@scottrussell78 smith due to report next week. So unless you know something I don't about a snap election...
@JamesMoore1998 @scottishlabour sad that you want a Tory govt next year.
@JamesMoore1998 @scottishlabour if you want another Tory govt go right ahead. But most Scots don't.
Overwhelming support for @jimmurphymp & @kdugdalemsp at @CKLabourParty nomination meeting tonight.
@henryhtapper think you've got your nos and yesses wrong way round!
@henryhtapper welcome to Cumbernauld.
@TMW2N cheers.
@TMW2N flu has claimed me.
@Glitzy_Nailz thanks!
@Glitzy_Nailz of course gregg.mcclymont.mp@parliament.uk
@scotgov @agasmith @DerekMackayMSP any money for Cumbernauld town centre?
@MoneyWeek @MerrynSW Labour proposes extending to fund managers legal duty to always put savers interest first. I think @JohnKayFT agrees.
Big congrats to @CumbernauldU on winning the Euroscot League Cup. #kennydalglishsoldteam
@StackpoolArthur and the knights ain't a small hall either.
@euanmccolm ye wirnae at my house.
@saint_lucys my pleasure.
@JosephineCumbo @pensionschamp @JohnRalfe1 expected Minister to be able to answer all questions pertaining to his Bill. Not a great ask.
@JosephineCumbo @JohnRalfe1 indeed. Demand that witnesses do the job of DWP/Treasury and fill in the huge blanks was peculiar.
@GMasterton true that!
A mighty #Cumbernauld tree could be Scotland's finest timber. Vote here to make it so: http://t.co/exDoCCJJou #barkuptherighttree
Apparently its oppositions fault Govt can't explain its own policy on tax avoidance consequences. #pensions
@JosephineCumbo where is the government behavioural analysis? in its absence sounds like wing and a prayer government
@JosephineCumbo nothing impossible. But balance of existing evidence heavily in favour of trust said Chris Curry under questioning.
@Neileo1 @NewsandChron @CumbernauldPCS and why not? It was  about jobs!
@Neileo1 @NewsandChron @CumbernauldPCS to protect those 1400 UK Govt jobs means first staying in UK. Which happily Scots chose to do.
@Neileo1 @NewsandChron @CumbernauldPCS 1400 jobs. As I understand it, 18 job losses. That's 18 too many. But fact remains a fact.
@Neileo1 @NewsandChron Cumbernauld's 1400 UK Gov tax office jobs crucial to local economy. By far biggest local employer.
@JosephineCumbo and if I heard correctly that the committees are advisory not governing...
Behind Private Equity’s Curtain http://t.co/hUGZxgkEnw> more hidden pensions costs & charges this time in USA
@PensionsMonkey cheers Tom.
@JananGanesh @jreedmp inflammable means flammable? What a country!
Heading to @NAPFnews annual conference in Liverpool where I'm speaking this afternoon. Quite a lot to discuss. #pensions #understatement
@RayVay pretty much same as you. Rehash which brought home necessity of substantial checks & balances & answers to legitimate qs.
@JakeMcCafferty aye
@JakeMcCafferty no it didn't.
@DavidWatts23 @SadiqKhan @WilliamJHague finest debater maybe. Finest historian maybe not.
@ChrisGiles_ @stevewebb1 last Labour Govt's pension credit transformative for pensioners most in need.
@NatashaBrownePP would be my pleasure. Contact alan.gillam@parliament.co.uk
@drgmlennox out of the firing line now. We hope:)
@JosephineCumbo we're ok.

@paucoyle @LabourDWP I did.
@stovies5 @LabourDWP bonus tax
@BaggioRinaldi67 I sided with the Scottish people.
@JoannaPollock I was aiming for droll.
“@Rosiescotland12: @greggmcclymont advance warning your P45 will be given in May 2015”> thoughtful of you.
@Torcuil did wonder how long a generation lasts...
@GerryBraiden @AbrachHutchison cheers.
@GerryBraiden @AbrachHutchison do these tallies include postal votes?
@elliotscott94 they're wrong.
@JosephineCumbo the relief is political - I believe in scotland and the UK as a multinational family of nations.
@henryhtapper I'm pleased for scotland and our friends, neighbours and partners across this island:)
“@guardian_clark: 61-39 No in E Dumbartonshire. polls starting to look a bit kind to yes?”> hope you enjoyed your kirkintilloch visit Tom.

@MagiGibson @stephenkb @chrisdeerin quaint and reasonable:) the problem is Magi, nationalism is neither.
@MagiGibson @stephenkb @chrisdeerin a quaint notion of what constitutes an insult Magi.
@MagiGibson @stephenkb @chrisdeerin open your eyes.
@ianssmart @zsstevens yep they despise Westminster except when insisting it will pay Scots pensions & contra own white paper.
@BaggingScotland @amolrajan hope you're right. My experience more mixed.
@paucoyle @UK_Together not unless Alex Salmond decides to.
@kennethmac2000 @KennyFarq no they don't.
@thoughtland @KennyFarq England is already pluralist. Your conceit that breaking up UK encourages pluralism is just that. Conceit.
@kennethmac2000 @KennyFarq Britain is a multinational association from which you wish Scotland to secede. That's literally nationalism.
@KennyFarq that's nationalism for you.
@euanmccolm who knew!

@thoughtland @KevinMcKenna63 hardly. The facts of Hardie's life's work are clear. All else is projection.
@thoughtland @KevinMcKenna63 founding principle of Labour is solidarity of working ppl across UK. Why Hardie sat for West Ham then Merthyr.
@petedoc81 aye.
Memo to my cybernats friends: seceding from a multinational state to form a national one is literally nationalism.
@bbcnickrobinson @ICMResearch in this debate Westminster also code for England. That's what nationalism does.
@MalcolmChishol1 nationalism.
@johnbremner_ @JoeJFagan @Channel4News they have given answers: no currency union with a foreign country.
@lenny_benassi the answer is in
your question.
@paullewismoney @BBCRadio4 hope this time you don't have an SNPer on who doesn't understand pensions.
@iankmsmith @JosephineCumbo time to set NEST free. Now!
@iainmartin1 he was incredible in Kilmarnock yesterday morning. Range and power.
@BaggingScotland that's true. But the only fact we know is that his life's work was building UK Labour. All else is projection.
@BaggingScotland. Hardie's life's work was building UK Labour. What don't you understand about that fact?
@BaggingScotland times are indeed different. But Keir Hardie believed in the UK. That's what we know. All else is guessing.
@Herald_Editor hilarious. Keir Hardie proud Scot who represented people of London then Wales in the UK Parliament. Because he believed in UK
@thoughtland @KennyFarq it is when to do so you break up a successful multinational one.
@myindyscotland try reading not sloganising.
The austerity that a Yes vote would bring down on us all:

Pension fear if Scots vote yes (via @daily_express) http://t.co/K6O7qKEdUT
@heedbaw no I'm trying to point out that HQ moves by banks and insurers  means less tax raised in scotland.
@heedbaw indeed.
@heedbaw it's where HQ is which matters increasingly for tax purposes - thus furore over amazon (Luxembourg) Google (Ireland)
@heedbaw who knows? It certainly means less tax raised in scotland from corporations and thus less to spend on NHS.
@heedbaw it's the assets that matter which is why banks and insurance companies moving HQs south. At 1252% of GDP they need Bank of England.
Scottish independence: Gordon Brown attacks SNP claims over NHS http://t.co/x7peLSF6Cd
@DelboyDerekB this makes me laugh. Scare story for yes = a question it doesn't know the answer to.
@AndrewThorpe4 @faisalislam with Scottish financial sector 1252% of GDP, Scottish banks/insurers need central bank. Salmond's bluff called.
@DavieSbutchy @davidschneider they have indeed.
@davidschneider @DavieSbutchy standard life is not a bank and neither is Scottish widows.

@GerryHassan financial services assets 1252% of Scottish GDP.  Creating a border has economic consequences which are now becoming real.
@debs_debbie851 thanks Debs:)
@Neileo1 @jreedmp he's loving it and was in...Westfield tonight.
@Neileo1 @Ed_Miliband @UK_Together @NewsandChron @scottishlabour the people were indeed "real".
Sir Ian Wood versus some guy making it up as he goes along. #potentiallymaybe
Really worried about losing Scotland's great historic pensions and insurance companies. We need those jobs. #standardlife #scottishwidows

@CKLabourParty team in Cumbernauld tonight with help too from @jreedmp @Jhoeriksen et al. #nothanks #indyref http://t.co/Lr6w1gZbJv
@mowatb only Scottish Labour does socialism. Gordon Brown's pensions and tax credits redistributed £100s of billions from rich to the rest.
@mowatb Irish nationalists thought that too. And yet Labour has never won an Irish election...after 92 years.
Thanks to @rhonddageekie @jreedmp & Cllr MacDonald who joined me in Twechar last night. #nothanks #LabourNo #indyref http://t.co/QBNjF1iMYy
@Rokewood @afneil indeed.
@jfpenman @AlisonIHardie @jmullinjourno @jreedmp absolutely; with the awards to match.
@JohnRalfe1 @thomasselby @PaulineSkypala @stevewebb1 mmm Steve used say EU law prevented removal...
@MuirMurdoch @davidschneider eh? Was stating a fact not expressing an opinion.
@thepfd @CKLabourParty spoke to 1300 ppl face to face at weekend. And out every day since too. No doubt it's tight. Huge decision. #nothanks
@MekQuarrie @jessbrammar that's why there is no such thing as a European nationalist either. UK is a state of several nations.
@MekQuarrie @jessbrammar Britain is a multinational association of different nations. That's what's at stake.
@deletedbyMPs @Daily_Record why do you i have deleted tweets when I haven't?

So sorry to hear about death of my colleague Jim Dobbin. A lovely man.
@sosolidshoe @davidschneider more nationalist sweet reason.
@stirlingsheep yes can lower income tax.
@mowatb @PeterAdamSmith that's some logic.
@DavieSbutchy @lenny_benassi there would be a border. For the first time in 300 years. Sadly.
@lenny_benassi thanks very much.
@petermacmahon @EdMiliband_MP only have to read what he said. As opposed to headline.
@holyroodmandy @petermacmahon @EdMiliband_MP that's a fact.
@jpconne indeed.
@jpconne but not accurate. As even a casual glance at what EM actually said confirm.
@PeterAdamSmith not your fault has become the norm.
@mowatb @PeterAdamSmith google it.
@PeterAdamSmith I'm pointing out that you quote is from headline writer not EM.
@PaulBisland @holyroodmandy he didn't say it. Headline writer did.
@PeterAdamSmith @pault1888 but Ed didn't actually say that. The headline writer did.
@JeremyCliffe agree.
@JeremyCliffe campaign websites not a reliable source for quantitative canvassing assessment.
@Chris72600702 @davidschneider a whole 2 hrs? How dare I go out and speaking to constituents...
@davidschneider the Scotland Act which I voted for in 2011 means Scottish Parliament sets a Scottish rate of income tax from 2016.
@davidschneider do you not know that there will be a Scottish rate of income tax set by Holyrood from 2016? Not a promise. A fact.
#nothanks stall on a sunny Kilsyth Main St. Great response. http://t.co/DITNArB60O
@bobbynoodles no crystal ball but you could be sure SNP would be emboldened by nationalism's victory.
@Markfergusonuk inevitable sadly wherever nationalism emerges.
@Markfergusonuk that's nationalism. Sadly.
@joncraig he made an optimistic case for continuing the UK.
@DAaronovitch @iainmacwhirter rank dishonesty.
@DAaronovitch @iainmacwhirter @iaindocherty it's not even that. It's rank dishonesty about diff between CU & using another nations currency.
@FraserNelson @JGForsyth who pray tell was Sir David Peel???
@KevH_87 odd you think @YesScotland board members are above criticism of performance in...political debate.

@alexmassie @LesleyRiddoch @BBCRadio4 hope lesley retracted her claim that Scottish university pension scheme is in the public sector.
@GenYes2014 @StephenNoon @NicolaSturgeon except Westminster in a £ union. #couldntmakeitup
@thomasselby @Tolliath @ShabanaMahmood @UKLabour must be very old kids.
@Tolliath @ShabanaMahmood @UKLabour who knows.
@Tolliath @ShabanaMahmood @UKLabour because we don't like 2 unlimited. Or maybe because Govt guidance guarantee all over the place...
@LesleyRiddoch thinks Scottish universities pension scheme is public sector. It's not. #basic #pensions #indyref
Scots will not be reassured by inaccurate and hope for the best case on #pensions by @LesleyRiddoch in Scotsman this morning #nothanks

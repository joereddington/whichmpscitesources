@BaggioRinaldi67 @scottishlabour I am which is why I'm challenging that characterisation. Need balanced sensible approach to debt/deficit Sun Apr 12 19:59:01 BST 2015
@BaggioRinaldi67 @scottishlabour vote was on balancing current account excluding capital investment spending. Sun Apr 12 19:33:51 BST 2015
@BaggioRinaldi67 @scottishlabour what do you mean by austerity? Sun Apr 12 19:00:16 BST 2015
@BaggioRinaldi67 @scottishlabour as wrong as she was about the mansion tax being used to fund 1000 more nurses in scotland. Sun Apr 12 18:02:09 BST 2015

@jgmclean2708 @lindababybliss every state has a dependency ratio it's simply the ratio of workforce to pensioners Sat Apr 11 15:32:54 BST 2015
@UnitedArabist @maggivaughan right about negotiations but after division of pension liabilities a separate Scottish system harder to fund. Sat Apr 11 14:25:00 BST 2015
@keirconway ps its Hardie. Sat Apr 11 14:22:56 BST 2015
@UnitedArabist @maggivaughan so if FFA happens in 2016 all bets are off regarding future pensions you appear to be saying. Sat Apr 11 14:21:45 BST 2015

Great @CKLabourParty @ED_Labour_Party team in #Condorrat this morning. #labourdoorstep http://t.co/wEzVEY12ab Sat Apr 11 13:44:10 BST 2015
@lindababybliss that assumes one thing cancels the other out. In this case it doesn't. Our dependency ratio on pensions worse than rUK. Fri Apr 10 23:29:48 BST 2015
@lindababybliss maybe. But Scots would have to pay more in just to maintain existing level of pension in Scottish only system. Fri Apr 10 22:42:01 BST 2015

@neiledwardlovat @severincarrell @Sam__F____ that's my point:) Fri Apr 10 15:28:45 BST 2015
@GHamilton129 @annebegg @severincarrell because Scotland will have to set up and pay Scottish state and public sector pensions Fri Apr 10 15:26:20 BST 2015
@holyroodmandy in the immortal words of clubber lang: (fiscal) pain. Fri Apr 10 15:23:30 BST 2015
“@Tubby_Isaacs: @colinmcgill @greggmcclymont This is the Tory "Gordo nicked my pension", is it?”> well spotted:) Fri Apr 10 15:12:19 BST 2015
@colinmcgill no fund just general taxation. G Brown transformed lives of poorest pensioners. Socialist redistribution via pension credit. Fri Apr 10 15:11:21 BST 2015
@Brackens1 @Sam__F____ it doesn't because lower Scottish ratio of those in work (to pay for) those (drawing) pensions. (Dependency ratio). Fri Apr 10 15:07:35 BST 2015
SNPers don't appear to understand how #pensions work or that full fiscal autonomy means Scottish exit from UK pensions system. Fri Apr 10 14:11:22 BST 2015
If SNPers want to see austerity in full flow look at Irish public sector pensions: http://t.co/cVd7wOTMnv Fri Apr 10 14:04:20 BST 2015
@langcatlocke @stevewebb1 @PeteChadborn not sure. But would have listened open mindedly. Suspect tight purdah rules the issue Fri Apr 10 12:58:08 BST 2015
@langcatlocke @stevewebb1 @PeteChadborn govt never approached opposition as far as I understand. Fri Apr 10 12:36:57 BST 2015
Will SNP dogma & Tory cynicism mean their MPs together vote for full fiscal austerity in Scotland? Fri Apr 10 12:17:30 BST 2015

@GMasterton we're promising significant redistribution of wealth and income which is socialism in action. Wed Apr 08 22:35:00 BST 2015
@GMasterton was making point that Hardie's whole political life was UK focused. Wed Apr 08 22:34:10 BST 2015
@GMasterton Keir Hardie was MP first in London & then Wales. Never in Scotland. A proud Scot who believed in devolution inside socialist UK. Wed Apr 08 22:14:53 BST 2015
@GMasterton what's the Keir Hardie definition? Wed Apr 08 21:57:42 BST 2015
Common sense not SNP dogma. http://t.co/plLqD3yovp Wed Apr 08 21:47:23 BST 2015

@GregLeft no. Privilege to represent Twechar, Waterside, Rosebank, Hillhead,  Eastside, Harestanes, Milton of Campsie, Lennoxtown. Tue Apr 07 19:32:07 BST 2015
@dmccafferty49 if snp don't think they can implement their policy - full fiscal autonomy - why are they saying they can? Peculiar. Tue Apr 07 16:16:37 BST 2015
@dmccafferty49 in case it's escaped your notice the SNP want to leave the UK & it's secure pensions system. Tue Apr 07 16:04:21 BST 2015
@dmccafferty49 UK has always paid pensions in full and on time. In pensions size matters. Just ask Irish pensioners whose pension cut. Tue Apr 07 15:53:12 BST 2015
@GrahamR64 I'll be pleased to endorse the work that nurses do all day every day at heart of NHS. Tue Apr 07 14:23:03 BST 2015
Seems only yesterday that John Swinney admitted the state pension was less affordable for Scotland outside the UK. #pensions Tue Apr 07 12:35:24 BST 2015
@dmccafferty49 "guarantee" only as strong as the institution standing behind it. Look at Irish pensions cuts & compare to UK resilience. Tue Apr 07 12:23:18 BST 2015
@JournoStephen what demographic changes are you referring to? Tue Apr 07 10:31:15 BST 2015
@JournoStephen yup faith is a powerful force. Especially in secular politics usually defined by incremental progress. Mon Apr 06 22:12:52 BST 2015
@JournoStephen confidence admirable. Suspension of critical faculties not. All a long way from David Hume... Mon Apr 06 22:04:38 BST 2015
@JournoStephen perhaps. Altho my reference was to the institution rather than the electorate. Mon Apr 06 21:39:54 BST 2015
In the church of the SNP nationalist faith trumps rational enquiry. Mon Apr 06 21:31:23 BST 2015
If SNPers want to see austerity in full flow look at Irish public sector pensions arbitrary cut in payments: http://t.co/cVd7wOTMnv Mon Apr 06 20:55:10 BST 2015
@Samuelsdale @thomasselby @stevewebb1 @jameskirkup I do indeed! Mon Apr 06 20:45:19 BST 2015

Frightening lack of knowledge of how pension systems work among SNPers on my timeline tonight. Mon Apr 06 17:28:10 BST 2015
@ChristinaSNP @cammyk_67 @YsabelleStewart just look at Ireland where state pension payments cut after financial crash. Promise not contract. Mon Apr 06 17:25:32 BST 2015
There's lots of SNP folk out there who don't appear to like the reality of binning Barnett. Mon Apr 06 16:06:43 BST 2015
@cammyk_67 @YsabelleStewart assets & liabilities would have to be divvied up & Scotland set up separate pensions system. Mon Apr 06 16:05:48 BST 2015
Binning Barnett means Scottish pensioners and savers would lose guarantees & security of UK pension system. http://t.co/yx0a2kqUyx Mon Apr 06 15:50:41 BST 2015

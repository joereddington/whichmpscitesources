@VvnSin re: Tatton - the road in front is private property, though I know the Council are working with the owners to sort out the site.
@toriamjones two thirds of the public voted for parties that wanted students to pay more - the Lib Dems didn't win the election!
@DomRushton too few people from poorer backgrounds attend University and we need to encourage more, it's right that they get extra help
@MattDurrantx that's in addition to the lower repayments.  There's extra help for both students from poorer backgrounds & low-earning grads
@MattDurrantx  regardless of your background if you're in bottom 25% of earners as a graduate you will repay less than under current system
@MattDurrantx  The poorest quarter of graduates will pay back less than today under the Coalition proposals, wealthier grads will pay more.
@MattDurrantx  I believe this is the best option available to us; I fully accept it's far from perfect
@Sutfol99 In Coalition we've been able to make the proposals much better & fairer than if Lab or Con had been in Govt alone
Graduates will pay over £500 a year less than now, more support for poorer & part-time students.
I would have liked to be in a situation to deliver an even better deal, but these proposals are fairer than those from Labour & NUS
I believe the Coalition plans offer the best available deal for students, so I will be voting for the proposals.
A busy day in the constituency today with surgery this morning & several visits this afternoon.
Had an interesting tuition fees discussion. To get my support, any proposal must be fairer & more progressive than what we have now.
Completely unacceptable that so many Labour MPs are defending Phil Woolas - he broke the law and should accept the consequences.

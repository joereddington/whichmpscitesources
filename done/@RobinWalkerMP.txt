#Worcester unemployment down over 500 in last year, 1,300 since election and 1,500 since it peaked under Labour in 01/10, lowest since 2007
This quarter's claimant count in #worcester the lowest since 2005  & 2nd lowest monthly figure since NOMIS records began in 2006
Good to see another fall in #worcester unemployment, claimant count more than halved since GE2010 & wages starting to beat inflation
In Worcester unemployment has more than halved since GE2010 but by supporting business and investing in #apprentices we can go further

@syhawkes new radiotherapy centre at Worcs Royal Hospital which I campaigned for with local patients, new midwife led unit coming soon

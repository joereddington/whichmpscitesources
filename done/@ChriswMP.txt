Tories happy to use housing benefit to enrich private landlords but won't build council houses. 40% of £25bn HB goes to private landlords Mon Apr 13 23:50:48 BST 2015
@orniastic @HouseofTwits You are right on your first point and wrong on your second Mon Apr 13 23:46:23 BST 2015

The chap in the #bbcqt audience who doesn't like "mudslinging" forgot to mention that it's the Tories who are up to their elbows in mud Thu Apr 09 23:05:06 BST 2015
Tories desperate to avoid talking about their support for tax dodging non-doms but pathetic smears to hoodwink voters won't work Thu Apr 09 22:57:22 BST 2015
Desperate Tories in the gutter again on #bbcnewsnight. Let's get rid of 'em and end their vile brand of politics. Vote Labour on 7 May Thu Apr 09 22:44:39 BST 2015

The Tories are the political wing of the tax avoidance industry. That's why they won’t back Labour’s plans to abolish non-dom status. Thu Apr 09 09:35:13 BST 2015
The Tories' reliance on a reported £16 million from non-dom donors shows why the Tories won’t back Labour’s plans to abolish non-dom status. Thu Apr 09 09:34:06 BST 2015
The Tories always stand up for the wrong people from tax dodgers to bloodsports thugs. Vote Labour on 7 May https://t.co/Yg03DuDUue Thu Apr 09 09:14:02 BST 2015

@1jamiefoster In your world Jamie, rich people would still be sending poor kids up chimneys. It's solidarity and compassion that stopped it Sun Apr 05 10:14:39 BST 2015
@1jamiefoster No Jamie, solidarity & compassion are the very essence of humanity. Sun Apr 05 10:06:04 BST 2015
@1jamiefoster "Freedom & self reliance" are easy when you're wealthy Jamie. So I prefer solidarity & compassion because that frees everyone Sun Apr 05 09:57:30 BST 2015
A Tory win means more tax cuts 4 millionaires & more misery for people on low incomes. Vote Labour 4 a better Britain

@rattlecans @dustybun1 You clearly haven't as it says no such thing. It was SNP MPs who sided with the Tories & helped put Thatcher in No 10 Fri Apr 03 23:23:10 BST 2015
@Coulstock1 @suethorney Tell that to the Scottish communities that relied on the coal, steel, shipbuilding, car & engineering industries Fri Apr 03 23:18:52 BST 2015
@Coulstock1 @suethorney ...and heralded in Thatcherism, which smashed working class communities all over the UK including Scotland. Fri Apr 03 23:10:23 BST 2015
@Coulstock1 @suethorney But SNP MPs backed the no confidence motion that brought down Labour Govt enabling Thatcherism to be inflicted on UK Fri Apr 03 22:37:52 BST 2015
@RhianLlewelyn Indeed they have and the SNP's doing its best to help a Tory Govt into power as it did in 1979 Fri Apr 03 22:31:52 BST 2015
@Coulstock1 @suethorney Have you read it Harry? If not, get it out of the library. You can't airbrush the SNP's culpability for Thatcherism Fri Apr 03 22:28:55 BST 2015
@TheHappySlapper You're getting confused with the Tory Party Fri Apr 03 21:48:37 BST 2015

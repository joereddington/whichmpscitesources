Vote Labour in 2015 to end the zero-zero economy where millionaires avoid their tax liability & workers are forced into zero hour contracts
Britain needs a pay rise. In 173 days vote Labour 2 tackle UK's grotesque income inequality & exploitation of workers http://t.co/k58lh82PAc
@Doubleday1966 @TheHappySlapper That's just complete  garbage Ian
@u6239 No. We elect parties not presidents. Let's focus on policies not media driven, lowest common denominator x-factor style democracy
Nigel Farage and UKIP are exposed on C4 News for trying to hoodwink voters. Make no mistake, UKIP are turbocharged Tories. Vote Labour
Nigel Farage and UKIP exposed on C4 News for their view that working women who have a baby are worth less than men
Nigel Farage and UKIP have been outed on C4 News as supporting privatisation of the NHS despite Farage's weasel words

@JAHoddy @trishysunflower @AgainstHunting @UKLabour @TheGreenParty That can best be achieved by joining Labour & helping Labour win in 2015
@JAHoddy If you help the Tories to win, what will you say to the victims of Tory policies? Are you bothered about the damage they'll wreak
@JAHoddy @Green_Alex97 Not about taking power from me. What's dangerous is helping the Tories to inflict more poverty & environmental damage
@Green_Alex97 Check my other tweets. Most of them give positive reasons to vote Labour because Labour offers only hope of a progressive govt
@Green_Alex97 @JAHoddy I'm left wing too, but I want to make difference. If you're content to assist the Tories to win that's up to you
@BillLinton1 @JAHoddy @TheGreenParty Excuse me? Living wage, job guarantee for kids, 1m homes, axe bedroom tax, save NHS, end fuel poverty.
@Green_Alex97 @JAHoddy Are you? Is that why you'd risk electing a Tory Govt so you can say how left wing you are?
"@labourpress: The Tories are taking more and more from hedge funds - 
http://t.co/CSgo1oFVSE" > You can't trust the Tories. Vote Labour
@Green_Alex97 @JAHoddy It is precisely because we want to implement those values that Green Party members ought to work for a Labour Govt
@Green_Alex97 @JAHoddy But I want 2 implement progressive green policies rather than just talk about them. Join Labour 2 make talk a reality
@Green_Alex97 @JAHoddy @TheGreenParty Nothing pathetic about NHS, min wage, equal pay, hunt ban, Climate Change Act - all Labour initiatives
In 175 days vote Labour 4 a govt that'll make the banking industry work for Britain http://t.co/sNVuQbTLBZ Countdown http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
@JAHoddy @Ed_Miliband @TheGreenParty No, if you want to make progressive change happen rather than just talk about it, you need to win power
@JAHoddy @TheGreenParty You need to win power to deliver progressive policies. Green Party are like a Conservative fifth column
@Charrrr_xx No problem at all. I will continue to press her case to secure a fair deal for her. She has been treated abysmally
@JAHoddy @TheGreenParty @CarolineLucas @natalieben Green Party can only help the forces of conservatism. Vote Labour for a progressive Govt

@connor607 @GABaines Excuse me? You've missed the point Coonor. I  was an apprentice bricky in 1976 . People shouldn't be excluded as now
@GABaines UK economy isn't working for people. Neoliberalism should be junked. Capitalism must be slave of democracy not the other way round
@connor607 @GABaines You're wrong Connor. I bought a new 3 bed waterfront semi when was 19 year old apprentice bricky thanks to Labour Govt
@GABaines Sky high inflation inherited from previous Govt but was caused by oil crisis which you also conveniently forget to mention
@GABaines ...oh and you omitted the social contract that ensured lower paid workers were protected and housing costs were controlled
@GABaines ...oh and you also forgot that manufacturing represented 30% of the economy and we produced our own coal instead of importing it
@GABaines ...oh and economic growth being double what it's been under this appalling Tory-LibDm Govt & workers seeing wages grow not decline
@GABaines You forgot young working class people able to buy a house of their own & N. Sea Oil being earmarked to benefit of British economy
@GABaines Derby winning the League - twice! Young working class people able to afford to buy a house, N. Sea Oil earmarked to benefit  UK
@minkebill I agree, but that shouldn't stop us tackling this abuse too
@minkebill The NHS is a priority. It's not an either/or question. A Labour Govt will need fix numerous injustuces as we did in 1945/64/74/97

@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk The pist-war social democratic consensus served us pretty well from 1945 to 1979
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk That's coz the neoliberal market economic model that they heralded in is pretty much the root cause of every ill
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk They have a place, but not to provide housing to people on low & avg earnings
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk That's because the Tories residualised & stigmatised council housing
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk We'll have to agree to differ. I'll continue to fight for tenants and you can continue to stand up for landlords
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk I was only elected in 2010, but I agree that was a clear failure by the previous govt
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk Even with the cap, private sector rents are oftern around 3 times higher than council house rents
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk Thanks to Tory deregulation that allowed slum landlords to milk the HB system and get rich quick
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk ...It allowed many private landlords to get rich quick courtesy of the taxpayer by charging excessive rents
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk Private rented sector should never have been used to provide social housing.
@wit_xx @nusuk Many reputable private landlords support 3 year tenancies. Govt must do more to support generation rent
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk And longer tenancies will help to achieve that
@wit_xx @nusuk Buy to let seems to thrive with current 6 month tenancies, 3 year tenancies builds in more certainty for landlords not less
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk By building council houses 2 supplement those built by private sector, which has only ever delivered 150k pa max
@hughandkath Not sure I follow. What points to me?
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk They'd still be able 2 gain possession 4 rent arrears etc. Longer tenancies would help landlords & reduce voids
@hughandkath @wit_xx @nusuk Well we've said we'll build 200k homes pa, cap rent rises & outlaw rogue letting agents. Join us to argue 4 more
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk By limiting rents. Many tenants would be paying less in mortgage payments than their rent & so many are trapped
@hughandkath @nusuk I don't think immigration per se is the issue, rather it's the way rogue landlords & ruthless employers exploit migrants
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk I want to protect tenants.
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk Well we've said rent rises will be capped, but I would prefer to go further
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk We both know the history. It was wrongheaded approach. Govt should've limited rents & built more council houses
@hughandkath @nusuk Well I do even though I wasn't an MP at the time. We need a new approach to housing. Labour's plans are a lot better now
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk I would cap rents instead to cut the 9.5bn private sector HB bill rather than penalising tenants
@hughandkath @nusuk No that was wrong too, but it wasn't applied retrospectively. Action should have been taken to  cap rents instead
@wit_xx @hughandkath @nusuk Not retrospectively. Action needed to cap private sector rents and more council houses to provide alternative

@nusuk I am supporting Derby City Council's efforts to improve Derby's offer.  #GenerationVote
@nusuk The Govt's attacks on disabled people are reprehensible. Social security policy should be underpinned by compassion #generationvote
@nusuk Absolutely! A Lab Government will scrap the Bedroom Tax #GenerationVote
@nusuk I want young people to engage in politics because by working together we can change the world. Unity is strength #GenerationVote
@nusuk We need to grow manufacturing and require minimum number of apprenticeships to be included in bids for govt contacts #generationvote
@nusuk I am always happy to meet students and attend functions and meetings on the campus
@nusuk Jobs guarantee, commitment 2 build 1m homes, support 4 manufacturing & public services will tackle youth unemployment #generationvote
@nusuk I'll vote to repeal NHS Act that allows up to 49% of the NHS to be privatised. I'm petitioning on this in Derby #generationvote
@markhankins1982 @nusuk I'm sympathetic to that but need to consider how to fund it.
@nusuk I believe tuition fees should be abolished altogether and funded through a graduate tax and/or general taxation #generationvote

@1962sb @Stoobie1964 Govt's shafted workers in the private sector as well as workers in the public sector too
@GABaines The pay rises of staff working for PCS are linked to rises PCS members receive
@Stoobie1964 @1962sb That's a false choice. Higher wages drive growth & generate more jobs enabling people to spend on goods & services
Britain needs a pay rise. Austerity causes low pay, poverty & despair. That's why I'm supporting PCS today @1962sb http://t.co/AfPRQDqiFf

@KulganofCrydee In the wake of a worldwide banking meltdown brought about by the failure of neoliberal economics inflicted on UK by Thatcher
@KulganofCrydee No, there's a difference between not managing to implement a pledge than doing the diametric opposite of what you've said
@KulganofCrydee Hold on, the PM explicitly said there'd be no top-down NHS reorganisation then did the opposite. We're saying what we'll do
@KulganofCrydee I've answered your question. We'll put our plans in our manifesto, unlike the Tories, who did the opposite of what they said
@vron_king Hi Veronica - Yes I do indeed remember and I've retweeted your article on @LabourList
@KulganofCrydee The changes we'll bring about will benefit people & ensure govt funds are used 2 improve NHS not shareholders' bank balances
@KulganofCrydee It'll stop NHS being privatised & unlike the Tories we've said what we'll do. Cameron promised no top down reorganisation
@KulganofCrydee We'll repeal the Act, integrate social care & stop the NHS being used as a cash-cow to generate profits for private sector
In 205 days vote Labour 2 save the NHS. Tories now say reforms a mistake. Imagine the damage a Tory/UKIP Gov would do http://t.co/k58lh7Les8

@TonyJWright @Foxinparliament Labour's not perfect but it's best vehicle 2 deliver progressive legislation & the 3 vegan MPs are all Labour
@TonyJWright @Foxinparliament No I am not at odds at all. You should speak to some Labour Party members. You'll find I'm mainstream Labour
@TonyJWright @Foxinparliament Meanwhile neoliberal, pro hunt Tories carry on exploiting people and animals. No thanks Tony
@jeremyksm @TonyJWright @Foxinparliament There's nothing glib about what I said Jeremy. I want a world where sabs aren't necessary
@TonyJWright @Foxinparliament Now you're being ridiculous Tony. Let me assure you I want to jettison the neoliberal economic disaster
@TonyJWright @Foxinparliament If progressive vote is split, it makes it easier for pro-hunt, pro-badgercull, animal exploiting Tories to win

@Colchester1648 Congratulations and good luck
Letâ€™s use Parliament as a force 4 good & ignore anti politics narrative beloved of certain media outlets & UKIP et al http://t.co/xoaAX2c9av
Iâ€™m not often in agreement with Tory MPs but this is an excellent article by @AlistairBurtMP in defence of democracy  http://t.co/xoaAX2c9av
@noush555 I am confident that a Labour Govt with @Ed_Miliband as PM would be the most reforming Govt since Clem Atlee's 1945/51 Labour Govt
@noush555 We need to redouble effort to elect Labour Govt to stop badger cull and save the NHS
@PaulBurd It's not my "opinion" it's fact. Look at views of UKIP's elected reps. Look at their last manifesto and how they venerate Thatcher
@MorrisseyMcDog Yes, by not renewing and varying contracts
Derby residents continue to show their opposition this morning to this Govt's NHS sell-off http://t.co/Ehw3cslWpe
@EnfieldTUSC @WestMidsFBU We need political power 2 support working class communities & reverse austeruty not gesture politics. Vote Labour
In 228 days vote Labour if you think companies who win Govt contacts should be required to pay the Living Wage http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
@PaulBurd But do you know what UKIP stand for? UKIP is a more extreme rightwing party than the Tories and is no friend to working people
Spent an enjoyable day in Mickleover & Derwent discussing choice facing Derby next year http://t.co/jDpkUsgYho
@ann4animals @JulieHillingMP If we tackle exploitative employers and recruitment agencies it would go a long way to addressing your concerns
@PaulBurd Vote Labour then Paul. It's the best vehicle we've got to deliver social justice and progressive social change
@PaulBurd Oh, and are you happy with the present govt then, or would you prefer an even more rightwing version via UKIP?
Britainâ€™s at a crossroads. We must ditch centralisation & power-hoarding. Labour's the party to lead this revolution http://t.co/ngM60vdEza
@ann4animals @JulieHillingMP Vote for Julie because she's a great MP. As you are concerned about wildlife, vote Labour to protect it
@5H4K3EL Yes
@Ian_W_Baker Yes I do, I've been arguing for it for years and wrote this piece about over two years ago http://t.co/P1axeG0k8K
The Scottish people have spoken. In 229 days the UK can speak with one voice 4 social justice by electing Labour Govt http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
Here's what I wrote over two years ago about the need to settle the English question by devolving power to local govt http://t.co/cs73kKX8Fy
@Neilltheram @Stoobie1964 You mean strongest growth & greatest redistribution of nation's income delivered by post war governments
@Stoobie1964 @Neilltheram ...and proud to be so. Socialist values delivered the NHS, equal pay, minimum wage & outlawed race discrimination
@Neilltheram @Stoobie1964 Hayek's theories are responsible for some of the most damaging attacks on decency on both sides of the Atlantic
Whatever Scots have decided constitutional reform in England must be devolved power to local govt not @johnredwood's English parliament idea
Please Scotland vote No today & in 230 days help us elect a Labour Govt to deliver social justice in all four nations of the United Kingdom
Watch this barnstorming speech by Gordon Brown. Utterly brilliant. Solidarity is better than isolation http://t.co/pWmQchEUjl
@frederickJWill2 @trevburnip Indeed, fair point succinctly put.
@Rokewood @leftlinks When we communicate our radical progressive offer that will shift.  Btw, the last poll I saw we were 8 points ahead.
In 231 days vote Labour to secure future of our NHS after the King's Fund warned that it's facing financial meltdown http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
It's not enough to to simply refund people for delays in processing passports, Govt needs to reverse cuts in staffing http://t.co/LXkY7XK8N2
In 232 days vote Labour if you want a govt to really cares about the environment. This lot's been disastrous http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
@ossieram @stevegnomee ...and the Ku Klux Klan claim to be Christian. Just because they say they follow a religion doesn't make it so.
UKIP efforts to politicise child sex abuse has echoes of the hateful propaganda Joseph Goebbels used in Nazi Germany http://t.co/BZO69xMisH
@C7RKY Maggie's on it
A huntsman with Middleton Hunt in court charged with interfering with a badger sett by restricting the entrance http://t.co/mHM9p32YuU

@ossieram @stevegnomee No Gaz. They are masquerading as Muslims, but ISIL's ideology is a million miles from Islam
We should stop referring to ISIL as jihadists, they're brutal serial killers http://t.co/dblNrkgIfj
Spent morning in Chaddesden, with excellent Labour team, talking to residents about choice facing Derby next year http://t.co/SgGT7amFMm
@StevePLloyd @TheGreenParty You don't really believe that do you Steve? Labour's best vehicle we've got to deliver progressive social change
@MorrisseyMcDog Solidarity extends to both sides of the border
@chalimangp @lukey_stanger @TheGreenParty Not true. @UKLabour will secure million new homes, stop NHS sell-off, guarantee jobs 4 kids & more
@chalimangp @lukey_stanger @TheGreenParty He stepped down almost 9 years ago, move on
@paintballasylum I have and I do
In 234 days vote Labour to restore social justice as the key policy driver for govt policy. http://t.co/k58lh7Les8
@SZeitblom Good luck
@renieanjeh @MissLilySummers @TheGreenParty A progressive party of Govt. The centre ground has moved left http://t.co/aA5TRYkI1l
@andy_s_64 Hmm? Increasing min wage, stopping NHS sell-off, building million new houses, devolving power, scrapping bedroom tax. Think again
@DearMeYes @oatsy8 @Tom_Celt @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty They don't!
@frederickJWill2 @Jon_Proctor92 @TheGreenParty Let's build a progressive coalition behind Labour to recapture the spirit of 1945
@DearMeYes @oatsy8 @Tom_Celt @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty I believe in working class solidarity. If that makes me "delusion" I plead guilty
@DixonJonathon Ever it was thus with the Tories though
@paulturner2012 @LabourLeft @chunkymark @albanachan There's nothing fake about my politics Paul.
@stevetopple @mwarne @TheGreenParty @LabourLeft Okay, but remember we can build a better world by working together in solidarity
@rosspatton91 @TheGreenParty But we need political power to achieve those things. Help us make it happen by working with Labour
@Dog_Shit_Taco @albanachan @chunkymark in order to deliver higher minimum wage, stop NHS sell-off, scrap bed tax, guarantee jobs 4 kids etc
@oatsy8 @Tom_Celt @DearMeYes @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty Solidarity means securing UK-wide prog Govt. Vote NO nxt week. Vote Labour nxt year
@JS_Lamb @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty  Join us to help the party make that journey then. Ed Miliband's said we've turned page on New Labour
@stevetopple @mwarne @TheGreenParty @LabourLeft Okay, but read this too. If you agree with me, please join me http://t.co/aA5TRYkI1l
@Dog_Shit_Taco @albanachan @chunkymark That's a huge leap! Just because Tories also oppose independence doesn't mean we're arm in arm
@DixonJonathon @efoody Not true. I was bricky, my Dad was a plasterer, my Mam was a cleaner. Labour's best vehicle 2 deliver social justice
@DearMeYes @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty Come on Declan, think about the meaning of solidarity. It's the antithesis of nationalist isolationism
@rosspatton91 @TheGreenParty ...In order to increase min wage, stop NHS sell-off, devolve power, guarantee jobs 4 kids, tackle fuel poverty
@Tom_Celt @LabourEoin @TheGreenParty Don't retreat 2 the cosy certainties of sectarianism. We need political power 2 deliver social justice
@stevetopple @mwarne @TheGreenParty @LabourLeft No, it precisely because I want neoliberalism destroyed that I urge you to join Labour
@Dog_Shit_Taco @albanachan @chunkymark No we haven't. Don't walk away, help us ensure Labour is able to deliver a progressive agenda
@TheGreenParty Not true; progressives working together inside Labour Party secures better policy outcomes. United we stand divided we fall
@albanachan @chunkymark That's why progressives should stick together on both sides of the border. Isolationism is a dead end street
I urge all @TheGreenParty members to join Labour or at least vote Labour to secure a progressive Govt next year
@chunkymark @albanachan Solidarity means working together Mark. Surprised you support isolationism. United we stand divided we fall. Vote NO

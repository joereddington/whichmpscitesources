Business rates are still rising by 2% meaning an average rise of over £250 in April #AS2013
In 2010 Osborne said the economy would have grown 7.7% by now, but has grown by just 2.5% - slower than America (6.4%) or Germany (4.4%)
There needs to be a rebalancing of the economy towards business investment and net profits. Biz investment is below its pre-recession peak.

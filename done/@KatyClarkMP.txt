My thoughts how benefits up-rating cuts are hurting vulnerable people. Hoping to speak in debate later @LeftFootFwd http://t.co/deH1kfyN9K
JSA from April £4.14 lower than it would have been under RPI due to coalition’s RPI/CPI switch and 1% up-rating cap
Disabled people in ESA support group will be £5.11 a week worse off from April due to coalition’s RPI to CPI switch and 1% up-rating cap
DLA recipients receiving higher rate mobility and care will be over £570 worse off as a result of coalition’s switch from RPI to CPI by 2015
Carers on carers’ allowance will be over £250 worse off in 2015 as a result of coalition’s switch from RPI to CPI
By 2015 pensioners will be over £100 worse off as a result of coalition’s switch from RPI to CPI despite triple lock guarantee
Today Parliament debates benefits up-rating. Coalition cuts have left pensioners & vulnerable groups worse off

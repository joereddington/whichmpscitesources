@CllrMikePowell  Why don't U do s'thing useful Mike & boost local econ buying a sandwich from Panini's instead of trying to give em the Muni
"@NickServini @David_Cameron talks up wales:- v different tone to offa's dyke line between life and death," 
Janus-faced, as ever then.
@CllrMikePowell Mike, your warped attempt to secure the Muni for a Sandwich Chain instead of the community failed. Give it up.
"@masherwilkins: .@OwenSmithMP please #saveourNHS. Vote for Clive Efford's #NHS bill and stop privatisation" looking forward to doing so!
@IrregularShed it's got no place in our NHS.
Excellent launch last night of the @WorkplacePledge RT if you agree with me that we need this in the manifesto http://t.co/0UlFZkIjv5
@timhhartley good idea....
Just voted for a #fairdeal4yourlocal.100 pubs close in Wales every year. Labour’s amendment will help struggling landlords.
.@AleeedThomas It was a joke lads. You don't really think I'd tell Dafydd Lockyear he was playing for the Seconds...?
Thanks to @evrfc for a great game & a warm welcome tonight. Brilliant rugby,and even better banter, at a great Valleys club.C U @ Sardis.
Great win for @PontypriddRFC seconds @evrfc . They looked so happy before kickoff @haydht2000
Fantastic atmosphere @PontypriddRFC v. @evrfc . Real rugby.
@parmatma1111 Hi Carol. How's Jason? @JoStevensLabour
Just caught up with today's W. Mail. Well done to @Nigelrefowens for denouncing homophobic bigots. Real rugby fans won't put up with this.
@CllrMikePowell I honestly think you will not be forgiven if your games jeopardise the prospects of the Muni being maintained for the arts.
.@CllrMikePowell It was scrutinised. Cncl took the decision to transfer the Muni to the Community Arts bid not the Cafe Chain. Right choice.
@CllrMikePowell Look, Mike, you are just playing silly buggers and delaying the community takeover. Stop it. Withdraw the Call In with grace
@CllrMikePowell Not my biz plan. Muni Working Grp (Town Cncl & Arts groups) has one informed by public consultation, which they'll continue.
Labour's leader wants to end the inequality and insecurity which blights lives in Britain.That's why he will lead the country #6monthstowin
@hayleyj67296570 Hi Hayley. We're drawing up a list of people who'd like to volunteer in some fashion (like at Chapter) You are now on it!
@CllrMikePowell But you are right: My mind is closed to giving the Muni to a private cafe company, as you are strangely suggesting.
.@CllrMikePowell This has nothing to do with me, save that I want the Muni to be maintained as an Arts Centre. You should just get on board.
@CllrMikePowell So you back up a commercial cafe chain instead of local community groups. You're playing politics. I intend to ignore u now.
@GeoffCripps  Of course. What we need is prof. programming and performance as well as community arts, but community not commercially led.
When you read comments by bankers  rigging markets (again) you understand just why our society values them so highly: http://t.co/JoqI3JCHd5
.@CllrMikePowell There was only one Community-led, not 4 profit project to run an arts centre. I have no idea why you are not supporting it.
@RichardJMurphy anybody would swear they weren't looking very hard. Do you suppose they might be culturally predisposed not to?
.@CllrMikePowell I'll ignore your usual rudeness, Cllr Powell. I don't need to see Panini's plan to know people would prefer a  arts centre.
.@CllrMikePowell  Why on earth are u pushing 4 Muni to be turned into a Panini's Cafe instead of a community arts centre? It makes no sense.
@ianamurray78 Support for both was never in doubt, Comrade. Can't sign now 'til Parly back in session but will do then.
@ianamurray78 I've always said conventions were made to be broken...
@ianamurray78 ian, there's a tradition frontbenchers do not sign EDMs - even ones we might agree with - as to do can undermine solidarity.
@suzsca I know. Goodness knows what the man is doing. The other bidder was a local cafe chain. I think we need a theatre more than a cafe.

@GlennPage_ but agree we need an elected second chamber...and one that reflects the make up of the UK.
@GlennPage_ no, elected. But PR was rejected by the public, lest we forget.
.@HMThompson_   No they won't do that, as they want to present more powers for Wales as justification for Tory Votes on English Laws.
@peterblackwales @adrianmasters84 @jennyranderson Pleased you acknowledge it's a U-turn, Peter, but last I looked you're part of the Govt?
@owainrhyslewis @jennyranderson No, we've already committed to it....but we're not in government, see, so can't enact it ourselves.
Given Tories have now joined x-party agreement on Reserved Power they could simply have made provision for the change in the Bill #WalesBill
Good to see @jennyranderson complete the Tory U-Turn on Reserved powers and promise a 'framework' by March 1st. We'll test what that means.
@Dunadan9 no it was of its time, reflective of the then lesser appetite for devolution in Wales.That appetite has grown, and powers with it
@BrynTeilo @SionGoronwy @Dunadan9 cobblers.
.@Dunadan9 1. Labour delivered devo & reserved powers are the next step. 2. Labour has said we'll deliver fair funding and fill Barnett gap.

"@Eddie3652: @OwenSmithMP But don't forget veterans battling issues like the Bedroom tax and other IDS things" No. Why we must scrap them!

Does Tory abstention on our motion mean they also agree with us that Coalfields need continued regeneration and support?
So the Tories didn't vote against our motion on justice for the coalfields. That mean they agree Thatcher misled the public on pit closures?

@colesypontyboy yeah, well seeing as I was a journalist for 10 years and in business for five before I was an MP, that's bull too.
.@colesypontyboy Don't bet on it. The vast majority of Ponty people have better values than to vote for Farage and his Thatcherite politics.

@dylanjonesevans @TheCelticManor That shld be beneath u Dylan. But had u checked your facts u'd know I said I'd reject a rise & take 5% cut
@dylanjonesevans @TheCelticManor Dylan, could you manage on 200 quid a week before tax? BTW, you still a Tory adviser?
@dylanjonesevans @TheCelticManor no, I asked them yesterday. They employ 1200, 400 as casual abour. Most will be min wage. Zero Hrs?
@dylanjonesevans @TheCelticManor My facts were correct Dylan. The hotel, like others, employs 55 casual workers @ £5 hour & most at min wage

Thanks to all the Welsh men and women - of all parties and none - who came to Scotland this week to argue for solidarity and co-operation.
Farage and Cameron united today in responding to yesterday's decision by seeking to concentrate more power in their hands & at Westminster.
The Constituency Bill, Individual Registration & now English Votes: a triptych of Tory gerrymandering to hang on to power at Westminster.
So the last thing Scotland needs is a  constitutional fix which reduces Scotland's voice at Westminster & strengthens Tories' grip on power

Veterans of The Greys are voting 'No' in Cumbernauld #indyref http://t.co/ToNc7b0JDW
Big thumbs up for 'No' from three NHS workers voting before starting their shift. Vote No for the NHS. #indyref
@stuartbrown337 @terencecallacha @shazzam24 @blairmcdougall no, but 43% of Plaid voters and 90% of Labour voters do #nothanks
@kisimul22 @shazzam24 @blairmcdougall yeah, it's called polling week. Been in my diary for a while.
"@shazzam24: @kisimul22 @blairmcdougall I didn't get impression you'd been sent you were happy to blether about all sorts" #blethertogether
@shazzam24 @kisimul22 @blairmcdougall no one sent me, as i hope you could see. Owen
.@terencecallacha @shazzam24 @blairmcdougall 70% of Welsh oppose  indy. The philosophy of 'I'm alright, Jack' has little appeal to us.
@kisimul22 @shazzam24 @blairmcdougall Rubbish. I came to campaign with comrades for solidarity & social justice.
Beautiful evening and solid support for Labour's No campaign in Kirky. Ponty, Bolton and Cumbernauld #bettertogether http://t.co/DYRLdWEdXi
.@SimonThomasAC er, that's cos Ed Miliband and I commited to that in Llandudno 6 months ago. Dont u pay attent'n to what happens in N Wales?
Kirkintilloch is voting with its stomach...they can't shift these in Peter's Bakery, but the No cakes are all gone... http://t.co/MLrstYDXsM
.@KillSocialism1 no, comrade, paid myself.
"I'm voting No for my job, my pension and my children & I resent being asked to reject my British identity." A proud Scot in Kirkintilloch.
"@KerryPollard_: @shazzam24 @OwenSmithMP thanks, we are 'better together' - one nation - one family!"
@JamesWilliams88 What a load of rubbish. I'm from Ponty & live there still. Don't tell me I don't care about Ponty cos I care about UK too.
@arusbridger Mmm. I grew up in The Valleys, live there & represent them, this isn't my truth, or any truth. 70+% oppose Welsh Independence
"@WalesPolitics: 'Independence would not make me more Welsh', says @fmwales  #FMQs" Nor me. #bettertogether
Great to talk to residents of Ravenswood, Cumbernauld, this morning. Good people, considering the decision v. carefully, & mostly voting No.
@John_5_1 Having a great time. Thanks.
.@TheDonBot2014 May The Force be with us...
@John_5_1 no. It was a joke. Have to keep a sense of humour, even amid the most serious debatem
.@Elin_A_Roberts not sure where u got your 40% ...but 43% of Plaid voters (according to YouGov) are opposed to Welsh indy. RU one of them?
.@RhianLlewelyn Nothing self-serving about pool risk and share resources across all peoples in UK. Nationalism, however, is innately selfish
@sparrrowman @DafyddMeurig @YesMorningside @YesScotland I'm paying. £120. The modern price of missionary work by Welsh socialists.
Just boarding a flight North to campaign for solidarity and a No vote...we marginally outnumber the Plaid activists on the plane. #goodomen
.@chrisshipitv Yes, up 5%, amid blanket coverage of #indyref in our country...while Plaid slip 6% behind UKIP. More Big No than the Big Mo.
Today's YouGov poll shows almost 40% of Plaid voters would vote No if in Scotland. And even more would say #nothanks for Wales. #Walessaysno
@EmyrYoung @owilew and here's the link: http://t.co/0vhAQ2lhZm
.@EmyrYoung @owilew My minds been focussed for quite a while, Emyr. Here's my thoughts on the need for a New Union, from September 2011.
@EmyrYoung @owilew cobblers. Not rhetoric to state we will adopt the same tax powers as laid our in our Scottiah devo commission.
@EmyrYoung @owilew er, we have. In speech after speech, starting at our Llandudno conference in the Spring.
.@EmyrYoung @owilew As we've long said:  same model as Scots. Same offer on tax. And devo to England too. Greater symmetry and stability.
.@devcymru Wales will have more powers if Labour wins, whatever the  result on Thursday.
.@EmyrYoung @owilew Nothing cheap about the truth. Wales raises £18Bn in taxes and spends £34Bn. Barnett gap is £150m. Facts, not betrayal.
WALES SAYS #NOTHANKS Latest poll shows 64% of Welsh want Scots to stay. Support for Welsh Independence surges to a whopping 17%. 70% opposed
.@owilew Whatever the motives, the desired result is nationalism's selfish isolationism. 'My country first' is no socialist credo #indyref
"Panel #bbcdp @thomasbrake,  @OwenSmithMP @MarkFieldMP  @Jo_Coburn http://t.co/AbLz5go0SO" Quick clue: I'm one with rugby posts behind me.
Nationalism's ugly language of division on full display in @elinjonesplaid piece for the W.Mail. No one 'betrays' Wales in saying #nothanks
.@TheDaveBrookes when r u having me back? I've been waiting for an invitation. Come report from Sardis on the mighty @PontypriddRFC sometime
.@lewcym @princessgleek Nor when independence will reduce the ability of any future gov in Scotland or at Westminster to redistribute wealth
.@lewcym @princessgleek Not when the independence will lead to regressive policies in Scotland: lower tax for banks & the rich 1/2 #indyref
Did you know there are over 200 War Graves in the Pontypridd Constituency. Thanks to @CWGC for visiting them with me. http://t.co/eyJvSwMzqV
"@gtfm1079: .@PontypriddRFC Jake Thomas & Lewis K Williams & Alun on Ponty Rugby Show tonight from 6:30 http://t.co/CnzLkc732K" Tune in!
.@janicejenkins6 No, lots are re-energised: to re-state our belief in working together across borders for soc justice & equality. Socialism.
.@princessgleek No, you r right: 10% of Welsh support indy. The rest of us don't. We are a progressive nation. We believe in solidarity.
.@LeanneWood @daily_politics I look forward to you admitting only 10% of Welsh support independence for Wales. Not holding my breath though.
Good grief, even @guardian can't resist peddling tripe that Wales is moving toward independence. Wales says #nothanks http://t.co/80V8iPB5nB
.@adrianmasters84 no, very disappointingly no eggs or balloons. Everyone I met today was polite and welcoming and most were voting no.
Great day campaigning in Rutherglen for solidarity , jobs and social justice heta & across the whole UK. Back next week #indyref #nothanks
Well if Blantyre is anything to go by, Scotland will vote no next Thursday.  #indyref http://t.co/DMz6uslfOG
.@GarethCZ @IrregularShed every poll in Wales for the last 30 yrs shows suppprt for independence at around 10%
.@IrregularShed The overwhelming majority in Wales supports retaining the union and rejects Independence. Only 10% wants to break up Britain
Wales says Let's Stay Together! #Indyref http://t.co/Q78qXQofcL
In all seriousness, N Wales deserves better than to be embarrassed like this by its Tory representatives. http://t.co/nQR42iNqv4
@chrisshipitv An excellent idea, though it should be HS5, as HS4 should run from London/Heathrow to West Wales.

Brilliant speech by @Ed_Miliband  at #TUC14 - making the case, head and heart, for a United Kingdom and a radical Labour Government #indyref
@howieSwitchedOn I was at the NATO Summit, Howie, but remain opposed to puppy farms.
Don't know what was greater today: Tory no-shows' contempt for their leader, or Lib Dem turncoats' lack of integrity.
Glad we were able to vote once more against the Liberal-Tory bedroom tax. But it will take a Labour Govt. to rid us of it forever.
@frisby13 two-faced lib dems set to pretend they give a s*#! about the impact of the bedroom tax. How's that?
Heading back to London this morning to watch shameless Lib Dems vote to ameliorate the effects of the Bedroom Tax they passed. Contemptuous.

@GMBScotOrg As a #GMB member I'm proud we're calling for a No vote in the #indyref . I'll be with you again in the coming days #walessaysno
@soulesssniper er, the stated SNP policy to cut corporation tax and the refusal to reinstate the  50p income tax rate #nothanks
So, Scottish Tories think they'll lose in May & Salmond will cut tax for Big Biz and the rich. Vote No & Labour for a progressive Scotland.

@kirstynicho @RadioGuyGlasgow yes. We've been crystal clear. We will abolish it asap.
"@KarenClydach: Reacting to evidence and admitting a policy was wrong? U should try it." Hey Twitter, tell this yellow Tory what u think.

"@james_flynn: Fantastic article from the @DailyMirror act on it and register to vote! - http://t.co/ehSqeRhcKR" Agreed. Use it or lose it!
@gabundy absolutely, 140 characters is too few to address such a serious issue.

@saraloudav @gregalomaniac Hey Rob. I met on Tuesday with the new community group I've helped establish, bidding to run the Muni.
@davidcornock good grief. That's beyond the call. Sharing with a Tory. Even for a BBC man. You should submit a trauma claim.
.@FGW it was the 1915 from Paddington to Swansea, precisely. Didn't get the time at Didcot. Couldn't see the clock thru the crowd!
@gregalomaniac yeah. Should have thought of that.
.@FGW The one ressembling a sardine can hurtling between Didcot and Swindon. Only one person's fainted so far. Tell Sid.
@TS_Cym ah, up from 12 to 14% (+/-3%). In a poll primarily about Scottish independence (which showed massive Welsh support for The Union).
Stood up on heaving and roasting @FGW train (again) All the way to Swindon today. This privatisation lark is going well, isn't it?
@PontypriddPlaid @freedomforcelts the queation was do you support independence for Wales. 90% said no. Again.
.@TS_Cym @freedomforcelts which poll? Latest YouGov/ITV poll has support at 12% with a error margin of 3%,  6% said we'd be better off.
.@freedomforcelts Support for Welsh Independence is 10% on latest polling. As it was in 2001 and 1991. Uncomfortable truth for Nationalism.
@GeoffCripps @bellahardy no Geoff, I'd love to be supporting The Muni by attending the concert in Ponty, but I have to be in Parliament.
@MikeHannity I don't.  I think we could usefully devolve the licensing laws....just not in tine for kick off.

For all nationalists getting exercised tonight, let's be clear: I, along with most Welsh people, will wish England well in the World Cup 1/2

Having woken up voters in Trallwn, Trehafod and Hopkinstown, breakfast at Princes beckons, I reckon #TeamPonty #labourdoorstep
"@Bigandyclark: Thanks to @edballsmp @OwenSmithMP & @CPJElmore  for making the pizza I'm about to eat." I hesitate to ask...you feeling ok?
@EmyrYoung  er, no it hasn't. We're looking at how the community could run the Muni. That couldn't happen if the Council were still doing so
Is it me, or has John Humphrys turned off his 'angry bloke in the pub' mode when interviewing Farage? It's quite soothing, isn't it #r4Today
After sympathetically chuckling their way through the introduction to their 0810 eve-of-poll interview, @r4Today bowls long-hops to Farage

Great afternoon in #BarryBados with an irrepressible @edballsmp ....now down in Neyland ovelooking the Cleddau. #PembrokeshireLabour!
A Labour govt led by @Ed_Miliband will rebalance and grow our economy, so working people get a decent wage once more. Britain can do better.
@UnionJaxJoe @PontypriddRFC they always do. All over by half time! Move over Dragons,  Blues, Whoever!

@EmyrYoung @MickAntoniwAM yes. I hope so!
@EmyrYoung  Or more accurately: Tory-Liberal cuts force Labour Council to make sad decision, Labour MP proposes community transfer of asset.

.@DavidJonesMP's dark mutterings about Wales being "better off in a Free Trade Area" will only increase concern about EU investment in Wales
.@davidjonesmp has sowed yet more uncertainty about the future of the 1 in 7 Welsh jobs that depend on EU membership in #welshquestions
Brilliant turnout and even better reception on the #labourdoorstep in Hopkinstown with  @MickAntoniwAM & #teamponty http://t.co/qS8kTtoMNr"
"@NewStatesman: George Eaton appointed New Statesman political editor http://t.co/xwBQAD9NfF" congrats. Well deserved.
@dav_marsland @MickAntoniwAM @fightrct agreed
@dav_marsland @MickAntoniwAM @fightrct Yes. That's why we're taking parents to meet RCT on Friday.
The greatest team in the world @PontypriddRFC are cup champions once more #oleoleolepontyponty

@redflag3rd @MickAntoniwAM it's not raining, at least!
@P_JWally @BlaenauGwentMP @evrfc @PontypriddRFC I'll be there for sure. Hope it's not as tight as last year's cup game!

France would not stand by and let Pfizer gobble up Sanofi -but the Tories are cheering on the deal. What happened to 'march of the makers'
AZ will be a tax vehicle for Pfe if this deal goes ahead. Pfizer is a US Co.to its boots that will never change. I know, I worked for them
Under the Tories our Corp Tax rate ishalf that of the US - painting a target on the backs of our greatest companies #r4today
.@ChukaUmunna is totally right. Pfizer's takeover of AZ is not in Britain's interest. Pfizer sees Osborne's GB as a tax haven. #r4today
Labour launches European Election campaign http://t.co/0qLPCVE0TY
@CardiffPlaid nah, sorry to disappoint, pressed the button by accident. New phone and fat fingers. I was trying to find out the Ponty score.
Oh dear @SCrabbMP & @davidjonesmp don't understand their own Bill well enough to speak to it, hiding behind a Treasury shield. #taxistricky
@ArfonJ oh, I don't know, Arf, you are clearly hanging on my every word. BTW Speech is on p6 of yesterday's WMail & subject of the editorial
Final thought on great day for @PontypriddRFC Our club was a credit to Welsh rugby today: players, club, fans. I'm proud to be a part of it.
Slightly recovered now from today's disappointment(amazing what the prospect of 2 finals will do)Well done to @leinsterrugby :a great club
We was robbed. @PontypriddRFC

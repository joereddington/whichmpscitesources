@Planet_Pedro and naturally it was in #Maryhill! - really put a spring in our step when campaigning this afternoon.
So the truth is now out on planned #SNP cutbacks in #NHS -http://t.co/YF6xgemnn0

Lots of support for #LabourNo in #Patrick this morning. http://t.co/SlFitd2xmC

@GerryHassan the phrase "really bossing" is rarely used in conjunction with "informed democracy" and "reasoned argument".
Are we at Plan K yet on currency?  No use asking for mandate npbut can't describe the proposal. #bbcindyref
@faisalislam @UK_Together - SNP have always been poor at negotiation - a key weakness in SG performance.

AS has a very old fashioned view of why young people choose to work abroad - patronising to say they should work here instead. #ScotDecides
Have just arrived home - have we agreed that threat of an alien invasion is more likely than AS having a Plan B on currency? #ScotDecides
Some relief that UK government now accepting need to review £8bn of arms sales to Israel -http://t.co/HM6dnd6SJI via @guardian

@liberalstephen @labourpress rental levels still high c.f average incomes and many leases terminated by landlords before rent due for review
So the PM's response to the problems of #generationrent is to do absolutely nothing.
Our @CommonsBIS will be taking evidence on 13th from CEO's of #Pfizer and #AstraZeneca plus Trade Union reps.
Just raised the need in today's UQ for trade union reps to be properly consulted about the impact of any #AstraZeneca takeover bid.

Why didn't @theSNP support Labour's energy price freeze today? They'd rather side with big energy than Scottish families. #freezethatbill
@melspence2 @GeorgeFoulkes @bmc875  except LHA didn't reduce benefit for existing tenancies but bedroom tax does
One year on, the bedroom tax looks like costing more than it saves. Say you’re with us and help us scrap it - http://t.co/87934HO3t4

Asked Government at #BIS questions today to legislate to prevent exploitation of #zerohours contracts now that about 1m workers now affected
@kilmacolm1 @theSNP so they can reveal their true blue low tax vision - only Labour seriously committed to redistributing wealth.
@burdzeyeview and if a #yes vote to be replaced by a Scottish govt. that has failed all of its own equality targets on public bodies posts?
@royalsoced a lame and overused excuse when there are over 2.5m women in the country!
@royalsoced invite me to an event on "Enlightening the constitutional debate" with an all male 6 member panel -#notveryenlightened
A very sad day in #Scottish legal history as one of our unique protections is removed by a nationalist administration - bitter irony
Collective amnesia from the #YES side about the Financial Reporting Council requirement on companies to report any new significant factors.
#ATOS confirm to M.P.'s today that backlog of #PIP cases not likely to disappear until Q2  2015-underestimated no. with multiple conditions!

2) approx. £30bn so where do the balance of funds go if Scotland separates as savers try to preserve their tax exemption? #indyref
1) Treasury confirm that in 2013, #Scottish based #ISA providers account for £75.4bn- 17% of UK total held but Scot residents only hold ..
There is only one Plan B on #currency and it's high risk for everyone whether you have debts or savings -http://t.co/amFKbODrjs
Today the #indyref currency argument stopped being a technocratic debate and is now about what the interest rate will be on your debt?

David Willetts makes clear that a post separation Scotland would have to fund all its own #University research.

@kieran_wild @Askinner2011 they were only 3% apart in 2010 and Tory vote has been increasing slightly at recent Scottish by-elections.

Good meeting today with @BIA_UK looking at finance, links with NHS and need to support start-ups post Catapult intervention.
At #DCMS questions today asked for both UK and Scottish govts to support @GlasgowCC call for greater powers to curb clusters of #bookies.
@bmc875 @jruddy99 @D_G_Johnson good to see you implicitly admit that the case for staying together is now stronger
@bmc875 @D_G_Johnson I am old enough to remember the days when the SNP couldn't wait to drop the UK pound and "be free" -#sayanything

At #PMQs, PM in reply to my question on high risk #helptobuy now appears to shifting responsibility to Bank of England -does Carney agree?
Another day of debate on the thoroughly bad #LobbyingBill - hoping we can secure some amendments but it deserves to be binned entirely.
@SharmanPrince - yes but we voted on this debate last week! Unfortunately despite majority in support, Govt. have failed to accept call.
@ericclyne1 @cathyjamieson gave very clear steer of Labour's frontbench position in winding up at both last night's and today's debate.
Spoke in a second #payday lending debate this morning to ask that new trade levy is utilised for more free financial/debt advice services.
Just spoken in #payday lending debate - with around 100k in #Glasgow using high cost credit, public protection should be paramount.

Early start this morning to thank all our super post workers at @RoyalMail in Maryhill as we approach Xmas. http://t.co/p8N32UuVDZ
@UCUGlasgow and watching the rather awkward attempts by the city fathers who felt duty bound to follow his dancing!
I'll never forget standing in a very wet George Sq when #Mandela first visited Glasgow - a truly wonderful day in our city's history. RIP
The Treasury's biggest success today- no, not the #AutumnStatement but the announcement of the likely death of IDS's #universal credit prog
George Osborne's repeated mention of #sunshine in the #AutumnStatement is particularly unconvincing.
Great privilege to speak tonight at #WorldAIDSDay community service for #Glasgow at St.Mary's Cathedral and to meet staff from @WaverleyCare
Just spotted shocking story re helicopter crash at #Clutha Bar tonight - thoughts with all affected.
Goldman Sachs today say #RoyalMail shares worth 610p but told Govt. too risky to sell >330p #firesalefroth
The Latest News From Jeff Randall Live http://t.co/CVGS1Nra1c
Will be giving my views on today's @CommonsBIS hearing on #royalmailshares on @SkyNewsBiz with Jeff Randall around 7pm tonight.
Quite astonishing that Vince Cable couldn't tell @CommonsBIS if, when and on what criteria #RoyalMail sale bonus would be paid to  advisors
Try to picture the scene as the #SG try to justify their threat to default on their share of UK debt to the board of the IMF #emptyrhetoric
@Markfergusonuk but still failing to confirm their own legal advice on the issue...hmm
Looking forward to #Scottish Govt. explaining why it agreed to sale of #student loan book to a debt collection company-#movingtotheright
@andrew_haddow it would be hard to find a better case for an exception to the rule regardless of your views on #indyref.
Wonder if SG #indyref White Paper will publish their legal advice on EU membership? At 700 pages shouldn't be difficult to find space.
Thanks to doctors and staff at #Maryhill health centre for stimulating discussion on impact of welfare reforms/ economic conditions locally.
Hoping to speak this pm in debate on the annual #Arms Export Control committee report about sales to #Syria and #Surveillance equipment.
Another quick plug for my article on the need for #transparency in the extractive industry sector -

Good to hear from my colleague @curranstephen speaking at Westminster today about children's rights project in #Glasgow with @UNICEF_uk.
My comments on the increasing use of mass #surveillance systems sold by private companies - http://t.co/2xpqDASiKv
A sad day with the loss of the lovely gentle @HelenEadie007 - thoughts and prayers with family.
Here's my take in #HuffPostUK on this week's debate on #payday lending - http://t.co/WpIGuOwVI3
Good to see growing cross party support at both Westminster and Holyrood for #LivingWageWeek http://t.co/w6VCGncKWg
Speaking this morning at breakfast meeting to support National Bookkeeping Week here in #Glasgow.
We're on the side of the consumer claims Energy Minister Gregory Barker but he won't #freezethatbill!
Great fireworks display on the Thames compensating for transport chaos caused by Parliament sq demo. http://t.co/jUg30lUVfo
@ITVLauraK @itvnews sheer coincidence that they are before out @CommonsBIS tomorrow?
Action not words needed to close gap - Young Women In Low Paid Jobs Triples In 20 Years, Warns TUC http://t.co/wOSYEWPfTu via @HuffPostUK
#payday lending under the microscope tomorrow at our @CommonsBIS  with Wonga, @MartinSLewis , FCA and @joswinson all giving evidence.
Today at #Defence Q's asked Govt to have clear strategy on recruiting women and BME community to our Reserves.
Still dancing here at @maryhill_halls gala dinner - traditional tango followed by Mama Mia!
Arrived back from lively @ScottishFabians AGM and now a quick change to head out to @maryhill_halls gala dinner - #notaquietsaturday
At Foreign Office Q's have requested Govt to urgently review #UKTI business advice on investing in settlements in #Palestinian territory.
Deeply concerned about downgrading threat to Glasgow North rail service -will be strongly campaigning against move -http://t.co/oyhEdYbNHH
In Home Office Q's today stressed need 4 EU to develop common strategy on helping #Syrian refugees - Home Sec confirmed talks are
occurring
@greenmsps @andywightman except European legal systems are v. different from our own.Any evidence current balance of probability test flawed
Delighted to support #makeadifferenceday along with @DrewSm1th joining staff and volunteers @barnardos in Glasgow. http://t.co/8uvVZuCBYh
@UnisonDave wonder if #Vince Cable will accuse them of talking "fluff'!
Many congratulations to @cara_hilton and our hardworking @scottishlabour team for a great result in #Dunfermline.
Good to meet up today with young @RNIB members from Scotland popping in to watch PMQ's
@s28mcf a 20mth price freeze for customers plus significant reform of energy markets to ensure transparency on costs
Good to be out with our great team of @LabourStudents in wet #Dunfermline today but now looking forward to relaxing bath and dry clothes!
Looks like DPM has had to swallow Salmond/Swinney agenda of low tax economy to help big business rather than tackle market fail in #energy.
So the #SNP solution to energy costs crisis is to cut levies on energy companies and hope money goes to consumers rather than to dividends?!
Thanks to @FMcKillop and other #ABCUL colleagues for excellent presentation today on how we can extend credit unions services locally.
Congratulations to fellow Paisley born parliamentarian @EleanorLaingMP on her appointment today as Deputy Speaker.
@DavidPBMaddox because taxpayers money from all over UK is being used for this rather than being spent on more social housing! It's crazy!
Packed cross party meeting  to support launch of @PaulBlomfieldMP Charter to stop #payday loan rip-off.
Please join me in supporting tougher regulation of high cost credit - sign the Charter at http://t.co/SU5v2gKUGg
@kdugdalemsp @MalcolmChishol1 @JennyMarra also the recommendation of Commons BIS committee in the summer but #SNP appear as deaf as Tories!
Delighted to support the #HERinHERO campaign @LadyGeek to encourage more girls into technical careers http://t.co/wgsqkfDANF
I receive an invite to launch of Technical Academy Scotland with an all MALE speaker panel inc @GeorgeAdam - oh dear #19thcenturyScotland
After the share price surge on #royalmail wonder if Vince Cable's defence of its real estate value by its in-house co. will be as "spot on"?
@Irpicus @John4Govan congratulations on a hard fought campaign and a super new councillor for #sunnyGovan!
“@PickardJE: Royal Mail shares: Rebecca O’Keeffe of Interactive Investor said more than half of those in a survey planned to sell quickly.”
Excellent programme on @BBC2 now with @DanSnowcouk about history of #Congo.
Sadly Government is still deaf to criticism of #gagginglaw so we now await the Lords scrutiny - suspect further concessions will be offered.
Prime Minster sounding more and more like the PR guy for the major energy companies #pmqs
According to #royalmail prospectus Pg 32 para. 1.38, they can't quantify impact of #indyref - more Q's for @vincecable at @CommonsBIS @ 2.30
@nalmousawi @henryfcwilson @kccasting-I'll continue to vote against #gagginglaw but this pm will be questioning @vincecable on #royalmail
Deeply honoured to have been unanimously selected as @scottishlabour candidate in #Glasgow North constituency for 2015 General Election.
Our @CommonsBIS taking evidence tomorrow from @vincecable about #royalmail sale - expect close questioning on share price/asset values.
@CommonsBIS is tackling the tricky subject of reforming #consumer rights today -reminds me of some of my law lectures when I was a teenager!
@GerryBraiden @burdzeyeview @COSLA if it has the excellent @PamLDuncan as a member it certainly won't be dull or insipid.
Thanks to staff and volunteers at #Riding for Disabled Association at Summerston for hosting lovely visit this week. http://t.co/axfy9G0gAR
Worthwhile noting referendum this week in Ireland where public were totally disengaged in political obsession about constitution #apathyarc
@davidtorrance - visited Dublin last week and even the placards had some very confused messaging! http://t.co/67ZMkeYAv2
@Dem_Tilly @huxley06 @PME2013 @andyburnhammp If they live in Scotland they should contact their local MSP - happy to provide info if they DM
@TheFCA Given the tens of thousands of individual transactions and the lack of independent real time recording there's still space for abuse
How is @TheFCA  going to monitor use of CPA's by #payday lenders and why have they swallowed industry pressure to retain them?
Why isn't @TheFCA insisting on real time recording for #payday lenders when most of the major companies already have to do so in N.America?
@paullewismoney absolutely no good reason why industry should not be forced to have real time recording - already working in North America.
Huge number of #Scottish Pakistan community at #Glasgow Emirates tonight to welcome new Governor of Punjab - Mohammad Sarwar.
Great news for #Maryhill-Craig Clark @ClydeSpace  has secured more space satellite orders and recruiting extra staff. http://t.co/AT7iRisWQH

Good day campaigning in sunny Dunfermline with @cara_hilton and @FionaODonnellMP and team @scottishlabour.
@ianssmart @greggmcclymont I'm struck by the fact that they ignore the alternative of funding measures to increase life expectancy!
Finished our @scottishlabour morning campaigning with @johnkane4govan with a visit to the historic #Fairfield shipyard HQ.
Best of luck to all those taking part in #carrotnightwalk in #Glasgow tonight. http://t.co/A2V43oSNZY

Hearing #thebigdebate on @BBCScotland did ask for and got senior #Labour rep but then turned them down at last minute - why?!
I'm suffering from a bad technology week - printer, PC, office phones have all malfunctioned and now smartphone appears corrupted-#techfail
An entertaining, informative and politically neutral take on the #indyref Big Money Question via ESRC -http://t.co/sF497srJ7a
Recent parliamentary answers show #Scottish Govt have made NO representations on proposed fiscal regime for #shalegas- #cannottbefracked
Good discussion at roundtable today with @jrf_uk and #DEMOS about risks of poverty for those with long term mental health conditions.
Pleased to support the #Breast Cancer #wearitpink campaign this year. http://t.co/GWaPdEHjMj
@ianssmart - might have asked FM why his Govt. made no representations on issue to UK Govt! - http://t.co/Kn5c9vhNHf
@McDawg thanks for feedback!
I presume @kevinmckenna49 in his Observer article missed the recent #Ashcroft polling showing increasing support in Scotland for #UKIP?
In one week, RICS, Vince Cable and now the Bank of England fear a housing bubble -so why is Govt. continuing with mortgage guarantee
scheme?

Another day on the #Lobbying Bill finished tonight with many unanswered questions - read my latest blog. http://t.co/dATDa87V3e
@Mary_Galbraith many congratulations on your selection! Well deserved.
Well deserved! RT“@KevinJBuchanan: Agnes Tolmie from UNITE receiving Women's Gold badge #tuc13 http://t.co/Ql5V5UkxL8”
Today in #LobbyingBill debate I raised concern that right of voluntary orgs to speak on #indyref debate could be seriously restricted.
At #Treasury Q's, minister is completely evasive about addressing risk of house price inflation with the #mortgage guarantee scheme.
@RealMacKaySTV Is she pausing until the #indyref?
It's now time for Govt. to confirm identity of companies involved in export of chemicals to #Syria from UK so we can properly assess risks.
Arms Exports Control Comm asks Govt. to explain key discrepancies on statements regarding chemical exports to #Syria -http://t.co/iu4o8chjRB
My response to #Syria's arms suppliers at UK Arms Fair-http://t.co/JcuQMwzxrU Arms Fair-
@tomgreatrexmp and even more Belgians at #Heathrow! Sorry to hear of train woes.
Asked at #DCMS Q's today that Govt. ensure all areas in #Glasgow do not miss out in securing broadband access.
Tomorrow at #DCMS questions I hope to highlight why lack of broadband access is not solely a rural problem but also for poorer urban areas.
@EddieBarnes23 @MorayMacdonald you mean there are some PR people who don't know that Glasgow is the UK's top conference location choice?!
@ianssmart @C_Stihler_MEP - the fact this issue is now running into a second year is a real indictment on #SG's attitude to FOI/transparency
As #Wonga announces an eyewatering increase in profits here is my take on the #payday lending sector -http://t.co/xHlLGlMWsa
@_kittybitty @henryfcwilson @scottishlandsca @AnabelMarsh - Labour will be voting against very flawed Lobbying Bill tonight at 2nd reading.
Gordon Brown today effectively destroyed the #SNP argument for a fiscal pact but convincingly showed sharing resources throughout UK is key.
After last night's dramatic #Syria vote you do have to wonder why Govt. wish to spend next 2 weeks debating a heavily flawed #LobbyingBill
Many stunned faces on both sides after Govt's defeat -P.M. totally failed to understand extent of concerns about risk of escalating conflict
@ADBremner As the Deputy FM is not promising any answers until 2016 I think you will hear about Labour's policies for the UK a lot earlier
Hearing that #indyref White Paper will NOT include policy on welfare despite it being obviously a key issue to majority of voters - #YESfail
As constituents who contacted me will have noted debate on #Syria is changing rapidly but I will be writing to all shortly.
@tomgreatrexmp what role are you taking in the show?
Met a young mum today who told me her employer is being very awkward as she comes to end of her maternity leave but Govt. lessens her rights

Summer surgery this morning with @DrewSm1th at 11am in Cafe Tiki at RNIB offices, Partick - all welcome.
@dhothersall or #shockingwasteofmoneygate?
@TomHarrisMP @YesScotland @JoeJFagan - you are being too rational!
@TomHarrisMP @YesScotland @JoeJFagan - you think it was helpful?! Some very odd judgement calls all round in this episode.
#changingGlasgow - city centre mobile phone shop tells me they now have 3 mandarin speaking staff members due to growing #Chinese community.

@GeorgeFoulkes perhaps they are going to start a shift system!
Thanks to all at #Glasgow Credit Union for excellent discussion today on how to provide ethical lending solutions.

Thanks to all the staff @quarriers N.W. Carers Centre for warm welcome and chance to find out more abou their new services in local area.
2....would UK taxpayers be subsidising foreign buyers who already have owned property in UK? #howtocreateapropertycasinomarket
1. #BBC reports that foreign buyers with no history of property owning in the UK will be excluded from #Mortgage guarantee scheme but why..
@ITVLauraK will be fascinated to know how they can verify borrower has no 2nd home - suspect they can only ask applicant to give warranty
Why are the #Scottish Govt. so disinterested in #RoyalMail privatisation and impact on jobs? - http://t.co/zbNUfkMEVW

"@UKParliament: Committee publish report on Scrutiny of Arms Exports and Arms Control (2013) http://t.co/pBZ8Yl1P6m"-worth reading!
Pleased that Justine Greening at today's #DFID questions shares my concern about lack of cross border access for NGO's in #Syria.
@HouseofCommons #Arms Export Control committee annual report will be published at midnight- lots of fascinating details about scale of sales
Almost an hour to get from Paddington to Vauxhall and still not home -@Tfl  not at its best tonight
Bus has now been put on diversion via Kensington in completely wrong direction to where I want to go! #unexpectedplaces home by midnight?
Stuck in a very hot bus in a dire traffic jam at Oxford Circus at 10.50 on a Sunday night! #tiredandsticky.
Part of literal kitchen sink drama this afternoon when neighbour's pipe burst - massively relieved when plumber arrived! #soaked
Thanks to my colleague @PaulBlomfieldMP for all his hard work on #High Cost Credit Bill and hope Govt will change to support in autumn.

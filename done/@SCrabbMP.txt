Welsh Labour cant make up its mind whether to admit that the economy is growing & unemployment falling. Confused on the big picture.
Welsh Lab (Cardiff) now changed tune on jobs and say they welcome growth. Welsh Lab (westminster) still in denial and say new jobs="mirage"
This is an economic recovery for all the UK. Strong jobs growth now in Wales as business confidence increases.Unemployment now below UK rate
Very good Wales jobs figures today. Unemployment rate here falling faster than any other UK region/nation. 12,000 fewer jobless over last Q.

@dylanjonesevans They tried to trash the independent ONS stats. Amazing. Wont accept that good things happening in Wales
We shldnt forget: behind the jobs stats are real lives. People returning to work, getting new skills & opportunities. Our top priority
Bizarre response from Welsh Lab MPs in Grand Committee to the jobs figures today. Denying there is a jobs recovery in Wales.
Really good jobs figures for Wales again today. Economic inactivity at record low. Employment level at record high. Youth unemplymnt falling
Over the last year, the employment rate in wales increased by 2.5% - largest rise out of all the UK regions/nations
Welsh Lab MPs have been biggest champions of 'Plan B' wanting more spending & borrowing. Argued against return to financial discipline.
Welsh Grand Cttee today discussing the economy against backdrop of steady recovery. Will Welsh Lab MPs still call for more borrowing & debt?
Appalled at SCBU closure.Welsh Gov ignoring rural communities & putting lives at risk.Will do all I can to overturn decision @SaveWithybush

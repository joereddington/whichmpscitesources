@btp67 Thank you, best wishes
@claret_rain Actually that's one of the groups we do best with
@claret_rain So instead we should tell you honestly what our priorities are, and for me childcare and early years is near the top
@claret_rain This news is going to hit hard, but yes - it is true that there is not enough money for politicians to promise you everything
@claret_rain Call me an old socialist, but I think the funding should go to where it's most needed. And that is childcare and early years
@claret_rain Better childcare benefits everyone, reduces inequality, improves life chances. Clear to me it should be the priority
@claret_rain It would be wrong to scrap tuition fees - that would be an inequitable transfer to the wealthy. Childcare is where £ should go
@claret_rain It is if you understand them. These are real world policies, not gimmicks
@claret_rain We will ban them where they mandate an employee to work exclusively for one employer
#6monthstowin to end the bedroom tax, increase childcare, protect a public NHS, freeze energy prices, ban zero hours and more. Let's do it
@markmccarrick1 Thanks, I'd appreciate that
@markmccarrick1 Oh dear. I am sorry if there has been an error somewhere. I would be happy to arrange to see you whenever best for you

@markmccarrick1 I received a green card (but from a different person) only at 8pm that evening. I have since been in touch with them
@markmccarrick1 But if you are a constituent and were in HoC you should have arranged to see me. I would have loved to have seen you

Here’s Why A Bunch Of People Are Shouting “PARKLIFE!” At Russell Brand On The Internet http://t.co/AwN1nInIpJ via @aljwhite @buzzfeed
@PlatformLondon Now that really is nonsense
@SighthillGorgie Strongly agree... sounds like a strong case for the UK ;o)
@SighthillGorgie But you still need some demand for it. Unless you want a common energy market, but that's an argument for the existing UK
@SighthillGorgie But on storage breakthroughs are happening. Again though, it will require there to be a market for it to take off
@SighthillGorgie If you want to supply other countries interconnectors are how you do it
@SighthillGorgie Because otherwise the interconnector will flow the other way, and import rather than export
@SighthillGorgie you'll produce electricity that will be consistently cheaper than the country you want to supply.
@SighthillGorgie and that is much harder to do in a smaller country, with less bill layers and less subsidy. Plus it's hard to guarantee >
@SighthillGorgie But to supply more than Scotland needs, through interconnection, you have to first build the renewable capacity
@SighthillGorgie Seems to miss big issue of Scotland's supply already exceeding its demand, so independence takes away market for new gen
@sighthillgorgie Says a Scottish Green, who were prepared to sacrifice the Scottish renewables industry for a hydrocarbon economy
@sighthillgorgie @platformlondon Probably because I'm right
@BateMaryb I agree with recall for misconduct, but political decisions should be subject to view of all constituents at General Elections

@qprdave1234 Same is true of leaving people vulnerable to volatility of gas and oil though. Low carbon + greater efficiency best way to go
@qprdave1234 UK has one of the least efficient housing stocks in Europe, and the worst fuel poverty as a result
@qprdave1234 And - we intend to insulate those homes to modern standards so whatever the unit cost of heat, people will need less of it

@MattBonsall It would have empowered small groups and well-financed interests. 5% does not equal 'the people'
@MattBonsall Or against people willing to stand up for minorities, e.g. with equal marriage bill last year
@MattBonsall This would have been used against those people willing to stand up to the powerful, or to special interests, just like in US
@MattBonsall That's exactly what I mean. I think people thought this was a left wing proposal when it was quite the opposite
@MattBonsall Sad to hear that, but the kind of right-wing politics it would have facilitated is just not what I'm about

@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews Not on a Tuesday unofrtunately, but it does look good
@MWLEvents @SBTownTeam @stalyhandmade Drop me an email about this pls
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews Got to exempt key UK public services, e.g. NHS, but could be very beneficial if got right
Finally getting round to watching Boardwalk Empire. Like a fantastic crossover between the Sopranos and Downton Abbey
@TheBeardyGuy Harder to explain support for totalitarian regimes, with inc fuel poverty home I think, but just my view
@TheBeardyGuy Plus don't forget the heat problem
@TheBeardyGuy I don't think so. It's a choice of whether we're happy with gas from Qatar (or Russia), or if there are better options
@TheBeardyGuy higher
@TheBeardyGuy That's one of the reasons I like them so much. Even in a world of cheap gas, short run marginal costs of gas plants would be >
@TheBeardyGuy But the key thing is - the short run marginal costs for renewables, once construction costs are paid off, are practically zero
@TheBeardyGuy Even the very big coal users like China also have huge renewable programmes
@TheBeardyGuy It looks like a bit of a straw man to me. I don't know of any countries solely proposing shale as a way to reduce emissions
@TheBeardyGuy It looks like an analysis of global energy policy rather than UK or European
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews It can only be utilised if there are gas plants to put it into. Plus gas could never be cheaper than the wind...
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews UK shale unlikely to be sufficient to alter Euro gas prices like we've seen in US I'd say
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews We favour a legal decarbonisation target for energy mix, so renewables and nuclear essential to deliver that
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews and there is the issue of heat - domestic gas boilers are 85% of market so gas will feature for quite a while
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews so question is where should that gas come from. Plus unabated coal is the main priority to get out of the mix
@TheBeardyGuy @rowenanews No-one (except maybe Govt) sees shale as route to greener future, but gas will be part of mix for a while >

If a DWP Minister has said disabled people should not be paid the minimum wage, then they should resign #PMQs

@ChrisStaly Me too
@McDermottQC Yes, charities too - some ridiculous levels of top pay
@McDermottQC Strongly agree. Lord Sainsbury has a good section on the absurdity of renumeration consultants in his book. I'll look into this
@McDermottQC That is obscene. Is that basic salary or some sort of elaborate remuneration package?
@MikeHalley That's the UK energy app, data comes from Elexon
@TheBeardyGuy I would be if I was there, but I'll be in constituency. Labour are voting in favour though
@TheBeardyGuy Good to chat. Those National Grid scenarios are available in a good booklet if you're interested in energy/climate policy
@TheBeardyGuy is for 78 GW of renewables plus 9 GW nuclear by 2030, so not a choice of choosing between them or nuclear being dominant
@TheBeardyGuy We do. National Grid do very detailed work on this which is publicly available and v good - their greenest 2030 scenario >
@TheBeardyGuy Indeed but again that still requires nuclear in the mix. No country has decarbonised without it
@TheBeardyGuy There's lots happening on that, but it doesn't exist yet and we need to commission new generation now
The by-elections show Labour can be confident of election victory http://t.co/qbhv8cD8Dw
Brilliant to be in Ashton today with @gwynnemp to support launch of @angelarayner's campaign. She'll be fantastic http://t.co/B0XBkoQ2MN
@TheBeardyGuy Even if that happened you would still need nuclear in the mix to help mitigate intermittency
@TheBeardyGuy Very unlikely on that timescale. Renewables like tidal will need more support than nuclear, and for similar length of contract
@TheBeardyGuy All new energy generation is subsidised via energy bills, inc wind, solar etc. Makes case for efficiency even more compelling
@TheBeardyGuy @LabourParty Yes - nuclear is an essential part of the energy mix if we're to tackle climate change

@MeltonBlue There you go again... Len McCluskey was actually elected by 144,570 votes #bighandful
@MeltonBlue Yes, the likely end of a Tory Govt and election of a Labour one is good news for all trade unionists. Happy to clarify that
@MeltonBlue You just tweeted me to attack @LMcInnes_Labour for being a trade unionist. That's how this exchange started, about 5 mins ago
@MeltonBlue @Paul_Burgin @LMcInnes_Labour @halfon4harlowMP @Tara_Hewitt which only makes your total hostility towards them even more stupid
@MeltonBlue @Paul_Burgin @LMcInnes_Labour The modern Tory position of total hostility to anyone in a trade union is absolutely crackers
Delighted for @LMcInnes_Labour, who will be a brilliant MP for Heywood and Middleton
@McDermottQC Actually much of next election will be decided in North West - seats like Bury North, Lancaster, Morecambe, Pendle, Rossendale

@Barters Yeah it was damn good too. Sadly an early morning meeting means I won't be going on to 5th Avenue
Brilliant to join my old Labour Club @manclabourstudents for a curry tonight. Good to see we're still the best Labour Club in the country
@EnergiewendeGER Strong reasons for that in Germany, but in UK public unlikely to accept rising emissions and rising energy prices
@johnfbroderick That sounds LOVELY. Drop me an email to arrange
@doug_parr Nuclear, wind, tidal all have considerable cost, but are worth it to tackle climate change (+ energy security, air quality etc)
@powellds Yes I'd love to see that
@powellds Yes absolutely - I think Germany has some very favourable context for that which unfortunately would be hard to replicate in UK
@powellds Danger is if you raise energy prices as they have, but don't reduce emissions, you risk losing public support which is key
@doug_parr Agree. But I think they're also proof nuclear is required as part of the mix if tackling emissions is priority it should be
@doug_parr But surely very disappointing their emissions are going up?

@andykirkland71 but my mind is open on it - I just don't think it's true that all our problems would be sorted just by nationalising it all
@andykirkland71 because a lot of the problems around rolling stock etc stem from under-investment under nationalisation
@andykirkland71 Genuine answer, for all the probs of present system, is I worry we'd do badly from a BR-style renationalisation

The @oxfamgb @christian_aid and @CAFOD climate fringe with @sunny_hundal and @Mark_Goldring1 also great #lab14highlights
Some #Lab14 highlights - both the @ProgressOnline and @serauk rallies, which were brilliant

@LostTransport @anna_stanford @thedancingflea That is not the correct situation at all
@moobeshbutton There would be no implications for existing schools
@LostTransport @anna_stanford @thedancingflea This is not the view of National Grid, who know quite a bit about this
@moobeshbutton Our plan is to have a new Director of Schools Standards who will be able to commission new schools
@moobeshbutton Hi. We won't be opening any more free schools
Great stuff from Ed on decarbonisation target, GIB borrowing and our war on cold homes #Lab14
Fantastic @PRASEG and @SEA_Social fringe just now - standing room only. Apols for leaving early but looking forward to @Ed_Miliband's speech

Brilliant @serauk rally tonight at #Lab14 - standing room only and shadow ministers queuing up to speak

Caroline Flint: Labour pledges to insulate five million draughty homes http://t.co/8yujiQzLvU via @guardian
@kohnadeh @ProgressOnline Thank you
But being able to go home to my own bed in Stalybridge makes #Lab14 particularly brilliant (2/2)
Great day at #Lab14. Spoke at excellent events with @younglabourUK, @ProgressOnline  and @ippr (1/2)
Lovely climate-themed address by Ruth Valerio at the @chrleft service this morning
#Lab14 about to begin. On my way in to the @ChrLeft church service
@GreendealAIA Yes anything you send to me is very useful for getting across how difficult things have got
@GreendealAIA Thanks Colin, we are pressing them hard though there seems to be an alternate reality in DECC at times
“@hydefclive: FULL TIME HERE, HYDE 5 - LOWESTOFT 1” > Easy easy
Brilliant stuff @hydefclive. The tide has turned #winning
@jameshaslam78 It would probably rank as one of most successful seasons..
Has any team ever gone the whole season drawing every match? #safc
@HomEnergyAdvice @STindale Thanks guys - keep an eye on Labour Conf this week for more news from us
@JeffGazzard @ChukaUmunna @adamboultonSKY I've just responded positively to a request from constituents to attend a public meeting on this
@JeffGazzard @SkyNewsTonight @ChukaUmunna @adamboultonSKY Here in Greater Manchester there is a big appetite for more autonomy
@MissMossley Once after a school visit, a little boy went home and told his parents Prince William had been to his school
@MissMossley Brilliant
@kate_librarian I had a great time. Brilliant kids
Went on a great visit to Milton St John's school in Mossley today, where they gave me a school dinner and let me join the school council...
Brilliant visit to @News_ASC today where they've just had a major refurbishment. Really good things happening there http://t.co/Dnxw9uRh1s
Reynolds' Round Up - Scottish referendum special - http://t.co/ADO999Z5sb
@andybolton Agree. And we should stop closing schools on polling day - they should be part if it all
86% turnout. Incredible. And Salmond is right about 16 and 17 year olds #indyref
Love you Scotland
@DRLT It was a really ranty speech. I think he was trying to make his mark. He was never heard of again
@DRLT I was in Crowtree the night of the 1997 election and the losing Tory's speech literally took longer than the count
@DRLT Indeed. Though I've always wondered if they just make it up and no-one really cares that much
@lynbrownmp Full constituency day tomorrow - and we've a byelection up here too!
Off to bed. As I heard a wise man say during the campaign, whatever the result tomorrow, you'll all still be Scots #indyref
I wonder how long before the first: 'indyref proves my own world view is entirely correct' articles appear? I'd say a matter of hours...
Proud of my old mate @blairmcdougall - remarkably energetic interview on @SkyNews right now even though he must be knackered #indyref
@barnardos Of course, that's no problem at all
@DaveyWhitehead I haven't seen it - what's the story..?
It's not all #indeyref today! Brilliant to be out in Heywood & Middleton with our excellent candidate Liz McInnes http://t.co/da9MbLcD6l
A moment's silence to remember events of two years ago. Memory of that day still affects me greatly #fiona #nicola http://t.co/x6YlGH0IyL
Remembering two brave @gmpolice officers who lost their lives defending us two years ago today. Never forgotten #nicola #fiona
@TartanAndTweed No odds to me if Shetland goes independent
I love the Daily Mirror #indyref http://t.co/OGXY9AqPHE
@KJButler13 @BEAMASmartGrid Okay I'll check if I can do that and let you know
@KJButler13 @BEAMASmartGrid I'd certainly like to come... Hopefully without my passport :0)
It would be hard not to smile at someone launching the 'It's Shetland's Oil' campaign after tomorrow #indyref
Shetland may reconsider its place in Scotland after yes vote, says Carmichael http://t.co/pCDhiqu5QV #indyref
A snapshot from our #bettertogether phonebank tonight. Fighting for every vote #labourno #indyref http://t.co/plFUbdUZb9
@Conorpope Unfortunately I've got a full constituency Friday... Is there a premium service whereby @Markfergusonuk personally rings you?
What's everyone's #indyref result strategy? I'm thinking early to bed then a 4am rise on Friday - result around 5am?
Only very rarely do you hear a speech that makes your spine tingle. This is one of those speeches: https://t.co/K7Y4UJw6Ho #indyref
“@MENnewsdesk: Council bosses to study plan to move Parliament to Manchester http://t.co/6YsCH7adEP” > YES TO THIS
@patrickharvie @sunny_hundal But Patrick it's surely much harder to support renewables in iScotland than in a UK-wide energy market?
@elderflower79 Yes we need more interconnection and that's where relationship would be, but rUK CfDs and cap market wouldn't be available
“@JenWilliamsMEN: Brilliant....Breaking nudes: Audience get FULL Full Monty @palaceandopera http://t.co/D8pn7SdWTh” > brilliant
@elderflower79 Which is why breaking up UK on the back of oil obsession, but expense of renewables, is such a depressing prospect
@elderflower79 Hinckley is a UK power station. There would be no practical or reasonable way rUK could commission generation in iScotland
@doug_parr I was thinking exactly the same!
@doug_parr Indeed but I can't see rUK taxpayers wanting to subsidise projects in other countries
@doug_parr Crucial issue has to be how independence would harm Scottish renewables industry, as rUK market is removed
@jameshaslam78 With the exception of fringe elements like EDL, we're lucky to have no experience of political violence in the UK (until now)
Abuse, violence, intimidation. Is this Salmond's Scotland? #indyref
Great to catch up with @nmcinroy this morn. Big changes needed in UK governance whatever result of #indyref on Thurs
@LukemCresswell Where is that statistic from? I cannot see anyway that could be true
@1999wilbur Who knows. We have no idea what EU situation would be, or dual nationality issue, or borders, currency etc etc
@smithROH1 Elections are trivial compared to the need to unite Scotland after this. Legacy of bitterness and division will be hard
@RuairidhIrwin Nothing at all - that's the whole basis of the #bettertogether campaign
@CaitlinBruce_xo But you understand a similar graph for London would show exactly the same thing?
@CaitlinBruce_xo It really doesn't show that. It certainly shows British General elections tend to be decisive, but not much else
@CaitlinBruce_xo What this graph actually shows is that Scotland quite often gets what it votes for
@CaitlinBruce_xo The North East of England, for instance, has got the Govt it voted for on far fewer times than Scotland
@CaitlinBruce_xo That's ridiculous! The graph to look at would be how Scotland voted v the Govt it ended up with
@CaitlinBruce_xo But this twice in a 100 years thing is obviously wrong?
@CaitlinBruce_xo What exactly do you mean by this? In 2005, 2001,1997 Scotland got the Govt it voted for, and many more times if you go back
@RuairidhIrwin Indeed, but the problem is you can't have any of these things you like after separation. That's what separation is
@YishanArshed I think we can agree the USA has it's own currency, energy security, border control etc

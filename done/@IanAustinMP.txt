@kingofgrump Thanks for this: we've talked to police and council about it
.@richardksmith Not ignoring anything & not a lie to say Farage proposed bringing in insurance-based healthcare.  http://t.co/gDCNhL7vCC
Has @richardksmith got nothing better to do but send me strange messages? Is he getting a bit obsessed?
@kingofgrump Steady on. I'm in London for the NHS vote, but I've been trying to find out for you and others.
@AndyUpNorth he is the leader! It says a lot about his instincts and views. Anyway, up to the public to make up their minds
@AndyUpNorth Of course he can have an opinion. And of course I can draw attention to it
@emmersonslaw A vote winner? Why are they so sensitive about it then?
@stokelad84 says quite a lot about his instincts and views
UKIP supporters seem very sensitive about me having temerity to highlight Farage proposing insurance-based healthcare http://t.co/gDCNhL7vCC
Earlier today I told the government to stop local police station closures. 500 signatures against, pls add your name https://t.co/1vSCGY2u7B

@james2288 We'll see. I take nothing for granted. Not up to me. And not up to you. Good idea not to declare result until game's over
@MarkFoxNews. Thanks!
@james2288 I think you'll find that's up to people in Dudley.
@james2288 I'm around all the time. Let me know if there is every anything you want me to do or think I should know about.
. @WMPolice Why are you sending such ridiculous messages? I said PUBLIC & the PUBLIC won't be able to get in.
Local people want criminals brought to court. How can that be happening with 1 million fewer hearings than 2010? http://t.co/73Km8Ipu6L
@severnofnine @PoliceInspForum The figures show that 98 courts have closed completely since 2010
I've uncovered unbelieable figures showing magistrates' courts are dealing with 1 million fewer cases than in 2010 http://t.co/nxy7SKeK3m
We saved Dudley's court with help from local people, now need help to save our police station http://t.co/a701fXkiCq http://t.co/2kUC6R6LAr

@Lee_85_Wilson @davidpitt88 @sph18741972 I've definitely signed it. Should be updated overnight
Asked govt why criminals in the Black Country aren't going to court. Watch here at 15:19 http://t.co/iTvKKw4Sej http://t.co/i0Jhjf9ptL
Recognise this creep? @WMPolice & @DudleyPolice want to talk to him about burglary in Wollescote http://t.co/rN9pAHQh2f
Charming. Just been emailed a death threat by someone who thinks I shouldn't comment on Farage's views on NHS. Anonymous coward of course
So much for freedom of speech. Look at reaction if you dare to comment on Farage wanting insurance-based healthcare http://t.co/gDCNhL7vCC
@garyjohnlennon Thanks. Great man.
@adamnorman6 Sorry to hear that. I always answer. Email me at austini@parliament.uk
Amazing to think @AndySawfordMP elected 2 years ago tonight. A great candidate & a great MP. Doing brilliant work for Corby & East Northants
@AndySawfordMP @tobyperkinsmp Happy days. A great result for Labour
Good to see @andyburnhammp take on UKIP over privatising our NHS. Farage said UK should have "insurance-based system" http://t.co/d0v8X5hMPV
UKIP say they believe in the NHS but this shows what Farage really thinks: privatise it & bring in US-style insurance http://t.co/gDCNhL7vCC

@sph18741972 I am. I have written personally to the minister - more effective. They at least have to read the letter then read & sign reply

@Jonnt Have you seen my stuff on immigration? Fair ways of addressing people's concerns: http://t.co/mKA06DCVcv Tell me what you think
@cookie6229 To be honest, they don't get debated. They are a way of raising issues, but I write to ministers as they at least have to reply
Watch Farage say our NHS should be privatised. He actually says he's "being completely honest" about it! http://t.co/zc9q4NVSou(48 mins in)
@cookie6229 I don't sign EDMs but I have written to ministers urging them to do this. That way, we at least get an answer

@donaldwmacleod 97. Simple error. I know as I was there helping organise Labour campaign for devolution. Beginning to wish I'd not bothered
@ablabz @WingsScotland Can't recall anyone saying that when we were asked to come & help campaign with the SNP on devo referendum in 97
@LittleRedRhino Charming. You'd have thought that with the extra money spent on education in Scotland, you'd be a bit more articulate
@burdzeyeview yeah. Sorry. Quite enjoyed working on it
@ACodify yes.
I'd like to apologise to anyone in Scottish Labour for "interfering" in 98 referendum, 1999 & 2003 Holyrood elections & this yr's referendum

@Pheaseylabour About half & half I reckon, but I'm a Villa fan. Hilariously my opponent in 2010 (London accountant) said he followed both!
Great to see my mate @patmcfaddenmp has been promoted. Congratulations.

@Cllrkaddy Welcome. Thanks. Hope you're ok.
@DesignStoreUK No. It's a serious point. Was paid for with cash he says was wasted.
@CouncillorLes @David_Cameron @George_Osborne But no cash unfortunately
@DesignStoreUK what nonsense. Lazy nonsense. Course we're not the same. But it's easier to claim we are.
@CouncillorLes The ones that escaped cancellation when @David_Cameron @George_Osborne scrapped AWM & most of funding for Dudley?
Are apprentices @David_Cameron & @George_Osborne met at New Street related to those Labour govt guaranteed when we funded new station?
Great to see @David_Cameron & @George_Osborne visit new station at Bham New Street, a scheme organised & funded by last Labour government!
@malcpowers @granlyn @madeinthemids It is unique and it will be on display in the House of Commons!
@stevealbury @granlyn @madeinthemids It is amazing. It is actually magnetic!

Met some great Black Country businesses at brilliant @madeinthemids event @HiggsandSons today. Learnt lots about issues facing manufacturing
@alpha_beatt  1941. Europe overrun. America not in the war. One country fought on for freedom.
@janemerrick23 Who would bother blackmailing minister for charities? Oxfam? RSPCA? Was it the dangerous subversives at Women's Institute?
@alpha_beatt Yeah. Sorry. Hitler would have been beaten without us.
@alpha_beatt On the other hand, motivating & leading Britain to beat Hitler and secure the world's freedom was quite an achievement.
@WhiteDeeUK it's not true.
@WhiteDeeUK I hope not.
Oh no. It's the third time White Dee 's been on my telly tonight.
Did David Cameron really just compare himself to Churchill? The greatest Brit tht ever lived? Must say the similarity's not struck me before
Great to see @BCLivingMuseum on @itvnews tonight. A truly world class tourist attraction. @chrisshipitv tells me he loved his visit!
@Awaywithcancer Thanks. Very kind. House of Commons or email austini@parliament.uk
Can you imagine Dudley without Arcade Toy Shop? http://t.co/WYTKbcX647 Been going there since I was a kid. I'll pop in to see Alan this week
@PDurnall @ExpressandStar WWF figures! My parents bought me an action man and a Scalectrix car in there. I've bought stuff for my kids too.
Generations of Dudley families will be devastated to read @ExpressandStar. Arcade Toy Shop is best shop in the town http://t.co/nLc0HcRX0g
Terrible news in @ExpressandStar tonight. V upset to hear Arcade Toy Shop at risk. My Christmas presents bought there & still shop there now
Been followed by Ukip deputy leader @paulnuttallukip. Welcome. Perhaps he can explain his plans to privatise the NHS? http://t.co/KnBpEvfhTC
@neffsdad Where's that? email me details to austini@parliament.uk & I'll get on to the council.
.@Pure_Bob They do. It is a brilliant transformation. Spend lots of Sunday afternoons here
Priory Park packed: kids in play area, people playing football, tennis, basketball, cricket. Friends hve done great job improving facilities
@BHARTEK Wednesday?
@vanaboutoz I'm sure the families of their British victims feel it's nothing to do with us.
@MrDogHeart Can't have listened to many then. Was an awful rant wrh made up figures & nonsense about how the victims acquiesce in their fate
@vanaboutoz I think it will be a very long time before he's proved right about anything
@BoxClinicCork No, actually, it didn't and it's not.
@JOYOURPAPARAZZI oh dear. I'm so sorry.
I'm eating these for Macmillan. Lovely! Couldn't go to coffee morning so can I have them with glass of wine instead? http://t.co/BajhrnXpH2
Injured soldiers collecting at Wolverhampton this morning were getting much better response than veterans at Euston #BlackCountryGenerosity
@Cometh_Light That is true. Fortunately for me.
Listening to Khalid Mahmoud. He's completely right to brand the terrorists the UNislamic State.
@Rae_MS Thanks. Great woman. Andrew Pakes was singing your praises the other day
@DeathNote1962 Cheers.
And by contrast, George Galloway just made one of worst speeches I've heard. Claimed ISIL victims quiesced in their persecution. Disgrace.
.@patmcfaddenmp just made one of the best speeches I have ever listened to in the House of Commons. Set out a really thoughtful & clear case
@KevBlower Good to hear from you and hope all is well. I think the chap needs to calm down a bit!
@MySweetLandlord Dunno. Because Parliament is in recess perhaps?
@dinky1950sf We 're not cutting taxes for them - which the Tories have done & UKIP want to
Thinking about UKIP? Read this: they're more Tory than the Tories, wantto cut taxes for millionaires & privatise NHS http://t.co/JuFvp254El
It's well worth reading what @patmcfaddenmp has to say about Syria and Iraq http://t.co/ieguqf3Cdo

@ElmoWoodward Please tell me if there is anything I should be doing or should know about
@ElmoWoodward Sure, but to be fair, I'm usually talking about education, jobs & other local issues. Doing 8 meetings on immigration just now
@DemiLeighXD @satbsingh Very kind. I was v lucky
@DemiLeighXD Not what I meant. I eat in Dudley all the time. I meant he wasn't having his family lunch in Dudley because he doesnt live here
@satbsingh Thanks. A great woman. Sadly not so well now. Upsets me a lot is that she can no longer read the books & plays she loved so much
@satbsingh @Afzal4Dudley Doesn't bother me. Anyway, he'll be voting Labour next May
.@Afzal4Dudley @satbsingh Funded by a labour govt. Funds since cut when Tories abolished AWM
.@Afzal4Dudley but says YOUR "local" survey. Printed in Somerset, posted from London, replies to Leicester. Paid for by multi-millionaires
Come on @Afzal4Dudley. You raised our local credentials. Tell us where this family Sunday lunch was. I can tell you mine was here in Dudley.
@katiemillward I'll check. @dudleymbc have told me & @CllrDave4Gornal & @CllrStuTurner they're doing it
.@Afzal4Dudley @CllrDave4Gornal Where? Bet it's not in Dudley?
.@Afzal4Dudley @CllrDave4Gornal Really? Main home? You use local schools & NHS? How many nights you spend there? Where's yr family home?
.CllrDave4Gornal I am. Not sure about @Afzal4Dudley
Come on @Afzal4Dudley. I answered your question. You answer mine. Do you really claim your home is in Sedgley?
.@Afzal4Dudley Want competition on who's local? I really live in Dudley. Use local schools & Russell's Hall. Shop locally. Can you say same?
.@Afzal4Dudley What's more, our material written & produced in Dudley. Delivered by volunteers. Yours paid for millionaire Tories.
@Afzal4Dudley @CllrDave4Gornal Grew up in Dudley, live in the borough. My home! You really saying your home is in Dudley? Your real home?

@SteveKnight7 A genius. A really great man. Can you think of a premiership manager who'd march for redundant miners or canvass for Labour?
London has a mayor. Scotland & Wales have First Ministers. Why doesn't the West Midlands have a regional Minister? http://t.co/Hc5iAw5ka9
Boosting Black Country output to national average would add £8bn to economy. Status quo bad for Midlands and economy http://t.co/IE8nZ8vidB
Spending per head in West Mids is below the national average. We should get a fair share and a say on how it's spent. http://t.co/Hc5iAw5ka9
If devolution is right for Scotland, why can't 5 million people in the West Midlands have a say on public spending? http://t.co/IE8nZ8vidB
@PeterPannier @annesnelgrove and a very good thing too.
Gordon Brown: "Everyone's flag, everyone's country, everyone's culture, everyone's streets". Quote of the campaign
@stefancyclist I supose I shouldn't really be surprised!
How utterly ungracious of David Cameron not to mention Gordon Brown's game-changing intervention. Why can't he rise above it? Just once.
Thank Gord for that.
Having given Salmond question, timing & electorate he wanted, I can't wait to see ace negotiator Cameron take on Merkel before EU referendum
@MarkFoxNews @craigawoodhouse always did
@MarkFoxNews @craigawoodhouse Oh yeah. It was all planned.
@McPartlandJohn @fourasienne open it.
@m_flavell With style. He would have voted with style.
Let's be fair: David Cameron played a blinder. Gave Salmond question, timing, electorate he wanted. Brilliant. Our PM's a negotiating genius
@TarshaBarsha He's always great. It's the subject, not the man.
@HildaWheeler Oh yeah. Apologies.. I did. I'll swing by and have a look. Thanks
@HildaWheeler Where?
@TarshaBarsha Oh come on. Be fair. He's not a fashion designer. It was white. It had sleeves. Not sure any male I know could have added more
Excellent news. Just been followed by Welsh politics and comms expert Jackie Aplin. Follow her here: @Appyjack
Excellent: the BBC have put Primal Scream on. Paaarrrty!
Huw Edwards has so little to report he is now walking around the newsroom showing people looking at computers. Fascinating broadcasting
This period on election nights always makes me laugh - when the broadcasters are just killing time with no clue about what'd happening
@Phillip_D_Jones It's not OK. Course not. But it's much better than losing.
Huw Edwards just showed pics of BBC place n the Clyde. Looks different without a mob of crazed Nats outside screaming about @bbcnickrobinson
I reckon it will be OK. 55-45 or 54-46. Something like that, I reckon.

@the_itch1980 
+Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, Robin Cook, John Reid? No, none at all.
@danielblaney Yep. Very much
@the_itch1980 Great. Let's break up the most successful 300 year partnership because of a temporary Tory government. Brilliant idea.
@rubeusflint Great. Let's break up the most successful 300 year partnership because of a temporary Tory government. Brilliant idea.
@Jam3sPJ Great. Let's break up the most successful 300 year partnership because of a temporary Tory government. Brilliant idea.
@jtcawley01 Great. Let's break up the most successful 300 year partnership because of a temporary Tory government. Brilliant idea.
@GBDollop68 I wasn't.
I think it comes down to this: Britain, the greatest country in the world, ended slavery, defeated fascism & built the NHS. Why break it up?
@Gail_McDade @AndySawfordMP No way! We 'd never have won if that had come out!
Cool @AndySawfordMP down with the kids @Gail_McDade
@TalOfer Terrible joke. I've written plenty of awful jokes in my time but that's really terrible.
@OneManWallopem We'll see
@OneManWallopem Good luck with that. It'll all be forgotten on Friday I'm sure.
@DavidMills73 Block him. Now.
@TimMontgomerie Ha! It's the only thing he's remembered for!
Really helpful of the BBC to put Peter Bone & John Redwood  on the news. That'll help. Thanks for coming.
@iainmartin1 No way! How can they say that? Where are their crystal balls?
Here he is , the great Brian Taylor. A truly great man. Super smart
@chrisdeerin Yeah. Tragically.
@jameschappers @Survation But how many voters is the difference between 26% & 33%? Probably about ten out of maybe a thousand polled?
@chrisdeerin Doesn't 1999 with Donald Dewar seem a long time ago?
@ravensrod Fool. What a stupid thing to say. Just nonsense
@chrisdeerin Oh mate, you should definitely have done that: "There's been a murdah".
@ravensrod Proving my point
Does Salmond really think the poison & argument he's unleashed will be miraculously replaced on Friday with reasonable positive negotiation?
@MrHarryCole Oh come on. On this at least you can be serious. It's the future of our country for God's sake
@MrHarryCole Whose side are you on?
Yes mob disrupt Ed Miliband visit in Scotland. Is this what wld happen if you had nerve to disagree with Salmond in an independent Scotland?
What an utterly ludicrous report by Paul Mason on Channel Four News just now. He could at least try to contain his excitement.
@jbradley180 Really? Fantastic. I'll nip down tomorrow.
What a complete disgrace: the Co-op have stopped selling Marmite Rice-cakes! Can you believe it? Who else sells them in the Black Country?
@ninderjohal @ExpressandStar Thaks. I've been working hard on this and I know you have too. Well done.
Here's the @ExpressandStar story on the breakthrough in our campaign to get superfast broadband for the Black Country http://t.co/IXY9oQg7Uz
@Jonnt the Govt classes superfast as 24mbps or more. Exact speeds in Dudley will depend on BT's plans due to be released in next 6 months

@BillDudleyNorth @JamesJimCarver @sunpoliticsmids @JSeymourUKIP Facebook limited? You said "I will stand down". But you won't. Just happens.
@BillDudleyNorth @JamesJimCarver @sunpoliticsmids @JSeymourUKIP It's all nonsense. Rules v clear. Yr suggesting you'd choose to stand down
@BillDudleyNorth @JamesJimCarver @sunpoliticsmids @JSeymourUKIP But nowhere have any of you said it's a legal requirement.
@JamesJimCarver @BillDudleyNorth @sunpoliticsmids @JSeymourUKIP Er, yes. So what? Don't rules say can't be MEP & in national legislature?

Really looking forward to opening new facilities at Dormston School in Sedgley today & to congratulating them on improved results.
I thought I'd watch Cops and Robbers again. Big mistake. Just as annoyed. It's no better the second time.
Ordinary people in Dudley want criminals to take responsibility or put behind bars: http://t.co/wRhhbboPHA (starts about 2.07)

@Jonnt I've always been on the side of people who work hard, pay their way and obey the rules. I know whose side I am on.
Apparently Jason Stokes, thief on #copsandrobbers, spent 25% of life in prison. Not long enough: http://t.co/cQb3eebNWF (starts about 2.07)

@hebeindc When isn't it?
@Cliffyboy13 Dunno. Not sure 'd want any of them voting for me, though.
@wiltshireham No. Should be in the West Midlands.
@Cliffyboy13 Yes. But I was answering yr point about him being a constituent etc
@Cliffyboy13 Stokes wasn't. He lives in Pensnett. When he's not in prison. Which is where he should be
@Cliffyboy13 @didavies_star Sure. But you'll find them in every town. I'd gave preferred them not to focus on Dudley
. @JananGanesh or the 42% he got in Scotland. Compared to 16% the Tories managed. And more than twice what SNP got
@ratcliffe72 I 'm not and I do.
@JazVock Has problems like anywhere else. But the idea those people are typical of Dudley folk is garbage
Dudley's decent, law-abiding hard-working taxpayers (vast majority) will be delighted to see how their taxes spent on Cops & Robbers tonight
What a terrible  & unrepresentative impression of the town I'm proud to come from the dreadful programme Cops & Robbers presented tonight

@Afzal4Dudley Always worth checking facts. Unpopularity of government and how Scots protect themselves from it is be a huge factor
@Afzal4Dudley "Despise"? In 2010, led by Gordon Brown, Labour got 42% of all votes in Scotland. Your party got 16% and came 4th.
Live in Dudley? Can I help? I'm at Gornal Library at 9, Sedgley Library (10) Bramford School (11) & Sledmere Comm Centre (12) No appt needed
Great first step today, but let's scrap the Bedroom Tax immediately http://t.co/O8k9xJ514r
Live in Dudley? Can I help? Anything You want to tell me? I'll be at Dudley Library at 5.00 pm. No appointment needed - just come along.
Apologies again for changing appts in Dudley but was certainly worth going to London: We won all 3 votes! Looks like Bedroom Tax on way out!
On way back to London to vote against the bedroom tax. Had lots of people in Dudley contact me about the impact it's had on them
@GuidoFawkes @JohnRentoul @DAaronovitch Agent Hodges? He's not exactly working undercover, is he? @DPJHodges

@jamie_angus It talks about how we protect workers, prevent abuse of minimum wage & agency staff, and stop migrant workers being exploited
@iggy1914 @Glinner @StuartClarkeUK @loveandgarbage ridiculous nonsense.
@iggy1914 @Glinner @StuartClarkeUK @loveandgarbage Have you actually watched any of the committee or heard any of the questions?
@iggy1914 @Glinner @StuartClarkeUK @loveandgarbage what a stupid & idiotic comment. An unbelievably ridiculous thing to say.
@loveandgarbage What looks odd? We asked lots of questions about Rotherham.
@StuartClarkeUK @loveandgarbage @Glinner Asked lots of questions on Rotherham & have another session next week with police, PCC, council etc
@StuartClarkeUK @loveandgarbage @Glinner Session scheduled on coverage of Cliff Richard before Rotherham report published, so did that first
Asked chief constable why 11 year-old being abused was arrested instead of abusers & why fathers trying to rescue daughters were arrested
Asked Sth Yorks chf constable what action taken after police said 12 yr-old girl having sex with 5 males "was 100% consensual in every case"
Just finishing up on questions about Cliff Richard investigation at @CommonsHomeAffs. About to move onto disgraceful events in Rotherham

@SamG_Design lower bills? Greater efficiency? Maybe you think govts should dictate what clothes or shoes you can wear too?
@nuttyxander No. I think that if we have to make cuts we could start with people dreaming up this nonsense, not librarians
@SamG_Design then let the consumer decide! People will buy better, energy efficient products with lower bills
@nuttyxander Sure. But let consumers and the market decide. People will by better, energy efficient products with lower bills
@nuttyxander It's still nonsense. Why do bureaucrats working on this garbage nvr get cut instead of things like libraries?
@AndyCavster I said nat govts. It's still nonsense. Why do bureaucrats working on this garbage nvr get cut instead of things like libraries?
How on earth can EU or even nat govts decide how powerful a hoover you can buy? Ludicrous nonsense. What next? Kettles? Toaster? Food mixer?
@JacobTipper @ChrisElaa I bet he did. But what I was trying to say is that unlike me, you both have the ability to capitalise on it.

Backing local campaigners all the way to save Seven Stars. Have asked Marstons and Dudley Council to protect the pub.
http://t.co/qWD62naXS3
@oflynnmep And that's why you're backing the Tories? Unbelievable!
@oflynnmep So you'd back the Tories. There we have it: vote Farage, get Cameron. But with bigger NHS cuts, more tax cuts for wealthiest etc
@oflynnmep If you balance of power, isn't it inconceivable that you'd back anyone but the Tories? What policies wld you demand?
Farage says he wants UKIP to have the balance of power. Would just mean another five years of the Tories - but with more extreme policies
@BCHBoss The heating's been on. In August! Is this a record?
Farage said again today that he wants to hold balance of power. Who would he put in No 10? Vote UKIP, get the Tories http://t.co/AVihBuEhD7

@wayneofwolves @Geezajay2013 I agree. And I think going abroad to join terrorist organisations is treacherous & unforgivable too.
@afneil Not sure. But I think the "moderator" lost. They should have got you to do it
@MrHarryCole Dunno about that. I thought it was a bit of a shouty shambles to be honest.
@RicHolden @CCHQPress You're not helping.
The moderator 's come back.
Not sure who's won. But the "moderator" has definitely lost. Beyond useless. And whoever picked the cheerleading audience should be sacked
@Sue_Woodward fascinating. But terrible
Alex Salmond can get his own supporters to cheer by claiming Alastair is backing the Tories but he won't persuade anyone else. Just not true
What a terrible debate. Just shouting. Salmond an odd combination of smug & shouty. The "moderator" is useless
@FansofWhiteDee About time then. Last one was in 2007
@xDaniielle @BranRAF Get them together & we'll meet? Even if they don't vote 4 me, they shld vote. Otherwise they'll just keep ignoring them
@xDaniielle @BranRAF Force them to listen. Important thing is to vote. Less than 1/3 yng people vote. That's why they hit young pple hardest
@xDaniielle @BranRAF Not by them. You do by me.
@gavinmiller80 It is a huge insult to all the people who get up every morning and go out to work. She's not worked since 2007!
@xDaniielle Exactly right. They should listen to people like you and @BranRAF working hard to get on in life.
Why hve Tories got White Dee at conference? Disgrace. If she can get to city centre 4 that, she can get there to work. Get her a job instead
V sorry Lord Attenborough has died. Lovely man. I well remember him campaigning in Brierley Hill & excitement he caused in 1994 by-election
Look what I spotted outside @procyclehire. A bamboo bike with carbon lugs & internal cables! Was incredibly light http://t.co/3TxmPYk1dp
@Dwarfio Hope it all goes well. Best wishes to the family. Lovely spot Albrighton. Rode through there this morning
@Dwarfio Have you moved? No longer in the Black Country?
Did you see how much he won by? New British record. What a great man Mo Farah is!
Watching Mo Farah. Remember what he said at Olympics? "This is my country & when I put on my Great Britain vest I'm proud. I'm very proud"
Read @patmcfaddenmp explain why people who say extremism in Middle East is nothing to do with us are completely wrong http://t.co/mNB8lecArZ
@bonitobunny it's outrageous. I've got the council involved and am onto the police & landlord. Trying to get a meeting next week
@PeazM @cllr_aston @WestMidsPCC @D_C_Jamieson But as there was an election, I'm delighted Labour won so convincingly. Especially in Dudley
@PeazM @cllr_aston @WestMidsPCC @D_C_Jamieson Agree. Voted against PCCs but govt legislation said had to be byelection in August. Ludicrous
Thanks to all in Dudley Nth who voted Labour y'day. No complacency, but v encouraging: won overall & won all wards but one. Our work goes on
@CllrDave4Gornal @Afzal4Dudley Not wishing to be pedantic but for a male it should also be "mon ami". Took French A' level at Dudley School
Worse, the Tories' recorded message described their candidate as the Police & Crime Commisioner. Clearly untrue. That allowed? Vote Labour!
Just had one of those nuisance recorded messages asking me to vote Tory today! As you can imagine I'm backing @D_C_Jamieson. Vote Labour!
@ericjoyce Read the article
The thing about Sam Galbraith was this: having cheated death, he treated his life as a bonus. He took his causes seriously, but not himself.
@MnWthtQualities Oh come on. I promise you, govt is not to be feared. It's usually too incompetent to mount a conspiracy.
The crazy Assange conspiracy theorists and his ludicrous defenders might like to read this: http://t.co/9tRhRBfzUW
@ericjoyce But they don't wang to question him. They want to arrest him. See point four here: http://t.co/9tRhRBfzUW
@MnWthtQualities Please stop feeling sorry for yourself. It wasn't meant to be contemptuous but I can't handle this self-reverential garbage
@MnWthtQualities I meant a this garbGe about surveillance. I promise you that "they" are not checking your your texts. It's just nonsense
Sam Galbraith passed away. A great man. A lifetime serving others. One of nicest politicians when I workd in Scotland http://t.co/qTtqOVrXpS
@MnWthtQualities For god 's sake, get over yourself: they're not monitoring your texts. ' emails. It's just fanciful self-obsessed garbage
@e_p_smythe I can think of a few more differences than that!
@MnWthtQualities No. Seriously: what do you call a spy who flees to Russia with secrets? In the old days, he'd have been called a traitor.
@geoffjellis Interestong. Email me details? Austini@parliament.uk
@ThomasEvansUKIP What?
What's the difference between Snowden & Kim Philby: one leaks secrets & flees to Russia. The other leaks secrets & flees to Russia. #traitor
@DavidMills73 I've never understood this "become more right wing as you get older" thing. I don't think my views have changed that much.
@GrahamJones_MP but why are you still wearing a suit? And a tie? In August?
Just finished Spy Among Friends by @BenMacintyre1. Brilliant. Philby fled to Russia with Western secrets. But how is Snowden any different?
Lovely: UKIP MEP Janice Atkinson calls Thai constituent a "ting tong from somewhere". Was she vetted before election? http://t.co/MoDHrbpah0
Stunned to see on @BBCNews that the cost of Assange's ludicrous Ecuadorian embassy stunt is £7.5 million. Should go to Sweden & face justice
@1967rjs Sure. I think we're fixing something up with the committee.
@GylesB1 @Dannythefink I think I might ask for the one they took down as a memento.
@1967rjs Good. Well done. As I've said, let me know what more I can do to help
@GylesB1 @Dannythefink A week after opening one with my name, I tried to show off to my kids & it had been replaced by one with a cllr on it
@GylesB1 @Dannythefink I once unveiled a plaque to see it said: "this plaque was unveiled by Tom Watson MP"!
@ajcdeane He wrote it. Idea he won't get picked is even more hysterical. He must think people are fools if he expects them to believe that
Read last bit: Farage pretends he's not certain to be selected in Thanet. Wht garbage! Anyone want to bet against it? http://t.co/vtjpi0eMDU
@GraGraSsh @CllrDave4Gornal but things usually aren't usually simple yes/no answers are they? I was pretty clear, but tried to explain why
@GraGraSsh @CllrDave4Gornal Well what does flying Union Jack all year round mean? Pretty clear I think. Also said happy to meet & discuss
@GraGraSsh @CllrDave4Gornal Bit unfair. I gave v clear answer: said should fly Union Jack every day. I campaigned for that & Labour did it
@KarlTurnerMP How old was he when Cuba last had a free and fair election?
Situation at Coventry City is ludicrous. Imagine what it's like for Sky Blues fans trundling all way to Northampton. Not even in West Mids!
Great to see Jerry Blackett from @BrumChamber on @bbcmtd. A great man who makes huge contribution to economy & jobs in the region
@1967rjs I have written to the planning authority which is the body that can impose them.
@GraGraSsh But I'm not. In any case, I campaigned & eventually persuaded them to fly Union Jack every day. That's what I think they shld fly
@GraGraSsh it is hypothetical, as you said. But I think we should fly Union Jack all year round.
@ColeInfo Cheers. Very sorry I can't be there.
@GraGraSsh ... equality, freedom, fairness & tolerance. Previous council refused. Labour agreed when we took control.
@GraGraSsh Lets meet to discuss? I campaigned to fly Union Jack all year round as symbol of great British values: democracy, equality cont'd
@ColeInfo @1967rjs Sent message & apologies to meeting & explained why can't attend. Can meet whn get back? Email me @ austini@parliament.uk
@ColeInfo @1967rjs Am v concerned & have written to council on behalf of residents. Afraid I can't attend as abroad with family. Cont'd ...
@1967rjs For some reason I've only just seen this but I wrote to council & owners over a week ago on behalf of residents who contacted me
@bonitobunny terrible. It's outrageous: email me details and I'll try to help.
@wainwright_star Ha! But the 3rd Miliband brother is actually Steve. He's a famous musician. Had a hit in the 80s with Abracadabra
@gornalgooner @Dwarfio That's true. It's there. But how did they carry the plaque up? It's enormous. Must have weighed a ton!
@Dwarfio Same here. But what an experience!
@Dwarfio Under-age drinking? Surely not! Bizarrely re child, a parent at summit asked us if we'd seen his sons. How do you lose them there?
@Dwarfio Apparently he climbed it 107 times. Last time at 91. Imagine that! The memorial is brilliant. Did he say how they got plaque up?
Guess what @cllr_aston @midgebite & I are having for tea? Haggis, neeps & tatties! Beautiful food. http://t.co/HXLc1Lc9Kh
@Dwarfio Well done. Excellent. He is a legend. Saw the great man's grave and memorial last night
With @midgebite (Cllr Tom McLennan) leader of Lochaber Council. Discussing rekindling Dudley-Fort William twinning pioneered by Bert Bissell

@stevepcarr @steveatwordsley Not here to defend council - far from it. But trust me: big problem. Affects many areas. Not simple to solve
@MsGemGems I want to see peace, negotiations and a two--state solution.
@stevepcarr @steveatwordsley ideas for the town. Difficult in 140 characters. Email me at austini@parliament.uk & I'll reply in detail
@stevepcarr @steveatwordsley We can all do more. But problems much bigger than that. Traditonal town centres decline across UK. Need new ...
@Fastaid_BC Cheers. Not sure about having a great time though! It's easy for @cllr_aston. He's done it before. I barely walk to the fridge
@stevepcarr @steveatwordsley Agree on college. Brilliant. But more complex than blaming council. Merry Hill, losing uni campus internet etc
@MsGemGems Terrible situation. Very concerned but difficult in just 140 characters. Email me at austini@parliament.uk & I'll reply in detail
@BCHBoss I mean it. You know what I think of you and your work.
Great to see @BCHBoss on @bbcmtd. A great woman from Dudley, doing brilliant work for the region's children
@steveatwordsley First job ws in the High St. I know it better than most. Course I want things improved. But I love Dudley & I'm proud of it
@cllr_aston That only goes up to Tuesday! I am sure Wednesday will be beautiful!
@soxer99 @ExpressandStar @dudleyzoo It's working again. Try it now! It's like when you go back to your old school: doesn't look as big!
.@steveatwordsley Grew up here & live here. Love Dudley & proud of it. Being elected to stand up for Dudley is best job anyone could have.
Doesn't refurbished entrance @dudleyzoo look good? Great job. Well done. Been through those turnstiles few times ... http://t.co/ZFmJ6mL3Mm

@TheAnglingRev Thanks. Terrible situation. Very concerned about what is happening. Can write/email or meet to discuss in more detail? But ..
@dudleycil thanks. Can you send the link or more detail please?
@EdHart6 It's not perfect but I think alternatives would be less accountable and less democratic
@EdHart6 I disagree. PR means horse-trading to form coalitions and the pledges people vote being dumped. Makes polticians less accountable
Great question by @patmcfaddenmp at PMQs. Countries get big job on commission if they send big hitter or build alliances. UK's doing neither
@stourglassboy @wainwright_star @Stourbhour Thanks. More detail about my idea here: http://t.co/hu2h4eDV8F Let's hope the Commission agrees

@capitalcashfund it's ridiculous whatever it is.
Pony tails on men are always terrible. Always. But that Argentinian sub's really is the most ridiculous I have ever seen.
@KatsDekker Love the British-built Sturmey Archer gears. My first bikes had those.
@sigreg Yeah. But the free kick was incredible.
@KatsDekker How cool is that?
Weren't all those seven goals just stunning?
Clearly offside. Great call.
@LaMinx541 I don't understand. Too early? It's well past 11.00am. Are you abroad, in a different time zone? Is that it?
I think this is probably the first time in my life that I've supported Germany.
@krislorentzen But incident prompting petition clearly caused by lorry driver who admitted careless driving. Obviously not cylist's fault
@krislorentzen Why? Driver that killed cyclist that led to petition admitted careless driving. Had 1200m visibility. Ban him, not cyclists
Is this incident in petition to ban time trials? http://t.co/15Oz8fdNei He admitted careless driving. 1200m visability. Not cyclist's fault
MP claims cyclists "bring it on themselves" if they time trial on dual carriageway | road.cc http://t.co/f3B8QCo6av HT@nethertonboy1

@colinwforster @adamboultonSKY Yes, but the places were provided & funded by last Labour govt. I accept coalition didn't scrap their courses
Did David Cameron really just claim credit for employing more GPs? They take 7 years to train & were recruited & trained by Labour!
@Hanargh I know. Always made me laugh too.
@John_Wheatley Why?
@JayneInnes thanks. Can you email details: austini@parliament.uk
@TimMontgomerie Terrifying. I'd say I'm not very well and can't come.
@AlexandrCox certainly did. Won the adoption lottery
@BillyBlackbourn yeah, I was waiting for that
@nashienet I think adopting 4 would be very difficult today? Plus their age at the time, one was heavy smoker, other had heart condition etc
My mum and dad adopted four of us. One was a diplomat, one's a teacher & the other a snr midwife but I bet they couldn't adopt us all today!
What more can be done to speed up adoption so that other children can have the start in life I was so lucky to have?
I'm on a committee today looking at plans to speed up adoption. Great idea. Being adopted by my parents was best thing that happened to me
@tomwilson23 Yes. I thought that too.
Watching the news? George Osborne didn't look very natural traveling on the tube. Was he looking for first class?
@Andybettridge1 Nearly finished but I reckon I'm the only MP still in the place

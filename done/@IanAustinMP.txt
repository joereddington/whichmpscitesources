@mike_tavender It's "you're" not "your" in that context. Here's an example: you're boring and you're blocked. Cheers. Wed Feb 25 22:06:40 GMT 2015
@mike_tavender Don't be so po-faced Wed Feb 25 21:56:53 GMT 2015

Here we are in Wolverhampton: Back in the Black Country! Wed Feb 25 21:38:55 GMT 2015
@monkeyboyallt Why? We're the centre of the universe. They should be catching a direct train to us. Wed Feb 25 21:32:08 GMT 2015
I think we've just been through Tipton or Coseley. Just been past the new LIDL! Wed Feb 25 21:30:58 GMT 2015
@FownesBrewing Don't worry. Made arrangements. Wed Feb 25 21:27:27 GMT 2015
Sandwell & Dudley is famous for being place where train hammered through instead of stopping for official opening! Driver forgot to stop! Wed Feb 25 21:25:42 GMT 2015
Now this IS interesting. Outrageously we're not stopping at Sandwell & Dudley (or Oldbury as we locals remember it) Next stop Wolverhampton Wed Feb 25 21:24:11 GMT 2015
@hebeindc forget the glamour of DC. The WM is the greatest place in the world Wed Feb 25 21:20:17 GMT 2015
@hebeindc Hebe should be in WM. Wed Feb 25 21:17:13 GMT 2015
On these journeys home I always remember as a kid how my dad once had to go to London for a meeting, fell asleep on train & woke up in Crewe Wed Feb 25 21:15:55 GMT 2015
I'm at New Street. I can see the Rotunda! #nearlyhome Wed Feb 25 21:13:04 GMT 2015
Now pulling into Brum. A great place. But let's never forget that Dudley lit the industrial revolution's spark & changed whole of the world. Wed Feb 25 21:08:08 GMT 2015
@bonitobunny You are a great woman. Thanks so much. Wed Feb 25 21:05:18 GMT 2015

@bonitobunny Sorry - I have to go to Parliament. Big part of job. Wed Feb 25 20:51:04 GMT 2015
At Coventry. YES! Always feel I'm nearly home when train stops here. Is it cos I I worked here in 90s or because it's 1st stop in West Mids? Wed Feb 25 20:48:10 GMT 2015
@bonitobunny How did it go? Let me know if there are issues you want me to raise. Sorry not there but had to be at work in parliament today Wed Feb 25 20:45:19 GMT 2015
@bonitobunny Sorry wasn't there. But meeting was it? Been at work in Parliament. We had a vote at 7.00pm. I'm on train back to Dudley now Wed Feb 25 20:40:35 GMT 2015

Has @DebraClaridge seen conference on pay & conditions for care workers organised by @resfoundation? You shld speak http://t.co/zY9aBI2wwj Wed Feb 25 10:47:05 GMT 2015
@DeanPerks Nonsense. Didn't lie at all. Farage wnts insurance system. Nuttall praised privatisation. I quoted them exactly. Complain to them Tue Feb 24 22:45:47 GMT 2015
@DeanPerks Fair enough. You know better than Chief Exec. All I did is quote your leader & deputy leader. Don't like it? Take it up with them Tue Feb 24 18:53:38 GMT 2015
@DeanPerks Anyway, don't take it from me. Read Paula Clark letter. It clearly says it's efficiciency savings. Doesn't mention contract costs Tue Feb 24 18:32:36 GMT 2015
@DeanPerks But if the govt borrowed £300 million to build the hospital, it wld have to pay interest on the debt as well as maintenance etc Tue Feb 24 18:31:25 GMT 2015
@DeanPerks No, it's not. Didn't happen under last govt with same contract. Is because this govt requires £12m "efficiency savings" every yr Tue Feb 24 18:03:45 GMT 2015
What's extraordinary is that Russells Hall is £8 million in deficit, 400 staff losing their jobs & minister says everything is ok. Useless Tue Feb 24 12:18:02 GMT 2015
Just asked health minister about Russells Hall losing 1 in 10 staff. Chief exec says "care at risk".  Minister completely failed to answer Tue Feb 24 12:12:49 GMT 2015
@SadlerLeanne Shocking. Poor animal. Email me details and we''ll get on to the council: austini@parliament.uk? Mon Feb 23 12:54:34 GMT 2015
@Sathnam Great man. Work experience and access to professions & their schemes is a huge barrier for bright kids from the Black Country. Sun Feb 22 13:40:26 GMT 2015
Cracking piece on nepotism by @Sathnam. Shld definitely arrange place @thetimes for his mate's daughter. No question. http://t.co/IVSeKuRjgg Sun Feb 22 13:29:44 GMT 2015
Great to be in Sedgley wth @DudleyMayor to congratulate Clunis Chesworth & team on achieving @FairTradeUK town status http://t.co/QryWy7zE6o Sat Feb 21 15:24:27 GMT 2015
@normanthetroll I'm obviously worried about that. Let's met and discuss? Can you email me your details to austini@parliament.uk? Fri Feb 20 15:51:58 GMT 2015
Just met @socialbreak to hear how they're getting young people engaged & listened to in election. Wht a great project http://t.co/CSvLCPNSng Fri Feb 20 15:40:15 GMT 2015
@lowendbehold I agree on the economy. Education & skills the number 1 priority to bring new investment, industries. & jobs to areas like our Fri Feb 20 15:37:08 GMT 2015
@Rolo_Tamasi But there are other ways of paying - like graduate tax, for example. And  fee increase hasn't worked - the system is in deficit Fri Feb 20 10:20:00 GMT 2015
@satbsingh  I'd love to. There are also plenty of students @wlv_uni who will be vositn. Perhaps @BBCr4today shld've spoken to some of them? Fri Feb 20 08:53:25 GMT 2015
@lowendbehold Wages up just 1.6% in West Mids over last 5 years compared with 10% in South East. Need action to tackle cost of living crisis Fri Feb 20 08:51:40 GMT 2015
@lowendbehold Of course. But point I'm making is that rents & bills are going up but wages stay same for so many in the Black Country ... Fri Feb 20 08:50:34 GMT 2015
Brilliant: @BritishCycling men's pursuit team get silver weeks after @StevenBurke88 broke collarbone! http://t.co/c71pdlOWfK On track 4 Rio! Fri Feb 20 08:44:28 GMT 2015

Students @WLV_UNI on @BBCr4today say they won't vote after tuition fees hike. But it's because students don't vote that they do these things Fri Feb 20 08:22:41 GMT 2015
@mike_tavender Oh well done. Very witty. Thu Feb 19 21:28:13 GMT 2015
@davebytheway it's massive for us over next few games. Relegation would be a real tragedy. I'd love to have a beer mate. Let's fix it up Thu Feb 19 21:26:45 GMT 2015
@davebytheway Working mate I'm afraid. Loads on on Saturday! Fingers crossed though Thu Feb 19 21:22:08 GMT 2015
Poor lads. Last two laps. What a shame. Fair play to the Kiwis. But I reckon we're on track for Rio Thu Feb 19 21:16:06 GMT 2015
German pursuit team just fell apart. Where's your Vorsprung durch Technik now, then? Thu Feb 19 21:11:27 GMT 2015
Cyclists: press the BBC red button and watch the team pursuit. Britain up next for the gold Thu Feb 19 21:06:59 GMT 2015
@StuartClarkeUK terrible joke! Thu Feb 19 20:28:40 GMT 2015
@SmithTonyD No. I'm sorry. It's horrendous nonsense. The Clash and the Jam came along to blow that nonsense away Thu Feb 19 20:12:50 GMT 2015
@unojen_wood I'm sorry, but they really are terrible. I like to believe I'm a nice, reasonable, tolerant bloke but they are really dreadful Thu Feb 19 20:06:06 GMT 2015
@TheStevenThomas @TwoToneCentral I haven't. Didn't know about it. But I will now. Thu Feb 19 20:03:38 GMT 2015
@williamstafford I know. It really is. About time we had a drink? Thu Feb 19 19:58:54 GMT 2015
From the ridiculous to the sublime on #TOTP2. From the ridiculous ACDC to the brilliant Specials. What a fantastic song.I loved the Specials Thu Feb 19 19:56:23 GMT 2015
Oh no. ACDC. Ridiculous people in their silly outfits, with their meaningless lyrics & their ludicrous hair-dos. Tasteless. Beyond dreadful. Thu Feb 19 19:55:05 GMT 2015
@williamstafford Can you believe? Seems like yesterday that we walked nervously into Priory Rd building in blazers that were too big for us Thu Feb 19 19:53:37 GMT 2015
Here we are on #TOTP2: @paulineblack & the Selector. All the way from Coventry. Fantastic. Thu Feb 19 19:50:16 GMT 2015
I love watching #TOTP2 but it does make me feel a bit nostalgic and old. I'd completeky forgotten about the Regents as well. Thu Feb 19 19:48:03 GMT 2015
I'd forgotten all about the Chords. What happened to them? More to the point, what happened to me? I'm 50 this year. 50! Where'd it all go? Thu Feb 19 19:43:51 GMT 2015
Quick: Turn on BBC4 NOW! It's #TOTP2. Annie Lennox with the Tourists. Still sounds brilliant. Her & Dave Stewart's class shines through Thu Feb 19 19:33:39 GMT 2015
Fascinating to go round @nuttall_ltd's huge site today. Dudley's largest manufacturer & largest private sector business. Brilliant business Thu Feb 19 19:20:56 GMT 2015

Oh dear. Sam Gyimah @SkyNews interview a complete car crash. Interviewer clearly knew much more than him. Said his answer was downright lie Thu Feb 19 09:29:31 GMT 2015
Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah MP on @SkyNews. Totally fails to explain why childcare costs in West Mids up by 51% - biggest rise in UK Thu Feb 19 09:27:38 GMT 2015

@hapspop Thanks. Sun Feb 15 20:59:05 GMT 2015
@hapspop D'you live in Dudley? Just email me: austini@parliament.uk. I meet constituents all time at surgeries, office or place to suit them Sun Feb 15 20:57:45 GMT 2015

@SarahNormanCX Assume was @crepestation? Their crepes are phenomenal. And the people who run it work so hard. A great Dudley business Sun Feb 15 19:57:05 GMT 2015
@RaviSubbie A great ambition. I'll definitely support that. Good luck Sun Feb 15 18:58:34 GMT 2015

@MissSNP73 @JonAshworth Well done. @natashamillward is a brilliant candidate and will be a superb MP. Got to get her in. Sat Feb 14 17:37:35 GMT 2015
Strong support for Labour on Kates Hill. Even got told off by one lady for wearing sort of pinky/purple jumper. Told me should've been red! Sat Feb 14 17:34:42 GMT 2015
Thanks so much to @JonAshworth & all the Labour supporters for their help today. Cracking turnout. Great afternoon's campaiging. So grateful Sat Feb 14 17:32:28 GMT 2015
@SikhFedUK Best wishes for successful event. Unfortunately I hve commitments in Dudley, so plse convey my apologies. Cld we meet to discuss? Sat Feb 14 11:20:38 GMT 2015

Hands up if you saw the Specials live #TOTP1980 Thu Feb 12 19:57:45 GMT 2015
I had the most fantastic afternoon at Priory School today with brilliant head Jill Bennett  - with whom I was at school. Great school. Thu Feb 12 19:56:48 GMT 2015
@ERA_Legal Bathams. Or Holdens. Obviously. Thu Feb 12 19:54:29 GMT 2015
@euanmccolm Jumpers for goalposts. Yes. I know. We can watch TOTP2, but we are too young for the illness that is nostalgia. Onward, onward. Thu Feb 12 19:53:48 GMT 2015
Jon and Vangelis. How ridiculous. How could an era that brought us the Jam and the Clash produce this? Thu Feb 12 19:52:19 GMT 2015
I love the way the orchestra are playing so seriously Thu Feb 12 19:50:59 GMT 2015
The Ramones!!! Now you're talking! #TOTP1980 Turn on BBC4 quick Thu Feb 12 19:48:35 GMT 2015
I have - I must confess - never had a Pina Colada #TOTP1980 Thu Feb 12 19:47:00 GMT 2015

@g_lodge In terms of games won and lost, @JohnGregory77 has best recent record Wed Feb 11 21:56:30 GMT 2015
Who should take charge at #AVFC? What about my mate @JohnGregory77? Best record of any recent manager & he's done a great job at Crawley Wed Feb 11 21:34:32 GMT 2015
@MiZWiZDesign Horrendous. Tell me where and I will speak to the council. Wed Feb 11 12:41:31 GMT 2015
From bad to worse for #AVFC. Two-nil at Hull. In bottom 3 & fighting for survival. Terrible. D'you think we'll go down? What should be done? Wed Feb 11 10:04:03 GMT 2015
@More_Able  cheers. Wasn't last week great ? Dunno about tonight's show - . Didn't see. What was happening? Tue Feb 10 23:04:46 GMT 2015
@findlater225 Don't be so po-faced. Anyway, I can assure I'm not poking fun. There is nothing funny about this meeting at all. Tue Feb 10 15:41:26 GMT 2015
@findlater225 I do. That is why it is so frustrating. Tue Feb 10 15:38:44 GMT 2015
We're going to be interrupted by a vote. Hurrah! Tue Feb 10 15:21:54 GMT 2015
I might ask the chair why we have James Brokenshire come at all. Surely it would be easier if they just sent the briefing he just reads out? Tue Feb 10 15:19:53 GMT 2015
All James Brokenshire seems to do is read out his brief in the most dull, & inaccessible language. I think he must be Minister for Mogadon. Tue Feb 10 15:16:44 GMT 2015
I'm in the @CommonsHomeAffs meeting. Listening to minister James Brokenshire. I really am losing the will to live. Tue Feb 10 15:13:28 GMT 2015

@wayneofwolves I know. Better than at Arsenal last week. Sat Feb 07 18:46:44 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves Email me and I'll tell you ;-) Sat Feb 07 18:39:46 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves I know planning was refused but I'm not on planning committee. Again: email me if you want the facts. Let's leave it there. Sat Feb 07 18:35:01 GMT 2015
@CraiggJ Ok. Cheers Sat Feb 07 18:30:55 GMT 2015
@CraiggJ I know. I was commenting on you saying you never thought you'd get a straight answer from a politician. Sat Feb 07 18:28:28 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves I'm perfectly calm. What beating? How does this work? You say what you like & I can't reply? If you want the facts, email me. Sat Feb 07 18:27:22 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves As I said, if you actually want to find out facts about my wrk, email me. In my experience, you've made up yr mind beforehand Sat Feb 07 18:26:10 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves I'll communicate as I want to. Don't know anythng about yr fetish club. I'm not on planning committee. I'm the MP. Not a cllr Sat Feb 07 18:24:12 GMT 2015
@CraiggJ Why? You can't have asked many! This blanket criticism of politicians is a bit ridiculous to be honest Sat Feb 07 18:22:59 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves For God's sake. I've emailed anyone who asked. You can do same. If - of course - you are actually interested in finding out Sat Feb 07 18:20:38 GMT 2015
@CraiggJ Of course. I'd be totally against town being closed down. No question. People can protest but others must be able to go to work etc Sat Feb 07 18:19:38 GMT 2015
@CraiggJ Yes. Of course. to demonstrate & protest. But not to insist on a march through the town, shutting all the shops & closing the roads Sat Feb 07 18:15:20 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves Email me if you are actually interested in hearing what I have done. Or you could just stick to believing whatever you want Sat Feb 07 18:14:11 GMT 2015
@wayneofwolves @coseley_lad Local people have to resolve it. But we don't need EDL coming to Dudley, closing the roads & shutting the shops Sat Feb 07 18:07:40 GMT 2015
@paddy67a Where have I condoned that? I'm talking about what happened here in Dudley today. If that's all right with you? Sat Feb 07 17:43:01 GMT 2015
@TELLitphoto Cheers. Just nipped in to get flowers for a constituent celebrating her hundredth birthday today! Sat Feb 07 17:39:35 GMT 2015
@paddy67a Who else marched through Dudley closing roads, shitting shops &  -  as happened last time - attacking residents & temples? Sat Feb 07 17:37:06 GMT 2015
@_BegsAli @ThatBloodyDuck @Ladyofhadess @ThatChikky Can you carry this on without me please? I have no idea what you're on about Sat Feb 07 17:34:03 GMT 2015
@TELLitphoto Cheers. Didn't see you? You should have said hello Sat Feb 07 16:39:10 GMT 2015
@paddy67a Actually, legally, they don't. They have the right to a static protest. Sat Feb 07 16:38:34 GMT 2015
@matt_neech That's not acceptable. But I just don't think the town should have been closed off & shops shut because of fears of violence Sat Feb 07 16:30:22 GMT 2015
@paddy67a No. That's wrong. I'm objecting to march thru town & threat of violence which meant traders had to close their shops. Sat Feb 07 16:28:03 GMT 2015
@Pure_Bob Of course. But shops weren't shut by protest at council house. They shut cos EDL insisted on march thru town & threat of violence Sat Feb 07 16:26:45 GMT 2015
Oh great! No one asked traders to close says @kevin_docherty. They closed cos they didn't want them & their premises attacked like last time Sat Feb 07 15:18:22 GMT 2015
@mark_goodhand All right mate. Hope you're ok. You're well preserved! Sat Feb 07 15:13:01 GMT 2015
Welcome to twitter my old schoolmate @mark_goodhand. Judging by his photo, he hasn't changed a bit Sat Feb 07 15:10:25 GMT 2015
@shewolf1877 @slideaway2002 The shops are shut and roads are closed because the EDL decided to come here Sat Feb 07 15:05:26 GMT 2015
@shewolf1877 I don't want to see any violence but previous times EDL thugs attacked local residents, traders, Sikh & Hindu temples & police Sat Feb 07 15:04:46 GMT 2015
@slideaway2002 You don't know wht you're talking about. Go & learn the facts. Taxpayers money pays for police stations not places of worship Sat Feb 07 15:02:33 GMT 2015
@DVDA1980 Yep - policing operation will cost hundreds of thousands at a time when cuts are forcing closure of our station. Just wonderful Sat Feb 07 14:53:49 GMT 2015
@slideaway2002 Of course people have freedom of speech but it's tragic they bring Dudley to standstill because they often cause violence too Sat Feb 07 14:48:30 GMT 2015
@Neiley83 outrageous their arrogance makes them think they have the right to Sat Feb 07 14:41:15 GMT 2015
@slideaway2002 I'm also very impressed by your anonymous bravery hiding behind some meaningless title. Sat Feb 07 14:40:11 GMT 2015
@slideaway2002 You idiot. You haven't got first clue about how our democracy works. & you lecture everyone else & bring town to standstill Sat Feb 07 14:38:34 GMT 2015
Appalling: EDL come from all over country & Dudley has to close roads & shut up shop. Just hope they don't cause violence like last time Sat Feb 07 14:37:07 GMT 2015
Can someone from the EDL let us have an address Dudley's traders can send an invoice to be reimbursed for the loss of trade today please? Sat Feb 07 14:32:48 GMT 2015
@slideaway2002 Nonsense. Police attacked EDL thugs who also beat up residents & targeted Hindu & Sikh temples. I'm also the MP, you fool. Sat Feb 07 14:29:50 GMT 2015
@ATurton_star in Dudley. Business as usual for me. Busy day of surgeries and meeting residents so far. Out talking to residents later. Sat Feb 07 14:28:05 GMT 2015
@SarahNormanCX @UnionKatie Yes. But policing operation will cost hundreds of thousands at a time whn cuts are forcing closure of our station Sat Feb 07 14:25:29 GMT 2015
Roads blocked, shops boarded up, hard-pressed staff losing pay. Awful. Just hope there's not the violent disorder we had last time EDL came. Sat Feb 07 14:23:13 GMT 2015
Great to meet @SarahNormanCX today to discuss plans for Dudley. I think she's going to do a great job. Lots of exciting ideas. Fri Feb 06 20:02:01 GMT 2015
@kayaburgess Fantastic news. Wld never have got the momentum without yr campaign. Was huge breakthrough. @thetimes should get lot of credit Fri Feb 06 05:13:30 GMT 2015
@kayaburgess Of course. Or a @BromptonBicycle. They are brilliant? Where are you off to? Somewhere warm I hope? Fri Feb 06 05:09:55 GMT 2015
@kayaburgess should be on your bike! Fri Feb 06 05:07:18 GMT 2015
@suziwaterhouse Very sad. The funeral is next week. Thu Feb 05 20:17:44 GMT 2015
@suziwaterhouse BTW, was Miss Fisher your headteacher? I saw her on Sunday. I also had the very sad news that Miss Edwards had passed away. Thu Feb 05 20:09:24 GMT 2015
@suziwaterhouse Thanks. I'm really sorry. Hopefully he will get more printed. Really sorry I can't get to the show. I am sure it's brilliant Thu Feb 05 20:08:37 GMT 2015
@suziwaterhouse librray apparently: http://t.co/AG63xi4058 I'm really sorry about this. I suggested he asks the publisher to print some more Thu Feb 05 20:05:40 GMT 2015
@suziwaterhouse I was about to get in touch. I asked dad for a book, but is out of print & he has no more copies. They have it in the ... Thu Feb 05 20:05:05 GMT 2015
This is bizarre. Auschwitz visitors have been on Tripadviser. One moaned the gates aren't depressing enough. Really. http://t.co/XMwr07o5Fo Thu Feb 05 19:59:11 GMT 2015
Know any community groups in #Dudley in need of help? @sedgleyPtrust is looking for projects to help with starting from March. Thu Feb 05 14:40:12 GMT 2015
.@More_Able Thanks! I loved every minute. Really pleased we cld it. Special thanks to @bbcnickrobinson for taking time meeting Dudley pupils Thu Feb 05 12:45:13 GMT 2015
About to take a group of Dudley's brilliant students around the Commons. Wed Feb 04 09:18:10 GMT 2015
@ERA_Legal I didn't say anything about them. I spoke about me in my seat. Mon Feb 02 23:12:05 GMT 2015
@ERA_Legal all of which - as a "libertarian Tory" you'd probably disapprove of or dismiss, preferring to leave it all to the market Mon Feb 02 23:05:16 GMT 2015
@ERA_Legal Because I work hard to improve education & skills, support local employers & to help bring new investment & jobs to the area. Mon Feb 02 23:02:32 GMT 2015
@DebraClaridge Yes, but Russell's Hal budget is over £300 million. Surplus was 0.001%. And a fraction of savings they have to find now Mon Feb 02 22:55:54 GMT 2015
@ERA_Legal I can think of plenty of businesses backing me in Dudley! Mon Feb 02 22:54:05 GMT 2015
.@montie there's also, obviously, a difference between disagreeing with a Tory peer telling people to vote Tory & attacking Marks & Sparks. Mon Feb 02 22:38:29 GMT 2015
@montie Oh come on. That would be brilliant British business Boots, moved by Monaco-resident billionaire to Switzerland to avoid taxes. Mon Feb 02 22:36:02 GMT 2015
@MikeWoods_Star Oh yeah. Sorry. How odd that I read that Mon Feb 02 21:45:52 GMT 2015
@simon_coxon oh yeah. How odd that I wrote that Mon Feb 02 21:45:01 GMT 2015
@AndyGilder @BrianatRodboro Nonsense. Not offended. But you are allowed to comment on it. He has free speech. So do I. That's how it works. Mon Feb 02 13:51:45 GMT 2015
@PatJHennessy I wouldn't put money on it. Mind you, as soon as Benteke gets back on form ... Mon Feb 02 09:19:44 GMT 2015
Crushed five-nil at Arsenal. Eight games without a win. Ten hours with no goal. Three points frm the drop. Resignation dogfight. Again! Grim Mon Feb 02 08:42:22 GMT 2015
Monaco billionaire moves British institution Boots to Switzerland to avoid tax & tells people to vote Tory? No way! Who'd have thought it? Mon Feb 02 08:38:22 GMT 2015

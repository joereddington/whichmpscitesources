In Paris yesterday at French Senate addressing politicians academics & diplomats on nukes; growing international interest in new approaches.
@Efrogwraig Quite right. We started from a worse place, but we're all in this together as someone once said!

@MikeCannon999 @NDJournal All rural councils shafted, including Devon which most certainly employs social workers and subsidises buses
Rural councils utterly shafted in today's funding announcement. Lowest earners, highest council taxes, poorest services. Big battles in Jan!
@JulianLangerMus Hi Julian. You can reach me on mail@nickharveymp.com - thanks.
On Thurs will press Govt on superfast broadband rollout to the 15% of N Devon homes considered hard-to-reach. Critical we aren’t left behind

Pleased to get in at PMQs on rural school funding. Ministers looking at it right now, so ball in their court. Teachers and parents watching.
Atlantic Array axe quite a shock.  Planning issue unresolved so no "victors". Maybe not last we'll hear of it. Anyone for tidal energy?

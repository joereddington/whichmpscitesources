Ed Miliband confirms a Labour budget will abolish the bedroom tax. Fifty days to go until #election2015 #votelabour Wed Mar 18 13:54:24 GMT 2015
Min wage will go up to at least £8 / hour under Labour says Ed Miliband in Labour's alternative to Tory lies and cuts. Wed Mar 18 13:53:35 GMT 2015
Can't believe that Osborne has the cheek to say 'we're all in it together'. Tax cut for millionaires and bedroom tax for poorest. #budget15 Wed Mar 18 13:02:04 GMT 2015
According to Osborne everyone is better off than they were in 2010. Reality is low pay up 44% & average worker £1600 worse off under Tories. Wed Mar 18 12:46:48 GMT 2015

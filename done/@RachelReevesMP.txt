Shocking story in today's @thesundaypeople about the impact of David Cameron and Nick Clegg's #bedroomtax  http://t.co/8kVpCDRJv7
@SarahLudford you needed LDs to introduce it - same for NHS privatisation, free schools and tuition fees.
@taniainwales @labourpress @MichaelDugherMP he is an exception, but nevertheless LDs are as much to blame as Tories for #bedroomtax
@SarahLudford what a ridiculous thing to say. Bedroom tax still on statute book and saying it only exists bcs of LD votes is not 'whinging'.
@MichaelDugherMP says on #bbcaq - Lib Dems haven't seen the light on the #bedroomtax they've seen the election on the horizon.
"THE bedroom tax is a step closer to being axed across the UK after a shock Tory defeat at Westminster yesterday" @Daily_Record #bedroomtax
@LabourSJ thank you Sarah. Let's hope the #bedroomtax is on its way out. Labour MPs will do all we can.

READ THIS: @LabourList: "Commons vote to exempt more people Bedroom Tax passes http://t.co/t6cvoQoZiV” #bedroomtax
Labour will now seek to amend the bill to scrap the #bedroomtax completely. But an important victory today for all those paying it today.
Vote on #bedroomtax 306-231. The bedroom tax is on it's way out!!!!
Voting now to scrap the #bedroomtax.

@eddwilson @Helen121 there will be a vote at about 1pm.
Nick Raynsford MP points out that real human concerns are ignored by #bedroomtax - families, carers and people with disabilities all hit.
Tory MP Sarah Newton just said she cared about the vulnerable as much as any MP. Yet Tories will vote to keep #bedroomtax today...
Debate on #bedroomtax underway. Huge number of MPs here. Let's hope this is step towards scrapping it. Labour will cancel it in 8 months.
Read this story in @guardiannews @TUCnews report on growth of low wage jobs which is driving up the cost-of-living  http://t.co/ZVmaM2c2GW
@leedswfoodbank just told me they've supported 40 people in last 4 months with food parcels bcs of #bedroomtax. Let's vote 2 scrap it today.
MPs starting to arrive in parliament this morning ahead of crucial vote on #bedroomtax later. Cruel and nasty policy that Labour will scrap.

Housing benefit will rise under Tories - by £12.9bn for people in work. Need 2 raise min wage, end abuse of zero hr contracts & build homes.

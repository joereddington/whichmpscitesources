The immigration debate is really an economic one.  It is about who we are letting in and what they can do to help us get ahead in the world.
We need to move away from an immigration debate purely about numbers, & start to talk about which individuals & skills we need in the future

...But one immigrant for every minute Labour were in power means their immigration policy has to be their second greatest crime.
Recently said wilful extension of welfare state into affluent middle class was greatest crime of Labour time in office. Still true...
Need to move away from immigration debate that is purely about numbers & start to talk about which individuals and skills we need in future

A great result for Conservatives in Somerset last night. Probably our best result in the country so far. Congratulations to all involved.
Lady T would be disappointed, if not appalled, to see Tories switching to UKIP rather than argue their case inside the Conservative Party.
Thatcher used to say she was born Conservative, would die Conservative and would fight for her beliefs inside the Conservative Party. #Ukip
Very flattered to have been asked to sit for a portrait by excellent young artist @VictoriaHeald. Very pleased with the result too!
Today was right & fitting exit for the political giant of our times. Simplicity & religious devotion of service spoke volumes about real MT.
Chancellor right to continue focus on deficit reduction; it is more robust & debt-free economies we will have to compete with in global race
With Eurozone predicted to contract further, Govt wd be wrong to risk UK long term econ stability in response to short term Eurozone failure
Just back from US where images of Thatcher haters were on TV. Deeply ashamed by their disgusting behaviour - Reminds us why we needed Mrs T.
Disgusted and ashamed by reaction of some elements of the left after Lady Thatcher's death. Why do the left have such a talent for hating?
I saw MT as a role model for those who wanted to break through traditional social barriers. 
My ConHome tribute to MT http://t.co/f572Hytgkh
Thatcher's willingness to take on conventional wisdom of her time & to confront failed & dangerous ideologies led to a freer & better world
Courageous, intelligent and patriotic, Lady Thatcher symbolised the triumph of principle over short term expediency.
Today represents a great loss for our country. Margaret Thatcher was  greatest PM of post-war era. A privilege and honour to have known her.
Honour to welcome soldiers of the Scots Guards to an amazing super yacht in Gibraltar. Thanks to our amazingly generous donors. #GiveUsTime

UK national security and the safety of our intelligence services should not be put at risk by outdated justice system http://t.co/rFKXL052mM
We can't cut spending on our nat security while still spending big on discretionary domestic programmes. Security is first priority of Govt.
We don't have a deficit because we don’t tax enough but because we spend far too much.
Defence has already taken its share of cuts. We must look to other areas, esp our huge welfare budget, for the savings we simply must find.
Great to speak to so many #CF at Albion Pub in Bristol this evening. Free market Conservatism is alive and well.
#ff @jsheappey  James is the newly selected Conservative candidate for Wells in Somerset.

AV Ref was given then lost. Lords Reform lacked public support or even interest. So Lib Dems sulk and oppose plans for truer representation.

Thanks to @RUSI_org and @OpenEurope for hosting great event this afternoon. Full text from my speech is here http://t.co/XDabEe1r
It is time to challenge the conventional wisdom on Europe. This is our country and its future should be ours to decide. http://t.co/XDabEe1r
Euro members are moving the EU goalposts to save their currency so this is time to forge our new relationship. UK trade still matters to EU.
We want a trading relationship with the EU but not the interference in our laws, politics or economy. That is the emerging consensus.
If Tories are to have credibility on EU issue, then we must have settled position that is clear, concise and consistent.
I, for one, hope to see "back to the common market" as the Conservative slogan on Europe at the next general election http://t.co/9bYJN87l
As an island nation with long trading heritage, we've never seen southern border of Greece as end of world - we've seen it as the beginning.
The EU is not an instrument of security. The EU's pretensions in defence and security verge upon little more than a vanity project.
...but if we are not given such assurances, then we have to be clear that the British people might want to leave. http://t.co/Z3WBSEeV
We ought to set out what our relationship with the EU should be and if consensus can be reached, we could stay...
There is a growing sense amongst the British people that the direction of travel of the EU is not in our national interest.
I'm speaking on "Britain and the EU - An Emerging Consensus?" in an @OpenEurope event at @RUSI_org at 2pm today. http://t.co/Z3WBSEeV

If green energy transmission is not included in Energy Bill, I'll be seeking to ammend it alongside colleagues from all sides of the house.
Green energy is very welcome but what about green energy transmission? Time to remove the environmental scar of pylons and overhead lines.
Cheaper access to libel and defamation laws is enough to protect when press (& Twitter users) over-step the mark. #ChangeNotChains #Leveson
Can't believe a great democracy like ours is questioning need for a free press - it is a fundamental pillar of it. #ChangeNotChains
Whatever #Leveson says, free press is essential counterbalance to power of state. self-regulation with teeth is answer. #ChangeNotChains
When Press break rules we need proper redress for victims. Libel must not be the preserve of the rich and famous. #ChangeNotChains #leveson
A free press is a necessary counterbalance to the power of the modern state. #ChangeNotChains #Leveson

Conservatives must appeal to optimism not resentment, opportunity not privilege. My Mail on Sunday article http://t.co/9fPefbXK
We must talk not only about aspiration but opportunity too. Aspiration that is not matched by opportunity produces anger and resentment.
Divided parties don't win - Conservatives set on serial rebellion should take note. Internal debate must be on substance not personalities.

“@scotsmandotcom: Two SNP MSPs quit over party’s decision to back NATO" Proof you can't reconcile an anti-nuclear party with a nuclear NATO.
Glad to see @UKIP following me. Getting our relationship with EU right is not in the party political interest it is in our national interest

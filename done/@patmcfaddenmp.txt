Mynets says he is committed to mutualism and believes it has role to play in financial services.  Stresses his recs specific to Co-op gvnce.
Myners: inconsistency between declared values and behaviour.  But also says co-op movement populated by people with excellent integrity.
Myners: "After 50 years of cultivated decline the Co-op is now at an inflection point."
Myners is certainly not pulling his punches in his evidence to TSC.
Cameron claims the Tories introduced patent box. Wrong. Introduced by Labour Govt to support R&D and pharma manufacturing in the UK.
Lord Myners will give evidence to Treasury Select Committee this afternoon, following publication of his report on reforms to the Co-op.
The man from Russo British Chamber who, for some reason, has been given platform at TSC says there is "a solid logic" to Russ psn....shocker

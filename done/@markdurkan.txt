@MorpheusNI All valid points - to add to frustration & sense of cynicism. Also need to address budget diffs w'out pretending only due to WR.
@MorpheusNI thats why @SDLPlive propd parallel scrutiny in Assembly while bill in HoC 2 expose implications: DUP dismissed "scaremongering"!
@MorpheusNI I assume minister afraid chunks of karaoke bill won't pass if fines/fait accompli submissiveness not a given etc..
@ayerightenough @SDLPlive argument 4 marginalised,sick,disabled...threatened by cuts not invalid! (Votes counted 4 recent BedroomTax bill).
@MorpheusNI =why weve opposed etc. & more cuts poss given scope of WR law & new WelCap/BudgetCharter.Only 22 MPs oppd WelCap (Lab suppd it)
@ayerightenough  only @SDLPlive voted ag Wel Cap & WelRefBil all stages & propd Assembly input 2 influence as WRB in HoC
@MorpheusNI BenefitsCap & WelfareCap r 2 different things. I opped both & 4 amendment 2 exc ChildBen fr BenCap. WelCap  only voted Mar14

I voted against WelfareCap. But Treasury could say this now frames future reality of no open-ended welfare spending so "fines now" relaxed.
Need utd exec push for Treasury fines lifted this year. Imposed (no DUP opp?) before "welfare cap"= treasury future bottom line on £welfare£

@charleslamberto @columeastwood @RonanMcCay a point I made that day as well as key points they asked me to reflect in the Commons chamber
In June I signed EDM177 Mandatory CCTV in Slaughterhouses. Now you can support @AnimalAid campaign & 📝No.10 petition http://t.co/U4mEI9fjSp
@BBCRadioFoyle my points 1)all parties should be opposing the Treasury fines 2)the budget diffs go back 2 other decisions not just WelRef
I just supported World Pancreatic Cancer Day on @ThunderclapIt // @OFFICIALPCA http://t.co/HdleOTYm52
@BBCNolan DUP crow thr opp 2 WelRef in HoC- real record? > no opp 2nd Rdg > suppd BenefitCap > this March voted 4 new WelfareCap=future cuts
@ShaleGasExpert @MarkHDurkan is my nephew - public information already! He says that he is "not the Man From Uncle".
@ShaleGasExpert On "misinformation" perhaps I should clarify that Environment Minister = @MarkHDurkan (& doing good job IMO)
@BBCNolan DUP didn't oppose 2nd Rdg WelRefBill, supported BenefitCap & oppd amndmt 2 spare ChildBen &  March voted 4 WelfareCap=future cuts
💐 Congratulations @MarkHDurkan and Anne and welcome to🚼 baby🍼 Lily Violet!😇
@EamonDelaney10 @BBCNolan @SDLPlive not pretending negotiations on tax&welfare/fiscal powers a teddy bears' picnic with sweet & free choices
@BBCNolan SF seem unaware of Welfare Cap http://t.co/qKJrwBKDIc could use it to say "U want discretion?U now have it but on a capped budget"
@BBCNolan New "Welfare Cap" passed this year (DUP for, SDLP against) could mean fixed cap for 1st time on total social security spend here
@BBCNolan DUP MPs supported "benefit cap" and agreed w Tory MPs talking about "lifestyle choices" when debating ESA etc for cancer patients
@BBCNolan DUP MPs voted in Commons against amendment (from Bishops in House of Lords) to spare Child Benefit from the "Benefit Cap"!
HoC #airstrike debate:well meant, well put arguments for&against~real issues & principles! Motion shallower than the quicksand it leads to.
@MartinMcAuley "bunker mentality" displayed by FM gets new meaning! Maybe golf's⛳"Play the ball where it lies" rule a message for FM & dFM?

PaisleyMemory 1/  June'96 Mitchell Principles @ start/Talks.IP only DUP 2 come n2 room.SenGM put pledge ? 2 IP. Loud tirade -"How dare you..
Signed #IanPaisley book of condolences in Guildhall, Derry. "The big man" - bigger in the quiet graces than the loud rages. Rest in peace.
#turnupsavelives 🌍 0.7 % bill @MichaelMooreMP passed 2nd Reading. Well done all campaigners,NGOs,charities, churches&constituents 4 lobby👏
#IanPaisley condolences to family.For years he bellowed against what he mellowed to accept. In latter role helped to ensure settled process.
How come WelRef fines on block grant can cripple Exec budget when it would take bigger cut as price for CorpoTax deal it wants?
🌐0.7%🎯 bill👍Not speaking as tactical need to avoid feeding debate in way that would help those who would "talk it out" #turnupsavelives
#turnupsavelives 🌍0.7%aidbill opened @MichaelMooreMP. Powerful by @OfficeGSBrown~passion, purpose & poignant on priority of world poverty.

@TovarichBelfast @SDLPlive @DUPleader Wrong. I advocate adhering to pars 11-13 Strand 1 GFA for proper use of petitions of concern.
"@GBSSupport: Today is International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Awareness Day" FASD_Trust event in HoC to mark the day
@DUPleader changes question "..DUP minister fit for office?" to "is Stormont fit for purpose?" Not fitting 2 abuse petitions of concern!

#bedroomtax Ive just checked the recorded division list. Only the 3 @SDLPlive MPs voted from north..
After 2 thumping defeats a 3rd vote called by Tories! Is Chief Whip bringing out a masochist in Michael Gove?
@roywhite_ni @SDLPlive @AndrewGeorgeLD SDLP 3 are the only ones I have seen here. 306 to 231 passed the 2nd Reading!!
#bedroomtax Closure Motion ~ voting now.If passed, we then vote on @AndrewGeorgeLD's bill to mitigate bedroom tax. 3 SDLP MPs here for votes
#bedroomtax debate @ChrisBryantMP "..example of policy-based evidence making" on IDS. We now seem 2b over 2 Tory filibuster 2 talk bill out
In HoC for #bedroomtax amendment bill.Unlike Wembley,a lot of tactics at play. But,beyond the politics,important issues at stake.

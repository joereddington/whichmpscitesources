Right. I'm off to debate the big issues of the day...at the Milton Arms in Elsecar #Barnsleyisbrill Thu Apr 16 22:21:27 BST 2015
This sums it up perfectly #BBCDebate  https://t.co/QRXiZGx8wj Thu Apr 16 21:44:02 BST 2015
I said it before and I'll say it again: Nigel Farage is a phoney bullshit artist #BBCDebate  http://t.co/54ab97LdeB Thu Apr 16 21:37:21 BST 2015
It's quite obvious that Farage is planning a deal with Cameron. More evidence that UKIP are more Tory than the Tories #BBCdebates Thu Apr 16 21:24:46 BST 2015
Well said Ed: "I'm not going to have a coalition with the SNP". #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:20:45 BST 2015
Miliband to Farage "you want to exploit people's concerns, not address them" on immigration #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:07:00 BST 2015
Farage: "when you lose an argument, you tend to abuse your opponent". He lost the argument so had a pop at the audience earlier.. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:00:37 BST 2015
Miliband right: A Prime Minister's first duty is to keep our country safe. Thu Apr 16 20:48:19 BST 2015
We're debating the big issues about the future of our country. And Cameron won't turn up, won't debate & won't defend his record #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:44:38 BST 2015
Farage attacks the audience. Good luck with that... #bbcdebate Thu Apr 16 20:34:52 BST 2015
UKIP are more Tory than the Tories. Farage has said he's the only person "keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive". Thu Apr 16 20:30:44 BST 2015

Dear David Cameron, I can see why you don't want to debate head-to-head with Ed Miliband. To quote your own Tory hashtag: You're #notuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:56:56 BST 2015
Farage talking about the "rich & the privileged". That's his problem. Always talking about himself #MoreToryThanTheTories #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:39:31 BST 2015
Clegg on tuition fees. I wished I'd had taped it #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:33:19 BST 2015
Miliband: "I believe in the promise of Britain where the next generation does better than the last" #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:32:03 BST 2015
David Cameron: "Never mind zero hours..." Yup. That's exactly your attitude #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:23:51 BST 2015
Just as happened during his Paxman interview, Cameron is so on the back foot #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:19:27 BST 2015
Great passion from Miliband about the NHS. You can't trust the Tories with the future of the NHS. Thu Apr 02 21:04:18 BST 2015
Only two people can be PM yet still Cameron won't debate Miliband head-to-head. He must think there's safety in numbers #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:16:42 BST 2015

@Stuho1mez 2/2 Down to a chap called Montesquieu... Also, US president is head of state. In UK, that's the Queen (our PM is head of govt) Mon Mar 30 19:01:54 BST 2015
@Stuho1mez 1/2 In our parliamentary democracy, the executive (Govt) is drawn from legislature (Parliament). US has "separation of powers"... Mon Mar 30 18:56:36 BST 2015
@Stuho1mez There are different systems, but in ours PM is leader of largest party/can form a govt by being able to pass legislation in HoC Mon Mar 30 18:49:46 BST 2015

Former Lib councillor and former Tory councillor now supporting me in Perth. What real tactical voting looks like. https://t.co/FdIB4LZKOC Mon Apr 27 18:07:22 BST 2015
Tactical voting anyone? Former Lib councillor, Lorraine Caddell & former Tory councillor Paul Leslie. Voting SNP. http://t.co/z9G06BwSel Mon Apr 27 15:06:36 BST 2015
Yes, quite. Even if people don't want him..... http://t.co/6c4RdDUUSG Mon Apr 27 14:13:53 BST 2015
Unbelievable! SNP on 54% in TNS poll. It's going to have to be a late, late Labour surge. Mon Apr 27 14:11:59 BST 2015
Today, I will show you what real tactical voting looks like in Perthshire. Watch this space. Mon Apr 27 09:38:08 BST 2015
Hold the Front Page  - SNP believe in independence. Inside our barking Tory says 'SNP worse than alien invasion'. Pickpockets, thieves, etc. Mon Apr 27 09:14:55 BST 2015
Surely some broadcaster somewhere will come to #PandNP? We still have a contest here. Last time I got all the attention. #feelinglonely Mon Apr 27 08:37:12 BST 2015
@Mtory2 @RuthDavidsonMSP They are simply appalled at the language used by UK Tory leaders and the depiction of Scots as 'thieves', etc. Sun Apr 26 16:56:34 BST 2015
One of the joys of campaigning at this time of year. No Tories in N Muirton but plenty of cherry blossom. http://t.co/vZnIwHX28e Sun Apr 26 16:41:44 BST 2015
Saw a bit of @RuthDavidsonMSP on TV.  She seems proud of the UK Tory 'Scots' campaign. Should hear what her now 'former' voters are saying.. Sun Apr 26 16:37:03 BST 2015
So it looks like the last full week of the election will continue to be all about the SNP. We can't ask for more. Fantastic. Sun Apr 26 16:31:37 BST 2015
No to a 'House of Losers'. The defeated must not join the donors and cronies. http://t.co/JKyEviI4Da Sun Apr 26 09:34:57 BST 2015
Demonised by the Westminster Tories. Frozen out by Miliband's Labour. Still we surge. #voteSNP Sun Apr 26 09:32:34 BST 2015
That late Murphy Slab surge is going to be awfy late as we now reach 48% in Panelbase. #slabsurge Sun Apr 26 09:17:43 BST 2015
Going to see @colinmacintyre with @SOH12 in Dunfermline. They're playing Loss in full. Did my 1st political interview with Kenny Macintyre. Sat Apr 25 19:19:40 BST 2015
It's almost as if SLab and the other W'ster parties have been washed away with the sheer SNP numbers. Everywhere!  #VoteSNP Sat Apr 25 16:34:32 BST 2015
Just incredible the scenes of all these people on the streets in Glasgow. We really do care about how we're governed in Scotland. #VoteSNP Sat Apr 25 16:30:34 BST 2015
Perth SNP on the High Street. Tory voters telling us they're appalled at the UK Tories 'Scots' campaign. http://t.co/OzbgfFpzRu Sat Apr 25 13:57:42 BST 2015
I once owned the 'skinhead' action man. Does that make me some sort of monster too? #dollgate Sat Apr 25 10:05:33 BST 2015
@John_5_1 Some nonsense about Tories 'winning here'. They're in fact losing badly. Sat Apr 25 09:57:05 BST 2015
Salmond a 'pickpocket'. Sturgeon 'cut hair of sister's Sindy doll'. We have now entered the electoral mad house. Sat Apr 25 09:55:45 BST 2015
Just tweeted this and it's been taken down. Scots Tories must now realise that their UK campaign is killing them. http://t.co/alROkcC2TI Sat Apr 25 09:51:40 BST 2015
Perth High Street today armed with the 'choice' quotes from the UK Tory campaign. Ordinary and decent Scots Tory voters will be appalled. Sat Apr 25 09:30:33 BST 2015
@GregoryA_Lane  Think they'e just genuinely appalled at the anti democratic tone of the UK Tory campaign with Scots as thieves and wreckers Sat Apr 25 09:27:06 BST 2015
What she would find if she came to Perthshire is Tories appalled at the UK Tory campaign and coming over to us. http://t.co/alROkcC2TI Sat Apr 25 09:18:04 BST 2015
This is where SLab are. Almost feel sorry for them. What a fascinating GE in Scotland. https://t.co/CiidQk7p2B Fri Apr 24 23:31:20 BST 2015
Is there any Scottish Tory response to the latest Tory UK campaign? Are they happy with the way Scots are being presented? #thieves Fri Apr 24 23:22:50 BST 2015
@Becksbridge @Ian_Fraser https://t.co/C3qTfAqMnt Fri Apr 24 23:19:12 BST 2015
The Tory campaign has just lost the plot entirely. The Scots are now all thieves and wreckers who have no legitimacy whatsoever. Incredible! Fri Apr 24 23:14:57 BST 2015
Always trying to suggest some good post canvassing wind down music. Sigur Ros. Second part of this is just fantastic https://t.co/aXI4YaL7sG Fri Apr 24 22:53:47 BST 2015
@Paula1902 @skellyphone They're like a plague of locusts. They all appear at once. Fri Apr 24 20:45:18 BST 2015
Are the Scots Tories fully behind these EVEL plans? Are they wanting people to vote for candidates who will then vote themselves 2nd class? Fri Apr 24 18:35:12 BST 2015
@iamvicrushworth Hello you. 'you're not for everyone' you say. You're right there. 'Au revoir'. Fri Apr 24 18:25:50 BST 2015

@Ramsay59 @SimonPia1 @GeorgeFoulkes Did I happen to mention that I am in fact 'Parliamentary tweeter of the year'. Very shy about it, etc... Fri Apr 24 16:49:08 BST 2015
Two 'meet the candidate' meetings today. Birnam institute at 2.30 & RDM Scone at 7. Also popping into the Perth Mosque after prayers #PandNP Fri Apr 24 11:44:40 BST 2015
@1ofthe63 Hello you. And it is so nice to meet you too. In the meantime.... 'au revoir'.... Fri Apr 24 11:32:46 BST 2015
'Vote Scottish Tory and I vow to diminish my role in Parliament'. A winning slogan? What a place to be in.... #EVEL Fri Apr 24 11:15:16 BST 2015
So, if you vote for a Scots Tory MP one of the first things they will do is to vote to diminish their role in Parliament. Wow! #evel Fri Apr 24 10:56:30 BST 2015
If it wasn't for what's happening in Scotland this 'dead-heat election' with its dreary '30 percenters' would be the most boring in history. Fri Apr 24 10:30:14 BST 2015

'I'm considering my vote on the basis of these various IFS assumptions about the reduction of the deficit'. Said no Scots voter, ever.... Thu Apr 23 22:20:07 BST 2015
Tonight, there are various opinion polls showing a narrow lead to one or other of the UK '30 percenters'. It's a 'titanic' battle. Thu Apr 23 22:07:22 BST 2015
Fantastic day in Fife today. Douglas on course to be the 1st elected SNP MP for my home town. Off to Perth now. http://t.co/Icv3GVNO49 Thu Apr 23 16:05:48 BST 2015

@StewartWhosie @RogMull Nope. doesn't cut it. Thu Apr 23 11:41:18 BST 2015
@StewartWhosie @RogMull You're a singularly unfunny 'parody' account. Next one's got to make me at least chuckle or you're blocked. Thu Apr 23 11:34:38 BST 2015
Murphy on the streets. Impending economic doom. Cybernats. Broon unleashed. Voters deserting SLab in droves. It's last Sept all over again! Thu Apr 23 11:31:26 BST 2015
Fantastic opening the SNP Kelty hub today with @RogMull. Imagine winning Brown's seat? With this crowd it's game on. http://t.co/hcIwPBFddo Thu Apr 23 11:28:22 BST 2015
Going down to help Fife colleagues today. Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath then Dunfermline and West Fife. On the old stamping ground. Thu Apr 23 08:46:44 BST 2015

@blairmcdougall @rosscolquhoun I know I'm not in the habit of mentioning it but did I happen to say I'm 'Parliamentary tweeter of the year'? Wed Apr 22 20:40:55 BST 2015

Just wish we had been given the opportunity to write Labours proposals on trident and fighting illegal wars. #writinglabsbudget Wed Apr 22 17:39:12 BST 2015
The 'writing the Labour budget' stuff is just great. And just shows how bonkers the Tory campaign has become. Wed Apr 22 17:25:21 BST 2015
It's great meeting all these people who are saying that they've already voted for me. Love Perthshire. #PandNP Wed Apr 22 10:30:40 BST 2015

Actually..... the ritual slaughtering of Willie Rennie on @ScotlandTonight is quite amusing. Tue Apr 21 22:56:19 BST 2015
Nicola on @BBCScot2015 Willie Rennie is on @ScotlandTonight. The people of Scotland are wondering who to watch. The Hydro or the phone box. Tue Apr 21 22:45:19 BST 2015
@GeorgeFoulkes Tories are spending money 'promoting' me? George, you're seriously cracking up. You need to take it easy. Your place is safe. Tue Apr 21 22:26:19 BST 2015
Once again on the General Election trail it is all about Scotland. I remember 5 years ago when we were on 19%. Scotland barely got a mention Tue Apr 21 22:17:57 BST 2015
@Dungarbhan @StFilansDream If anything it antagonised Lab voters so much it hardened the Lab vote. Tue Apr 21 21:02:42 BST 2015
@AlanRoden  Hopefully the Tories will give you something to write 'of' then. I even forget who their candidate is sometimes. Tue Apr 21 20:57:04 BST 2015
@AlanRoden Hold the Front Page. Daily Mail writes of Tory chances in Perth..... Tue Apr 21 20:48:09 BST 2015
@AlanRoden Would you perhaps describe the Tory campaign in #PandNP as 'dynamic'? Labour at least trying. Tue Apr 21 20:23:36 BST 2015
This was put on my Facebook. The year Runrig won everything in the Scots music awards & me speaking in pure Fife. https://t.co/XfORLNXhHd Tue Apr 21 20:19:44 BST 2015
The Tory campaign has been so underwhelming in Perth and N Perthshire that is is possible that Labour have emerged as my main challenger. Tue Apr 21 19:54:32 BST 2015
On campaign trail today real anger at the way the Tories are talking about Scots and our choice in this election. More Tories coming to us. Tue Apr 21 19:35:18 BST 2015

I thought Jim said that SLab would hold 'all' their seats. http://t.co/0i2lJG9pVP Wed Apr 15 16:16:23 BST 2015
@davieclegg Other than taking a photo at our office we've not really seen them. Talk it up though, need to present this as a close thing. Wed Apr 15 15:07:01 BST 2015
@davieclegg Don't know about that. There's Lab supporters being bussed in (as if they aren't a bit overtaxed) to help the Tory cause. Wed Apr 15 14:49:53 BST 2015
@ssamani The last Lib Dem candidate for Perthshire North (Victor Clements) is trying to get people to vote for the Tories in Perthshire. Wed Apr 15 14:38:35 BST 2015
Hold the (SLab/record) front page - Smith consensus dead. We ask 'these Tories - what are they like?' Inside we look at how the vow delivers Wed Apr 15 09:16:49 BST 2015
Going to see a bit of this now as they desperately try to hold seats. In hustings ask how they voted in last debate. http://t.co/Fui9gHQ4DG Wed Apr 15 09:12:26 BST 2015
Has to be the last tweet of the night. What a voice. What a musical legacy. RIP. http://t.co/ZiY3V785jF Tue Apr 14 23:59:48 BST 2015
@Dark_Blitz_2 @DonaldGatt Suppose that's true. Look, I want it to seem like a close thing here.... Tue Apr 14 23:34:32 BST 2015
@Dark_Blitz_2 @DonaldGatt Every election I'm told the Tory will win. I trebled my majority last time when we were on 19%. We're now on 52. Tue Apr 14 23:31:47 BST 2015
@Dark_Blitz_2 @DonaldGatt Yeah, my canvass returns are terrible, my 2,200 members mean nothing and the 52% in polls are really hurting.... Tue Apr 14 23:27:49 BST 2015
My Tory opponent obviously doesn't 'get' the benefits of social media. Not on twitter and just over 100 likes on Facebook. #PandNP Tue Apr 14 23:17:54 BST 2015
Ruth Davidson confirms that Scottish Tory MPs will vote themselves to become second class MPs. What's the point of that? #Scotland2015 Tue Apr 14 22:39:02 BST 2015
@mahmooa1 Where their leadership is much the same, lots of good people in Labour we work with. Encouraging them and help good behaviour. Tue Apr 14 22:35:00 BST 2015
@Vaughan_Wms @HelenMaryCymru @PlaidLlanelli We in the SNP are all looking forward to our new and numerous Plaid colleagues. Tue Apr 14 22:26:10 BST 2015
Tories are now Labour. Labour are now the Tories. Labour/Tory Tory/Labour. All the usual Westminster establishment same. #VoteSNP Tue Apr 14 22:18:19 BST 2015
Thank goodness something interesting is happening in Scotland. The rest of the UK GE is the dullest of W'ster establishment snore fests... Tue Apr 14 22:16:24 BST 2015
So, vote for Scottish Tory MP and they'll vote to limit their own rights in Parliament. Way to go Tories. Tue Apr 14 18:39:47 BST 2015
Popped down to S Perthshire to help @TasminaSheikh. Working to get the last SLab Parliamentarian out the big county http://t.co/kSO1zuxpRh Tue Apr 14 18:34:13 BST 2015
Fascinating watching the UK 30 percenters trying to get this GE back to the same old stale Tory/Lab spats of the past. Whole UK's moving on. Tue Apr 14 13:10:00 BST 2015
@GeorgeFoulkes Hi George. I actually though better of you than retweeting childish abuse. Tue Apr 14 10:39:11 BST 2015
Whose side is @Douglas4Paisley & @Margaret_Curran on in the Labour 'battle of the Scots cuts'? The cabinet they serve or the branch office? Tue Apr 14 09:51:34 BST 2015
@scotexpress46 Busy Bill. What with all these Labour activists coming to Perth to get people to vote Tory..... Tue Apr 14 00:06:40 BST 2015
Really enjoying Alex's book. Can see why the Tory columnists hate it. Tue Apr 14 00:04:29 BST 2015
@tullythedhog See what we can do..... Mon Apr 13 23:59:48 BST 2015
@tullythedhog Not bad, eh? Mon Apr 13 23:55:03 BST 2015
Fantastic and hilarious. Don't worry SLab. Everything's going to be ok.The Record will probably have you in the lead. http://t.co/nHMjL0R2bD Mon Apr 13 23:44:49 BST 2015
John Swinney gently reminding @cathyjamieson that Lab abstained when SNP MPs voted for the 50p tax rate. #Scotland2015 Mon Apr 13 22:49:01 BST 2015
Hold the front page (of the Record) 'Great day for Labour as they're on course to win seats". Inside - Chuka, Jim & Ed say 'we speak as one' Mon Apr 13 22:00:30 BST 2015
Looking at what the UK (real) Labour leadership are saying it looks like they're writing of Scotland to bolster up rest of UK support. Mon Apr 13 21:49:54 BST 2015
For the 6th month in a row the 'titanic' battle between the UK '30 percenters' has them tied on, well, just over 30%. #thethirtypercenters Mon Apr 13 16:11:42 BST 2015
'Pete for Perth News 6'. Project Fear 2 the return, meeting the candidate and they're appalled with Jim Murphy. https://t.co/u8bz0PtSJL Mon Apr 13 14:10:40 BST 2015
Oh dear. Jim's day is getting worse and worse. UK Lab look like they're disowning him. The Scots people already have https://t.co/vJ6pOZ48Oi Mon Apr 13 13:37:38 BST 2015
SNP 52% - trending throughout the UK. How's the Labour manifesto launch going? Mon Apr 13 11:48:34 BST 2015
Absolutely incredible. We break the 50% ceiling in latest opinion poll. https://t.co/BkiXJRsqir Mon Apr 13 11:06:58 BST 2015
The Courier on Labour shipping in activists to secure Tory votes in Perth. Incredible. http://t.co/VRRGKJFogP Mon Apr 13 09:25:57 BST 2015
You can almost feel those Scots journos positively bristling to get all over this Lab 'there will be cuts in Scotland' story...... Mon Apr 13 09:18:12 BST 2015
SLab campaign almost totally sunk as Ed Balls concedes there will be cuts in Scotland. Now got to spell out where. Mon Apr 13 08:36:46 BST 2015
Back in after more canvassing. People utterly appalled at the behaviour of Jim Murphy on that so called BBC 'debate'. More votes for us... Sun Apr 12 16:38:31 BST 2015
That was simply appalling @BBCScotlandNews But well done Nicola with dealing with that so measuredly. Can sense another poll rise after this Sun Apr 12 12:18:12 BST 2015
The Scottish people will be appalled at what they're watching on Politics Scotland and it will only drive them further towards the SNP. Sun Apr 12 11:59:12 BST 2015
Will we get another debate when everyone on the panel is against Lab and the Tories? #sunpolscot #leadersdebate Sun Apr 12 11:58:14 BST 2015
I'm afraid that the shouting down and talking over isn't going to work with Nicola. Approaching appalling, though. #leadersdebate Sun Apr 12 11:48:30 BST 2015
Looks like it's going to be Nicola vs the 3 other leaders and Gordon Brewer. #sunpolscot Sun Apr 12 11:42:39 BST 2015
@tanked_up_drunk See how you cleverly managed to associate me and the SNP with the nazis? Bet you're pleased, eh? Sun Apr 12 09:51:29 BST 2015

The '30 percenters' tied again at just over 30% in latest UK poll. There's one party with a clear lead in the polls. It's in Scotland #polls Sat Apr 11 23:49:05 BST 2015

@Ismcgr @scotonsunday I'm pretty sure that the SoS has committed a paragraph to deal with that 'conundrum'. Sat Apr 11 23:19:27 BST 2015

@jamesrobking Why is the Last Lib Dem who stood for Parliament in Perth asking people to vote Tory? Sat Apr 11 23:04:38 BST 2015
Was looking for SLab activists in Perth today but all I could find in the #snpout stall was Tory councillors and the last Lib candidate #sad Sat Apr 11 22:59:20 BST 2015

Great campaigning today. The too poor, too dependent SLab devomax message going down like a better together comedy night.... Sat Apr 11 17:44:36 BST 2015
@melody_player I treat it as such. Bit no, probably much to your disappointment. It's considered by ERS as 'safe'. Sat Apr 11 10:00:33 BST 2015
@RossFootball @Kenny_young Come and campaign here David. It's fantastic. Labour canvassers trying to get Tory votes. Sat Apr 11 09:55:03 BST 2015
@Kenny_young From the ERS. I'm fighting for every vote as if it's a marginal (it is). Yours is 'unsafe' by the way. Incredible. Sat Apr 11 09:53:08 BST 2015
Where no Scottish seat has changed hands since 2005 the Electoral Reform Society say there's only 5 'safe seats' this time. They're all SNP. Sat Apr 11 09:47:36 BST 2015
Come and ‘meet the candidate’ in Blairgowrie this morning. Promise to not slurp my coffee…. http://t.co/1x3EAytoKc Sat Apr 11 09:26:49 BST 2015
61% of Scots want devo-max. SLab doing all they can to antagonise and alienate that majority. Way to go.... http://t.co/vEQxlslnKR Sat Apr 11 09:00:08 BST 2015
With project fear 2 it looks like SLab have give up on Yes voters and are looking to No voters to save them. Desperate and doomed to fail. Sat Apr 11 08:54:04 BST 2015
The Tory Telegraph thinks my seat is safe (I never believe in such things) but every Lab seat in Scotland is marginal http://t.co/eEQ4CB6xUR Fri Apr 10 23:04:05 BST 2015
SLab resurrecting project fear because it worked so well with their (former) voters last time.... Fri Apr 10 22:23:05 BST 2015
Labour simply won't be able to scare the voters into voting for them. It doesn't work like that in Scotland anymore. #VoteSNP Fri Apr 10 18:17:09 BST 2015
Wow! Lab/Tory/Lib and the whole rotten Westminster establishment altogether again. Been there, seen it all before, won't work anymore. Fri Apr 10 18:07:13 BST 2015
I'm on a panel of 'grandees' at 11 on Radio 5. I'm a 'grandee' now, apparently. A 'wee-ee' more likely.... Fri Apr 10 10:12:31 BST 2015
Just when our polling couldn't get any more stratospheric Miliband and Balls come to Scotland. Fri Apr 10 09:12:27 BST 2015
Poor Jim. Turned Lab policy on its head. Picked a fight with London. Took Lab leftwards against his instinct. Still nothing in the polls. Fri Apr 10 00:14:37 BST 2015
All these polls are wrong, apparently. Lab/Libs/Cons are on the doorstep putting their dreary case. That'll sort the Scottish people.... Thu Apr 09 22:49:26 BST 2015
SNP almost on 50% in latest opinion poll. Labour down after Scottish leaders debates. Fantastic. No complacency. Fight for every vote. Thu Apr 09 22:11:06 BST 2015
Hope England haven't discovered oil because unionists will tell them their economy will end up a basket case and they'll only get poorer... Thu Apr 09 19:03:52 BST 2015

After 2 debates I still haven't got a clue if Lab will keep a minority Tory Gov't in power. Will any Scots journo ever demand a response? Wed Apr 08 22:33:15 BST 2015
Fantastic Nicola. The combined unionist barracking just made you seem all the stronger. Scotland will be proud of you tonight #LeadersDeabte Wed Apr 08 22:01:18 BST 2015

Not quite #MoustacheGuy but way to go dude. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:18:26 BST 2015
Why can't Labour accept they voted with the Tories on the further £30 billion. I was there? I was a teller in the vote. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:15:19 BST 2015

@DavidPBMaddox Not at all David. Nicola was fantastic. Did it have you thoroughly gripped all the way through? 10 mins of Willie Droney...? Tue Apr 07 22:11:15 BST 2015
We will remember that simply as the 'Moustache Debate'. Rotten format and sagged too often. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 22:06:34 BST 2015
Fantastic Nicola. You could hear the cheers. Lab needed to win but lost really badly tonight. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:54:26 BST 2015

Another incredible poll. SNP on 47%. Nicola's performance and nonsensical smears increase the SNP lead. https://t.co/XYaKdL2y3N Sat Apr 04 23:28:17 BST 2015
I've fought the Tories for 15 years in Perthshire and seen them off in every contest. I would never, ever want them in power. For a second.. Sat Apr 04 23:02:24 BST 2015
@BBCJamesCook @JimForScotland But why James? Will you at least rule out me and my MP colleagues? You've cast aspersions on all of us. Sat Apr 04 22:35:43 BST 2015
Fantastic. After this we need a diverse Scottish press more than ever. Don't leave it up to the SH and National. https://t.co/44WEWiOJD5 Sat Apr 04 22:34:05 BST 2015
What will SLab do now? They now know that they can't make things up on the back of their former 'better together' partnership. Not much left Sat Apr 04 22:29:54 BST 2015
@AllieRenison For that, read UK establishment. We are the most resilient population to their hyperbole, nonsense and absurd tactics. Sat Apr 04 22:26:04 BST 2015
The thing is we've been through this all before. Only a few months ago. Scotland is resilient and is ready for anything the UK can throw. Sat Apr 04 22:22:58 BST 2015
Today, was the day that Lab lost any possibility of pulling anything back in the polls. Fascinating day in the now totally discredited press Sat Apr 04 22:07:15 BST 2015
The last 24 hours have been the most interesting in this GE. The UK establishment vs an insurgent SNP. It's now defined and set. #VoteSNP Sat Apr 04 21:56:49 BST 2015
@Fitlike01 @paulhutcheon @vmg456 Probably looking for hotel receipts and the cost of tartan trews. Sat Apr 04 17:29:22 BST 2015
We should see if we can get #parlezvoustelegraph trending, eg. 'Je suis un Nat' - Telegraph translation - These Tories are great.... Sat Apr 04 17:01:22 BST 2015
Somebody actually came to our stall in Perth wanting to join the party in anger at the Francegate/Labour smears issue. Talk about own goals. Sat Apr 04 16:52:28 BST 2015
Head of Civil Service to examine the French nonsense leaks. Could be approaching category 'huge'. It's all about the SNP in #GE15 Sat Apr 04 16:39:46 BST 2015
@damilne1 Done it again. Sat Apr 04 14:03:32 BST 2015
Campaigning in Perth so couldn't be at the #ScrapTrident rally today. Here's what I said in our motion in the HofC https://t.co/cSBZivhOIA Sat Apr 04 14:01:37 BST 2015
It looks like all this French/Tories nonsense came from the Scotland Office. Would certainly make sense. There has to be an enquiry. Sat Apr 04 13:59:18 BST 2015
Lab could perhaps take this opportunity to tell us they would never leave a minority Tory Gov't in power if our joint numbers denied them? Sat Apr 04 09:43:48 BST 2015
It's the Perth Farmers Market this morning. Get some great local produce and come and say hello at our SNP stall. #PandNP Sat Apr 04 09:07:06 BST 2015
What a night for SLab. Perhaps a defining moment in the election campaign. https://t.co/SQSNXi9pi7 Sat Apr 04 08:45:19 BST 2015
If the @Telegraph had a shred of decency there would be a public apology and it would refer itself to the new press regulator IPSO. Sat Apr 04 08:41:06 BST 2015
In the good old days before Twitter and the interweb your super soaraway Scottish press would have got away with this Telegraph nonsense. Sat Apr 04 00:02:43 BST 2015
It seems the Telegraph's credibility lasted about an hour with this story. Would as well not bother putting its paper on the racks tomorrow. Fri Apr 03 23:17:47 BST 2015
What part of this does SLab not understand - French Consul General "Absolutely no preference was expressed by @NicolaSturgeon'? Fri Apr 03 23:14:44 BST 2015
The BBC. This story is third hand and vigorously denied. But we'll tell you it as if it's the truth anyway. Way to go the beeb #francaisgate Fri Apr 03 22:54:29 BST 2015
Gosh the UK establishment is rocked to its very core about the SNP surge. Bizarre stories now. What does this remind you of.....? Fri Apr 03 22:42:27 BST 2015
After the debate the '30 percenters' have risen to the dizzy heights of, well, ehm, 30 odd percent.. #the30percenters Fri Apr 03 22:40:29 BST 2015
@grierson9 I'm trying to encourage humour. This effort is a massive fail.... Bye though. Fri Apr 03 22:36:31 BST 2015
@Wellingtonsnag @loveandgarbage Hey! No. Don't be presumptuous. You tried. You stay. Fri Apr 03 22:27:44 BST 2015
@dinkusmas @loveandgarbage Can't win them all.... Bye anyway. Fri Apr 03 22:25:47 BST 2015
@Graeme_L Don't worry. Better late than never. Bye though. Just not funny..... #gottobefunny Fri Apr 03 22:23:54 BST 2015
@NiallBartlett Fantastic. See, this is how it's done. Creative's good too. Fri Apr 03 22:18:00 BST 2015
@TheHullster Nope. Not even close. Let's try and do creative good byes instead then. Bye, bye trollie, trollie, bye bye! #gottobefunny Fri Apr 03 22:11:12 BST 2015
@neiledwardlovat @euanmccolm Come on. At least try. Byyyyyyyeeeeeee! #gottobefunnyboos Fri Apr 03 22:04:01 BST 2015

@markmcdsnp @loveandgarbage @MhairiHunter With this booing stuff just presumed he was another SNPouter. Will check him out. Fri Apr 03 22:00:46 BST 2015
@These_Boots @loveandgarbage another fantastic effort. The bar is rising higher and higher. Fri Apr 03 21:26:30 BST 2015
The thing is I've actually had real booing. They once put Runrig on before Metallica in a festival in Finland. Can you imagine.....? Fri Apr 03 21:22:47 BST 2015
@markmcdsnp @MhairiHunter @loveandgarbage Now that is the best yet. Do you know this guy? Fri Apr 03 21:17:24 BST 2015
@blueliberal1 @loveandgarbage Not even trying. Bye. Fri Apr 03 21:07:56 BST 2015
I think I've managed to get people to be humorous with this booing. Fantastic. Might even unblock @loveandgarbage Fri Apr 03 21:02:08 BST 2015
@weetabixface The most creative yet. But I did say it had to be humorous. Oh, alright then.... Fri Apr 03 20:58:08 BST 2015
@jakenelwood80 @CemetryGates89 @loveandgarbage Fantastic. 2nd best tonight. Fri Apr 03 20:56:39 BST 2015
@16ossie Sorry. It has to be humorous booing here. Nice long one though. Bye. Fri Apr 03 20:55:39 BST 2015

@wisbottle @loveandgarbage Good one..... Fri Apr 03 20:44:29 BST 2015

@Muchintended Guess what? byyyyyyyyyyyeeee. Fri Apr 03 20:41:08 BST 2015
@twlldun @loveandgarbage My apologies. Fixed now. Fri Apr 03 20:40:30 BST 2015
@ExcelPope I never thought I'd have the opportunity to say 'au revoir' for an unfunny boo. Fri Apr 03 20:39:52 BST 2015
@atelierimages The best yet. They're all getting better, though. Fri Apr 03 20:38:40 BST 2015
@derekstillie @Ricardo_Bald @loveandgarbage Nah. Doesn't work for me. Sorry, bye. Fri Apr 03 20:35:50 BST 2015
@Mr_Eugene_krabs @loveandgarbage Very good. Like it. You definitely stay. Fri Apr 03 20:35:08 BST 2015
@CorporateGorila Good. Shows initiative.... Fri Apr 03 20:34:41 BST 2015
@CyranodEcosse Brilliant. See, it can be done with humour and style. Fri Apr 03 20:25:55 BST 2015
@damilne1 I'm having a great time.... Fri Apr 03 20:24:51 BST 2015
@teletextpage152 I failed to enact my first blocking for an unfunny boo. Will now do it now. Fri Apr 03 20:24:03 BST 2015
@GillPen1969 @DearMeNo @DrScottThinks Not even trying.... Fri Apr 03 20:22:04 BST 2015
@Seasider06 @loveandgarbage That's the way to do it. Fri Apr 03 20:21:36 BST 2015
@SartoMutiny Au contraire. You tried... Fri Apr 03 20:21:20 BST 2015
@wurzie82 Well, I'll block once more. Fri Apr 03 20:19:22 BST 2015
@fraserbennett Oh alright then.... Fri Apr 03 20:18:39 BST 2015
@Gary_Bainbridge @loveandgarbage That's just long. Not funny. Bye. Fri Apr 03 20:18:02 BST 2015
@lordbonkers @loveandgarbage You definitely stay. Even if it's a poor boo. Fri Apr 03 20:17:37 BST 2015
@HickeyWriter @loveandgarbage Very good. You stay. Fri Apr 03 20:16:56 BST 2015
@Iseult1 @loveandgarbage Great.... Welcome Fri Apr 03 20:16:20 BST 2015
@shocker38 @loveandgarbage Apparently it's 'humourous' or something. Only seen a couple that are even slightly amusing. Fri Apr 03 20:16:02 BST 2015
@Dan_k68 Nah. Totally unimaginitive. Bye Fri Apr 03 20:14:54 BST 2015
@struantheruin Good. Fri Apr 03 20:14:32 BST 2015
@5goalthriller Doesn't work for me. Bye Fri Apr 03 20:14:07 BST 2015

@TiggerTherese You can stay. Fri Apr 03 20:12:12 BST 2015
@ChristinaMaroc @loveandgarbage Not in the least amusing. Bye bye. Fri Apr 03 20:11:37 BST 2015
@eatsleeplaugh Not funny! bye Fri Apr 03 20:11:05 BST 2015
Hi friends, this guy @loveandgarbage likes booing. Why don't you oblige him? boooo! Fri Apr 03 20:10:42 BST 2015
Ah, I get it, the booing is a 'thing'. Well make it funny or you're blocked. Fair enough? Think this guy's behind it @loveandgarbage. Fri Apr 03 20:07:43 BST 2015
Another plug for 'Pete for Perth News'. All you need to know about the campaign in #PandNP https://t.co/rfxPClCpn6 Fri Apr 03 19:55:34 BST 2015
@Seanm1888 We don't really 'do' Labour in Perthshire. Douglas Alexander did once stand here though. Fri Apr 03 19:30:17 BST 2015
Fantastic response in Coupar Angus today (modesty forbids me telling you the canvass result). Everyone proud of Nicola in the leaders debate Fri Apr 03 19:22:06 BST 2015
@CllrNorthice Hello you. Nice to meet you too. 'Au revoir'. Fri Apr 03 13:17:06 BST 2015
@volpagirl I'm very grateful Tricia. You're part a great list of top Perthshire nominees which I will reveal next week. #PandNP Fri Apr 03 12:36:03 BST 2015
'Pete for Perth News' 3. Fantastic Nicola, talking Tory, and making Perthshire the 'tourist centre of Scotland.' https://t.co/rfxPClCpn6 Fri Apr 03 11:18:45 BST 2015
@gordonsmithnz Funny you should ask. Was on the tannoy in last 2 elections. Will probably go on again but don't tell @Pammy315 Fri Apr 03 09:09:56 BST 2015
Sending best wishes to @Jim4DundeeWest who's pulling out of the election due to ill health. One of the good guys in Scottish Labour. Fri Apr 03 09:04:07 BST 2015
Think there will be a bit of a spring in the step when out canvassing today after Nicola's commanding performance last night. Fri Apr 03 08:48:56 BST 2015
Even the Daily 'Torygraph' believes Nicola won. https://t.co/dHIo9d6QEY Thu Apr 02 23:34:09 BST 2015
The UK just now - Scotland, SNP, Scotland, what do we do about Scotland? those Scots, etc. Let's keep it that way. #bbcqt #votesnp Thu Apr 02 23:19:51 BST 2015
@scott993 @scottishlabour You've got a wee bit to learn about Perthshire politics. Don't worry none of your leaders can answer that Q either Thu Apr 02 23:14:54 BST 2015
Can you imagine the time when Scotland is no longer centre stage in UK politics? All you have to do is vote for one of the UK parties.... Thu Apr 02 23:09:05 BST 2015
Hello @bbcquestiontime . See all these debates about the SNP how about letting us on to discuss them? Pathetic but typical. #bbcqt Thu Apr 02 23:03:37 BST 2015
@scott993 We've said we would vote against any attempt to secure a minority Tory Gov't. Will Lab join us if our joint numbers denied them? Thu Apr 02 22:58:35 BST 2015
Why does Ed think we would ever vote for Labour austerity when we oppose Tory austerity? #theirHofCmotion Thu Apr 02 22:36:00 BST 2015
@scott993 And what does the Labour candidate for #PandNP think? Thu Apr 02 22:31:46 BST 2015
The biggest loser tonight is SLab. If Scotland wants to be heard on the UK stage and our national agenda progressed vote SNP. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:13:44 BST 2015
Yougov poll has Nicola clear winner. The most impressive leader in UK politics. Nothing will be the same again. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:10:57 BST 2015
We will now never go back to the failed Westminster establishment hegemony. And a good thing too. New politics is coming. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:03:53 BST 2015
Nicola you were fantastic. By far the most impressive leader and showed what we can achieve as long as we're in the UK. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:51:53 BST 2015
Incredible all these people in England asking how they could get Nicola. The people of Scotland just need to return SNP MPs. We're coming. Thu Apr 02 21:45:20 BST 2015
'Let's hope there's loads of SNP MPs keeping him (Ed) honest'. Fantastic Nicola. The only way to get them to do the right thing. #VoteSNP Thu Apr 02 21:42:46 BST 2015
After listening to this debate 2 party traditional Westminster establishment politics is now over. Welcome to the new age. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:32:25 BST 2015
In the 'being normal' table. Nicola way ahead. Ed and Farage rock bottom. Stop scaring the British people by looking at the camera Ed.... Thu Apr 02 21:08:33 BST 2015
'If you want a party that will control immigration, that's me'. The Labour Party. Not Farage. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:05:06 BST 2015
I don't agree with Dave, Ed and Nick and I definitely don't agree with the xenophobe. There is a way beyond the W'ster establishment #debate Thu Apr 02 21:02:33 BST 2015
This is good. The Westminster establishment parties and the xenophobic attachment are not happy. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:55:27 BST 2015
What a contemptible politician Farage is. Britain, vote for anyone here rather than his rotten xenophobic party. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:52:37 BST 2015
Isn't it great to hear more than the usual Westminster austerity establishment voices in a debate about our future in the UK? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:40:46 BST 2015
Well done Nicola. Labour talk anti austerity but why did they vote for £30 billion Tory austerity? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:32:51 BST 2015
Ed's now beginning to scare me. Look into the eyes, look into the eyes. ##LeadersDebate Thu Apr 02 20:24:40 BST 2015
Ed doing the 'looking at the camera thing'. Will work for a bit but can feel the nation tiring of it already. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:21:43 BST 2015
@DrMoragKerr Leanne as Mother of Dragons is the best. Thu Apr 02 17:07:07 BST 2015
This 'Game of Seats' is really cool. The battle for Westminsteros. Nicola is the Queen beyond the Wall.

This from Nick Griffin. We will never let these fascists get a foothold in Scotland's public life. https://t.co/DokzshcKI5 Thu Apr 02 16:32:30 BST 2015
I think we have to presume that Lab are preparing to leave a minority Tory Gov't in power even if our joint numbers denied them. Incredible! Thu Apr 02 13:43:53 BST 2015
@RoflYssMtt @blairmcdougall @johnmcternan It's the key question. They won't even attempt any sort of answer. Thu Apr 02 13:21:45 BST 2015
No one in Lab will tell us if they would leave a minority Tory Gov't in power if our joint numbers denied them. Maybe someday they'll answer Thu Apr 02 13:16:46 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall I've given you the courtesy of an answer. Everybody here will see you have no intention of answering my question. Why not? Thu Apr 02 13:08:38 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall I've answered it 8 times now. Why won't you give me the same courtesy for my question? Does Bobby Davro know what you'd do? Thu Apr 02 13:03:56 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall Hi Blair, I gave you the courtesy of an answer. Will you now afford me the same courtesy? Thu Apr 02 13:00:04 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall Bored with this now. We will IMPROVE an HR bill. Are you now going to answer Q about minority Tory Gov't. 6th time now? Thu Apr 02 12:56:02 BST 2015
Hi @blairmcdougall @johnmcternan Can either of you tell me if Lab would leave a min tory Gov't in power if our joint numbers denied them? Thu Apr 02 12:53:16 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall For 6th time we'll always improve an HR bill. 4th time asking now. Will Labour leave a minority Government in power? Thu Apr 02 12:49:26 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall You obviously know what's in this bill? Is it of the 'near federalism" variety? What more powers are being devolved? Thu Apr 02 12:43:28 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall Let's see if there is a bill or if it is one that is 'near federalism'. How about my Q now? Leave min Tories in power Y or N Thu Apr 02 12:34:33 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall I wouldn't be too sure if Lab would even bring such a bill. What about leaving Tories in power? Y or N? No one's watching.. Thu Apr 02 12:28:15 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall We'll always vote to improve a 'HR' bill. Now we're at it. Would Lab leave a minority Tory Gov't in power. Y or N Thu Apr 02 12:21:48 BST 2015
Sort of think that the Scots are beyond being told that they would uniquely fail if they were in charge of their own affairs. #ffa #fmqs Thu Apr 02 12:16:11 BST 2015
For this unionist full fiscal autonomy stuff to work the UK parties have to convince Scots that they are dependent, too poor & too wee #fmqs Thu Apr 02 12:12:27 BST 2015
'The only alternative to Labour, Tory, Liberal austerity is the SNP'. Spot on by the FM. #fmqs Thu Apr 02 12:09:04 BST 2015
As we get to the leaders debate the austerity '30 percenters' getting close to 35% in their 'titanic' battle. https://t.co/m8Lr5fGAro Thu Apr 02 10:11:38 BST 2015
For all SLab's anti-Tory wailing the Scottish people will neither forget nor forgive them for their 2 year Tory indyref alliance. #votesnp Thu Apr 02 09:02:42 BST 2015

Were Labour really walking the streets of Glasgow with a cardboard cut out of David Tennant? Incredible! Wed Apr 01 23:00:26 BST 2015

Really pleased I was able to get along to the #VisitEastPerthshire @bepta AGM tonight. Bringing visitors to beautiful East Perthshire. Wed Apr 01 22:18:13 BST 2015

'Pete for Perth News' 2. Tactical voting in Perth (Tories 1 and Tories 2) and it's baltic in Oakbank. https://t.co/JF9HhphE1d Wed Apr 01 12:08:39 BST 2015
Lab claiming SNP 'support Tory austerity' is incredible. It was they who actually voted for £30Bn of extra Tory austerity a few months ago. Wed Apr 01 11:05:13 BST 2015
This is almost a carbon copy of the 2010 election campaign. Where's Mrs Duffy when you need her? Wed Apr 01 09:28:21 BST 2015
@AngusMacNeilSNP I'm glad that the agreement to have you as Foreign Secretary is still 'hush, hush'. Wed Apr 01 09:24:55 BST 2015
@traquir @Scott20Marion Nope, and they won't. Want to 'reform' it whilst seeking places and making it work. Tue Mar 31 23:13:10 BST 2015
I think the Scottish Tory posh boy columnists are fantastic. What would we do without them? Tue Mar 31 23:01:13 BST 2015
Tomorrow in your soaraway Scottish press. Hold the Front Page. SLab landslide - 12 seats held. Inside - we ask, is it all over for the Nats? Tue Mar 31 22:51:34 BST 2015
Tories on a dismal 13% in the STV poll. Finding it difficult to find Tory voters in what was their main target seat last election. #PandNP Tue Mar 31 22:33:01 BST 2015
The W'ster establishment parties trying to bore the British public into submission with their uninspiring campaigns. Give us a break already Tue Mar 31 22:28:24 BST 2015
The Westminster establishment parties seem to be fighting the same old type of election campaign. Not sure that's going to work this time. Tue Mar 31 20:51:52 BST 2015
Cold comfort for Labour when they're only getting stuffed as opposed to gubbed in the opinion polls. #onlypolls #nothingforgranted Tue Mar 31 18:54:06 BST 2015
1st edition of 'Pete for Perth' news. Keeping you informed of the SNP campaign in Perth and North Perthshire #PandNP https://t.co/SmeWZzw82u Tue Mar 31 14:59:06 BST 2015
@scottishlabour @melanie_ward I sort of recall Labour MPs voting with Tory MPs for a further £30b of Tory austerity. Maybe I imagined it... Tue Mar 31 14:32:49 BST 2015
Labour figures running a mile from their 'Farage mug'. Any of them going to say it was a good idea? Tue Mar 31 12:28:04 BST 2015
Labour still going on about 'sensible reductions in public spending'. That's 'sensible' austerity whatever that is. Tue Mar 31 12:27:01 BST 2015
Last election #PandNP was flooded with Tory Ministers and UK journos. No one coming this time. You'll get a warm Perthshire welcome..... Tue Mar 31 09:28:17 BST 2015
Always talked of 'encouraging good behaviour' in Labour. There are good people beyond their austerity-lite leaders. https://t.co/wwXvEFGzTM Tue Mar 31 08:55:55 BST 2015
Looks like the @Daily_Record has decided to be nothing more than SLab's mouthpiece in the GE. Good luck with that strategy.... #sales Mon Mar 30 23:31:05 BST 2015
The big question (if any Scots journo seeks to put it). Would Labour leave a possible Tory minority Gov't in power if numbers deny it? Mon Mar 30 23:05:59 BST 2015
Still thinking that Labour will leave a minority Tory Gov't in power if they could be stopped? Will any journo really seek to get an answer? Mon Mar 30 22:49:57 BST 2015
@SimonPia1 Do you have any idea how ridiculous Labour look to people under 40 going on about something from the 70s? Incredible. Mon Mar 30 22:30:44 BST 2015
In 79 I was a Lab supporter. I was just back from my first Rock Against Racism event. I was 17 and a 'gobby' young radical. Labour left me. Mon Mar 30 22:19:23 BST 2015

Tried to get this disgraceful motion 'not put'. Would be up to Hague to withdraw. He won't. Thu Mar 26 13:08:23 GMT 2015
A nasty, vindictive, cowardly Tory attack on a modernising Speaker who has held their Gov't to account. Let's hope they're defeated today. Thu Mar 26 12:51:52 GMT 2015
@melody_player So just sort of shut up and mostly let them get on with it? Representing constituents just doesn't work that way in the SNP. Thu Mar 26 10:18:17 GMT 2015

Not taken again at PMQs despite a good deal of the exchanges being about the SNP and Scotland. They just don't want to hear from us. #pmqs Wed Mar 18 12:45:06 GMT 2015
PM(SNP)Qs today. Scotland will remain centre stage at Westminster as long as the SNP remain centre stage in the polls. Wed Mar 18 08:58:44 GMT 2015
We didn't agree on much else but @Margaret_Curran and I certainly let our racist UKIP MEP know what Scotland thinks of him. @TheStCDebate Tue Mar 17 23:15:06 GMT 2015
Doorstepped on arrival from the BBC and STV for tonight's debate. Think they're more interested in @DavidCoburnUKip Tue Mar 17 19:03:54 GMT 2015

If Tories emerge as the largest party but combined SNP/Lab votes can keep them out surely Lab would work with us to keep the Tories out? Tue Mar 17 16:16:16 GMT 2015
Public meeting in North Muirton in Thursday. Come along for a bit of old style speechifying and election Q and A http://t.co/emAlqj02hq Tue Mar 17 15:54:07 GMT 2015
Social media and 'conspiracy theories' are responsible for SLab's collapse. Fantastic 'conspiracy theory' from SLab.

UKIP racist @DavidCoburnUKip seems to confirm he'll turn up to the CofS debate tonight. Tue Mar 17 09:29:43 GMT 2015
Wow! That was some exchange between @kayeadams & @WingsScotland. BBC really sensitive about how they've covered this 'largest party' stuff Tue Mar 17 09:26:08 GMT 2015
@andrewgmorton Lord Trollingham. Tue Mar 17 09:12:07 GMT 2015
Fantastic piece by Ian McWhirter on the latest 'we won't work with the SNP' nonsense. http://t.co/GLak10muhl Tue Mar 17 09:08:45 GMT 2015
The only people 'voting with the Tories' are the Labour Party. #austerity #trident #welfarecap #etc Tue Mar 17 09:02:49 GMT 2015
It is the sheer desperation in this 'refusing to work with the SNP' that is the defining feature in this latest Labour nonsense. Tue Mar 17 08:54:24 GMT 2015
Poor old @kdugdalemsp all over the place on 'working with the SNP' what a mess they're in with this. #GMS Tue Mar 17 08:42:57 GMT 2015

@GeorgeFoulkes George. Is it the ermine? Mon Mar 16 23:10:03 GMT 2015
@GeorgeFoulkes This man is an unelected Labour Lord. That's actually quite easy to believe. Mon Mar 16 23:07:03 GMT 2015
Now all Labour have to do is to convince the Scottish people that Miliband (on his own) is the 'man' for them. Simples.... Mon Mar 16 22:56:49 GMT 2015
Jim's got his 'angry head' on arguing his 'largest party' nonsense. Labour melt down is something to observe. Mon Mar 16 22:46:15 GMT 2015
Surely a Labour wouldn't allow a minority Tory Gov't if our combined numbers could stop it? Surely they wouldn't? Surely? Oh, right.... Mon Mar 16 22:38:41 GMT 2015
It almost seems like Labour are intentionally doing all they can to irritate and alienate Scottish voters. And they're doing it so well.... Mon Mar 16 21:58:58 GMT 2015

Looks like @DavidCoburnUKip will be at the debate in London tomorrow. I'll use my time to encourage all there to vote for anybody than UKIP. Mon Mar 16 21:25:52 GMT 2015
Labour are so hopeless they can't even rule out things properly. #votesomebodygetsomeoneelse Mon Mar 16 18:23:59 GMT 2015
The titanic battle between the 30 percenters is now real. The 2 great Westminster establishment austerity parties now stand on 60% combined Mon Mar 16 16:41:37 GMT 2015
Labour better not be working towards keeping the Tories in power. Scotland would never forgive them (again). Mon Mar 16 15:41:08 GMT 2015
Did anyone seriously think there would be a 'coalition'? Mon Mar 16 15:39:57 GMT 2015
If Labour are serious about 'abolishing' the Lords they should say that from now they won't put any more of their cronies and donors in it Mon Mar 16 09:08:57 GMT 2015

@ToniGiugliano @DavidLinden @Margaret_Curran @UKIP We can be passive and let them get on with it. Or we can challenge them. Latter for me. Sun Mar 15 23:02:50 GMT 2015
@GaryForbes11 @Margaret_Curran @DavidCoburnUKip @UKIP Absolutely and totally. Sun Mar 15 22:59:58 GMT 2015
@ToniGiugliano @DavidLinden @Margaret_Curran @UKIP No. What they want is to leave them unattended. We have to take their pernicious views on Sun Mar 15 22:59:15 GMT 2015
@MhairiHunter @Margaret_Curran @DavidCoburnUKip @UKIP Sorry Mhairi. The UK parties have let UKIP go without comment. I never will. Sun Mar 15 22:51:49 GMT 2015
Me @Margaret_Curran and Lord Purvis are on a panel with @DavidCoburnUKip on Tuesday. Let's jointly make the debate about @UKIP and Scotland? Sun Mar 15 22:47:31 GMT 2015
@sunshineonleith @hazelcowan What? Vote Tory? Sun Mar 15 22:37:27 GMT 2015
@hazelcowan @sunshineonleith Hi Hazel. Lots of Lab voters backing me to keep the Tories out. Surely you approve? Wouldn't want a Tory MP? Sun Mar 15 22:35:34 GMT 2015
@sunshineonleith Believe me. The anti-Tory sentiment is still the predominant feature in places like Perth. Why would we want them back? Sun Mar 15 22:30:58 GMT 2015
The main feature of this weekend's campaigning is that there is tactical voting going on. People voting SNP to keep the Tories out... Sun Mar 15 22:22:43 GMT 2015
@GGerbin @SNPfail @scotsw12 That's almost profound.... Sun Mar 15 17:43:16 GMT 2015
@SNPfail @scotsw12 Hey, always happy to oblige my 'pouty' friends. You know the phrase..... Sun Mar 15 17:31:33 GMT 2015
At last the voice of anti-austerity from @mikeweirsnp. Of course we didn't vote for Labour's austerity plans @cathyjamieson. Sun Mar 15 12:05:42 GMT 2015
Apparently, I'm on a panel with this racist clown in London on Tuesday. http://t.co/qVmWBoXzrl Sun Mar 15 10:10:18 GMT 2015
Surely SLab MSPs know it will be all over for them if their MPs rule out SNP 'deal' leaving Tories in power? Scotland would never forgive. Sun Mar 15 10:03:02 GMT 2015

This is UKIP. They must never be pandered to and all their racist assumptions must be challenged.  http://t.co/iaIKSceKoR Sat Mar 14 15:49:26 GMT 2015
Great campaigning in Perth too. Tories have 2 stalls. Their own and the uber-unionist, anti-SNP, Tory front groups. For some reason.... Sat Mar 14 15:38:10 GMT 2015

Please @UKIP stand against me in Perthshire. Even though you'd lose your deposit I promise to make a good part of my campaign against you Sat Mar 14 09:35:22 GMT 2015
Let's make sure we never, ever have a representative from the racist, anti-immigrant UKIP again in Scotland. Scotland is better that this. Sat Mar 14 09:29:44 GMT 2015

It's changed days when the SNP on 46% for Westminster barely registers a mention. Fri Mar 13 09:24:57 GMT 2015
You would never have #bbcqt discuss the Tories, Lab or Libs without one of their representatives there. Why only the SNP? Thu Mar 12 23:13:32 GMT 2015
Because we are the news, but because we are not THERE, everybody trying to speak on our behalf. Simply appalling, but consistent. #bbcqt Thu Mar 12 23:09:48 GMT 2015
Uh, oh! Let's talk about the SNP on a prime time BBC political programme without, ehm,,,.the SNP. Lots more of this ahead folks, #bbcqt Thu Mar 12 23:02:33 GMT 2015
Yeah, yeah, so @AngusMacNeilMP might make the odd speech or two... https://t.co/yVYQMH5RFz Thu Mar 12 22:45:02 GMT 2015
SNP on 46% in latest opinion poll. That's 6 months of stratospheric leads for W'ster. Taking nothing for granted, fight for every vote, etc. Thu Mar 12 22:40:15 GMT 2015
Absolutely drookit in our canvassing in Perth tonight but warmed by that anti-Tory anti-austerity, vote for Scotland, glow... Thu Mar 12 21:41:16 GMT 2015

Geez! @BBCScotlandNews still trying to set the agenda on immigration. Maybe try 'broadcasting' and poll Scots on satisfaction with BBC news? Thu Mar 12 18:34:34 GMT 2015
@iancawsey @3solipsists Fantastic. That's why you do all the chat with the audience.... Thu Mar 12 14:02:10 GMT 2015
@ScotForUK Just dandy. Great opinion polls. How's my friends the #pouters? Thu Mar 12 13:51:17 GMT 2015
@Roy1Batty @patronsaintofca @JamesKelly indeed. And nothing like his name sake either. Thu Mar 12 13:21:39 GMT 2015
@JamesKelly correctly stating that SNP MPs didn't vote against Lab's austerity motion but we certainly didn't vote for it either. Thu Mar 12 12:33:47 GMT 2015
Scottish Liberals supporting their Tory led Gov't to the hilt. The closest you'll get to political suicide in Scotland. #fmqs Thu Mar 12 12:19:36 GMT 2015
@SimonPia1 @kdugdalemsp I thought Jim said SLab support the council tax freeze? Thu Mar 12 12:14:49 GMT 2015
For SLab to make this 'anti devo-max' stuff stick they have to convince the Scots that we''re totally dependent on W'ster and too poor #fmqs Thu Mar 12 12:11:49 GMT 2015
Dear @kdugdalemsp the SNP W'ster group oppose Tory austerity but we won't vote for Lab austerity either. Thu Mar 12 12:04:47 GMT 2015
We were 'too wee and too poor' for independence. Apparently we are too 'wee and too poor' for proper devo-max  too. #VoteSNPgetScotland Thu Mar 12 11:41:32 GMT 2015
The true nature of UKIP is revealed with their plans to scrap anti-racism laws. Don't vote UKIP anywhere in the UK. Thu Mar 12 09:57:50 GMT 2015

It was almost shameful that they wouldn't let the SNP speak at PMQs today when it was all about us. #scotsnight Wed Mar 11 22:52:00 GMT 2015
It's the absolute delight that unionists take in what they see as 'bad news for Scotland' that is turning Scots to the SNP in droves. Wed Mar 11 22:46:46 GMT 2015
So we're back to being uniquely too wee, too poor and stupid. And unionists want Scots to vote for them. Sigh... #VoteSNPgetScotland Wed Mar 11 22:20:42 GMT 2015
I had a little piece of jacket pocket related theatre if I had got called at #pmqs today. Alas, it will have to wait. Wed Mar 11 12:48:09 GMT 2015
That was PM(SNP)Qs today. Scotland is all they talk about. Let's keep it that way. #VoteSNPgetScotland #pmqs Wed Mar 11 12:43:43 GMT 2015

@BBCJamesCook @BBCWeeLucyAdams Hi James. Did the BBC ask in 'your' debate whether this was immigration into Scotland or the UK? Tue Mar 10 10:39:46 GMT 2015

@PeteWishart
@meljomur Yup. Visited many times in last few years. Last one standing in the 'Arab spring' and got to hope it can make democracy a success.
On way to Tunisia on Westminster Foundation for Democracy business ahead of this weekend's crucial presidential elections.
Overall winner of the Perthshire Chamber Star Award - Merlin ERD. With all the other winners. http://t.co/cWLBEnuL61
Special award to Saints chairman, Steve Brown and manager Tommy Wright at the Star awards tonight. http://t.co/ppGySodJQ0
At the Perth Chamber of Commerce Star Awards and the awards are about to start. Good luck to all our wonderful Perth businesses.
@AlynSmithMEP I'm going out tomorrow. Meeting MPs and candidates. You still going to be there?
Congratulations to all my colleagues in what is a fantastic new cabinet. http://t.co/021IgfOLIO
On the day UKIP get yet another MP, me on the 'UKIPification of the UK' in the Arrest Warrant debate this week. https://t.co/a87Ac3oXrs
Don't know whether to risk life and limb and a foul mouthed outburst by counting out the Scottish Labour MPs in the lobby today.
My advice to the W'ster establishment parties is don't attack UKIP in the House like they do the SNP. It'll help them like it has helped us.
New UKIP MP, Mark Reckless, is speaking in the Health Service bill in the House. He sounds like John Major on helium.
All SNP MPs are in the HofC to vote to protect the Scottish NHS from English NHS privatisation.
White van man vs Islington Labour. http://t.co/PGbGfOK367
Altogether now. UKIP on the BBC, UKIP in the news. UKIP don't like immigrants, don't like pro Euro views. Today - all day.
Can't be many MPs at the Scots politician of the year as we had the devolution debate today and it's TTIP tomorrow. Wasn't invited anyway.
Apparently Gordon Brown wins the best Scot (not) at Westminster and he's not there to get his reward either. #onlybroon
Westminster, the Tories and the vow. Not in a good place. http://t.co/yarnqesokX
Great speech from @MorayMP the usual attempt to shout him down from the dinosaurs. Will be very different after May.
The Tories still saying we are subsidy junkies and they wonder why they're more or less doomed in Scotland.
The dinosaurs are ragin'. #barnettreviewdebate
Who's this dude? #fmqs
What a fantastic First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is going to be. She's having an excellent first day at FMQs.
@PoliticalYeti Possibly. It's all about the arithmetic when it suits them. We already should have a minority party rep on Liaison Committee.
@PoliticalYeti He didn't really say that!? I've been fighting to get us a place for years. Every time ignored. Incredible.
The UKIPification of the UK will continue apace today when their number of MPs is doubled. Expect them to be pandered to further. #UKipUK
The only parties allowed on this HofC Liason Committee are the Gov't and the Labour Party. It is exclusively Westminster Establishment.
Hague more or less confirms that the Gov't will abstain on the Barnett 'review' debate today. If Lab joins the SNP we can vote this down.
@gordonwasok On the order paper of today's business in the House of Commons.....
@RitchieReview Abolished......
The Tories want the vow reviewed. The SNP will vote to stop them today. But there's only 6 of us. We need many more.
Good luck to all nominees for the e-politicain of the year tomorrow. As a W'ster winner I never deserved 1 and am not in the least..the b...
Nigel Farage is picking up on my term 'UKIPificaition' I'm either really on to something here or I'm barking up a euro-phobic tree.
Gov't say they won't vote on the 'Barnett Review' debate tomorrow. If Labour join us we can make Westminster stick to the vow.
In Commons debate I challenged the UK parties to take on UKIP not pander to them but I fear the UKIPification of the UK will grow apace.
I'm speaking in the European Arrest Warrant debate in about 10 mins. Expect some irreverence served up with views on the growing UKip UK.
You would think that Jackie Baillie would realise by now just how embarrassing these contributions are? Apparently not....
@HeraldHolyrood ?
Speaking in the arrest warrant debate. 'The Tories are in and out of the arrest warrant like some Kipper doing the hokey cokey in Kent'.
Tomorrow, 100 Tories have a debate to have Barnett 'reviewed' & the vow conditional on EVEL. The SNP will vote to have the vow honoured.
PMQs today. Two broken UK leaders who can barely get over 30% in the polls will shout even louder at each other.
European Arrest Warrant back again today. What's the chances we might see some more absurd scenes in the mother of Parliaments?
@DavidMundellMP @NicolaSturgeon How about the @ScotlandOffice started serving all of Scotland? Not just No supporters.
Well, that SLab hustings was enlightening/said absolutely nothing. Not sure though.
SLab haven't a clue what they want from the Smith commission. Not sure though.
I think SLab are for and against nukes. Not sure though.
I think SLab are against tuition fees. Not sure though.
I think SLab are against the council tax freeze. Not sure though.
'Being in better together was a mistake' - Labour leadership candidate. At last they're staring to get it.
@WingsScotland Cool. Got it. Cheers. Got to see my good friend Jim.
@WingsScotland No Sky. Where is it online?
Does anyone know if you can get @BBCScot2014 in the imperial capital yet? Me and lots of London Labour bods are dying to know.
@DAaronovitch Agree with you on this one. Tories pandering to UKIP has been disastrous for the Tories. Will be equally bad for Labour.
Boo, for the last time.
Boo, again.....
YES! Come on Scotland.....
England fans really belting out the anthem of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 @scotgp Not in the least. I'm genuinely intrigued. Never met an anti-indy green before.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 @scotgp Hey look at you. A green and all that. Knock yourself out. An anti-indy one?
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 OK, you've pricked a flicker of interest. Who do you vote for?
Stevie May's coming on. Stevie, Stevie May. #perthsaints
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 Hey, stay nice. Thought we had something good going on here.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 Lost interest.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 Hey, don't be shy. Liberalism has a long proud tradition. So the Westminster Tories tell me.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11  You Liberal then? Was listening to Danny today.
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 You a Tory or Lab no sort?
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 Because we always get such a great press?
@lizardvanilla @Pseudoscience98 @KatePotts11 Was a private members bill that was never going anywhere. The real vote was previous October.
Boo.
Come on Scotland. 45 minutes left. Fortunes have changed with that number.
@BBCScot2014 Are we in London getting to see it? Lots of my London Labour colleagues will want to tune into the BBC family of nations.
The Tory/UKIP race to the bottom on who can be hardest on immigration has now been joined by Labour. #yourUK #UkipUK
Our amendment to the Barnett 'review' motion on Thursday. Big day for the vow. http://t.co/LOwh39ziJD
Listening to Danny Alexander at the #pressgallerylunch He thinks he'll hold his seat. The rocks will melt with Liberal promises more like
@Margaret_Curran Do you not think your hatred of the SNP with stuff like this helps account for your perilous electoral predicament?
For some reason I'm going to Danny Alexander at the press gallery lunch. Must have seemed a good idea at the time.....
Hey, we're getting Labour's border guards after all! http://t.co/ZFPp8YrQ6k
'When two tribes go to war' (well one tribe actually). http://t.co/XTvEy0SFr7
@davieclegg How about 'Great news for Labour as they hold on to 5 Westminster seats'?
Just wow! New opinion poll for the Record would give the SNP 52 Westminster seats.  http://t.co/6v4NulFzLf
Where Alex Salmond will donate his FM pension to charity here's what former UK PMs are up to. http://t.co/YSH58NqzYs
It seems the job of the branch office manager is to offer 'opinions' to the London Labour HQ. Hilarious interview. http://t.co/2UTlnEDW6v
@Margaret_Curran @NicolaSturgeon See your first question Margaret? Can you tell me why you didn't vote on the 50p tax rate in the HofC?
@ssamani @HippyScott @davieclegg If we're both standing next May we'll get a sense about what the good people of P&NP think.
@jimsrob Yup. Was getting my Farage all  mixed up with Tory Ministers and assorted backbenchers.
@Henbell Also - by not pandering to their agenda by talking up the value of immigration and EU membership.
@Henbell I did. Hard to tell them apart just now....
@HippyScott @ssamani @davieclegg By exiting stage left courtesy of the electorate......
@davieclegg More interesting headline, perhaps? 'Vowing' again David.
Lots of good things in the Record poll more believe that immigration is'a good thing' than 'bad thing'. And only 35% would vote for #brexit
Big day for the Tories on Thursday. Do they vote on the 'hated' Barnett formula or do they go to Rochester to do battle with UKIP?
@davieclegg I suppose another way of putting it is 3/4 of Scots WANT another poll on independence?
Labour, for and against trident, universalism, austerity, the council tax freeze & the welfare cap. Make the Liberals almost look consistent
@paulhutcheon @AlexSalmond Here's another. Altogether now. 'Welcome to the Hotel Caledonia, such a swanky place (such a swanky place).
Message from London Labour HQ is that branch office applicants have to be quiet on reserved issues.
Labour the for and against nukes party. What do we want, etc.......?
@HTScotPol @newsundayherald @jimmurphymp I did some ironic cheering.
There is something remarkable going on in our fantastic nation and it's just been ratcheted up another gear. What a conference. #snp2014
Fantastic speech from Nicola Sturgeon. Sets us up perfectly for the General Election. Never known us in such good heart for a W'ster contest
@LeanneWood getting a great response from SNP conference. http://t.co/wJEzZHZhwo
@SimonPia1 We offered to work with Labour after last election to stop Tories. Labour preferred Tory Gov't.
@barrendero Sorry. So hard to tell you apart these days.
@barrendero What's Labour's?
Said to conference that the 6 SNP MPs had to take on 640 unionist MPs and 780 cronies & donors from the Lords in the W'ster establishment.
@SimonPia1 'I don't start with a knee jerk, lets increase your council tax' - Murphy. About 20 different Lab positions on the freeze.
Murphy's nothing for something. Must be about Labour's 50th position on the council tax.  http://t.co/BVibltd9OL
Here we go. The Barnett 'review' debate on Thursday will see the vow further undermined. http://t.co/XH3vbYnR9x
Day 2 of conference in Perth. The SNP will spend some £1.7m in Scotland's conference city. City was buzzing last night.
It's still going on! What a standing ovation for Scotland's most remarkable politician. http://t.co/xrRndwFWdw
'Labour didn't trust Scotland now Scotland doesn't trust Labour'. Brilliant and true from Alex.
Scotland will become an independent nation. Emotional Perth Concert Hall. http://t.co/sQrO4NZ8Jr
Well done @StewartHosieMP deputy leader of the UK's third largest party.
The whole of the SNP a conference is on the BBC Parliament channel.
Perth buzzing as the UK's only party of majority Government and its third largest gets down to business in Scotland's conference city.
The scale of Murphy's enduring popularity in the wider Labour 'movement'.  http://t.co/OZO7yLta2m
Ruth Davidson has destroyed the prospects of both the Liberals and Labour by their coalition with them. Brilliant from the FM.
That was just embarrassing and cringeworthy from Jackie Baillie. No other way to put it. Don't know how Lab think this endears them to Scots
Contrast the lighthearted and jovial FM with the dreary and totally wrong tone taken by Jackie Baillie. What's wrong with Scots Labour.
The city of Perth getting ready to host the UK's third largest political party.
Next Thursday we will hear the true voice of the Tory backbench on a debate about 'reviewing' Barnett and EVEL. Will be a big moment.
A fair assessment of where we are with the vow. Tories not interested and we'll see it in the vote next week. http://t.co/sJfBaYFu02
It's almost like unionists are going out their way to antagonise the voters they managed to get to vote No in the last weeks of the campaign
Great packed meeting at the Alyth SNP branch. We're all wondering when we get our papers for the Tory 'primary'? http://t.co/5mbkuDjgaK
@PoliticalYeti @BBCScot2014 Can't believe you James. It s a vote-able debate with a motion signed by over 100 backbenchers. Geez.
I'm sure that a programme as well informed as @BBCScot2014 is aware there's a debate about a Barnett 'review' in the HofC next week.
That IFS dude on @BBCScot2014 is something else. All of these convenient 'flaws'.
What is it about Scottish Labour and their on going support for Tory welfare cuts? First the welfare cap, now this. http://t.co/YYcsDBBdoF
@connorbbruce Yup.
We now go over live to the comet landing. https://t.co/hZU0ebSPCs
@connorbbruce More than happy to. Give the office a call to fix a date.
I'm speaking at the Alyth SNP branch meeting tonight in the Lesser Town Hall at 7.30. New and 'old' members most welcome.
The worst name I heard for Ed today was 'Weird Goofiband'. I'll not tell you who came up with it because it is so childish.
@AlanRoden @Neil4Scotland I wanted them to back the socialist/Blairite/ nuke loving/welfare cap voting/anti universalism one.
Lab/UKIP alliance anybody? Could almost see it where they're going. http://t.co/Zl7YYu62lD
It's getting to the stage that I'm starting to feel sorry for Ed. This is terrible. http://t.co/kfSxxeVizN
Expect lots of other 'flaws' on Barnett as the vow is further eroded. All being softened up for the debate on Barnett next week.
Tories 3 points ahead of Labour in latest UK opinion poll. Lab under 30% again. Will their crisis became a catastrophe soon?
@CATHOrgPerth Done, and will come and see you soon.
The blame game in the Westminster establishment on the arrest warrant debacle is really funny. They're all to blame!
@RobbieGibb @daily_politics The Scots Parliament is sitting and the 3rd largest party in the UK is having its conference. Not interest you?
@IanYoungEsq @GTMelhuish I could never support a nukes supporting, welfare cap voting, ID cards promoting, Tory austerity party, ever.
@katie_dearden @IanYoungEsq @GTMelhuish No. Was a Private Members Bill going nowhere. Jim didn't turn up when it could have been defeated.
@GTMelhuish @IanYoungEsq I'm from a working class background and was in the Labour party. That party left me a long time ago. #snp
@IanYoungEsq @GTMelhuish @katie_dearden Though, totally accurate. If he and his Lab colleagues had turned up we could have defeated it.
@IanYoungEsq @GTMelhuish @katie_dearden Yeah, like your hero Jim did, when the bedroom tax could have been defeated?
@GTMelhuish @IanYoungEsq @katie_dearden Yeah! The only thing is most people in unions now support the SNP. #difficult
@IanYoungEsq @GTMelhuish @katie_dearden That's a real shame. What do you think I should do....?
The Murphy avatar on twitter takes up a third of the profile photo. That's commitment to the Blairite London Labour cause.
@GTMelhuish @IanYoungEsq @katie_dearden Ehm! Maybe someone using the language of recently departed branch office managers and senior MSPs.
It's great that I have a union that has a say in the branch office London Labour leadership contest. Imagine for a moment that I didn't?
My union - the Musician's Union - is supporting Neil and Katy in the branch office London Lab contest. So stick that up you, Lab students!
Apparently we're on recess again. Must be because W'ster has been working so hard for the greater British community. #RochesterandStrood
I feature in a UKIP add. First and only time for everything I suppose. http://t.co/wkneqKNTmd
A ringing endorsement from Blair is probably the last thing that Ed needs.
The rest of the EU don't know whether to sing 'please don't go' or breathe a sigh of relief that the surly, semi detached UK is heading out.
Fascinating day in the HofC. No idea what the Tories were up to but they've done zilch to stall the progress of the UKIPification of the UK.
@cllrdmeikle Has to be said - I like these type of days.
So, after all of that I think we've voted for the European Arrest Warrant by proxy. Never known shambles like that in the House.
We're now voting on - the question be not now put. If it's lost it's then put. Hope that's clear. This is Westminster.
I tried to move - the question be not now put -  now be put. Almost got away with it. This is Westminster. #EAWshambles
The great European Arrest Warrant omni-shambles goes on. We're now debating whether the question be not now put! This is Westminster.
9 votes and we could have put this nonsense out of its misery. #EAWshambles
They're arguing amongst themselves on the front bench now. #EAWshambles
Utter shambles. We are not debating and voting on the European Arrest Warrant. The Speaker has ruled.
Labour on 29% again in latest UK opinion poll. It'll be the 25% strategy soon. #edstays
UKIP protesting outside parliament. What do we want? - mean minded euro sceptic intolerance. When do we want it? - NOW!
No-one has a clue whether we're voting on the European Arrest Warrant or not. Seems to sum up the Tories whole approach to Europe.
EAW debate. 'The UK is now heading to the EU exit door like some stumbling drunk cursing something incomprehensible'.
Speaking in the Euro Arrest Warrant debate today. 'The UK's approach to this is like it's doing the Hokey Cokey at the UKIP christmas party'
@GrahamGGrant But the sandwich. You've got to consider the sandwich. You Daily Mail guys are something else....
@GrahamGGrant @MailOnline Where's my sandwich?
Seems like it's been quite an extraordinary day in Catalonia. The people have spoken and their voice must be respected.
25 year ago we were playing Hamburg when the wall came down. Will never forget the flood of Trabants and the sheer joy of the East Germans.
@johnbhoy63 Just is, FO decree. We therefore rotate each year with Plaid.
For those watching the cenotaph service. Elwyn LLwyd is laying a wreath 4 the joint SNP/Plaid group. We don't get to lay a wreath separately
@FraserDuff And, 'don't worry about Scotland, Murphy's going to save it for Labour'. Was hilarious.
I always think it's nice to give a hearty 'au revoir' to my newly blocked community of friends.
@gasbaggrt And you seemed such a nice guy too. What was that again? Ah yes. 'Au revoir' mon bon ami
So the great European Arrest Warrant debate & vote tomorrow won't actually include the European Arrest Warrant! #RochesterandStrood
@PlopGazette @LadyCarolMax @MrsCupcake79 @cccammy1 @AgentP22 Et tu, mon ami. All together now - 'au revoir, au revoir' etc.
Incredible! Not one shadow cabinet member prepared to come out to defend Ed Miliband this morning. But hey, he's got John Macternan!
@MrsCupcake79 @cccammy1 @AgentP22 And to you my friend the heartiest of 'au revoirs'.
Would be embarrassing blow for Murphy & his London Lab backers if he didn't win convincingly in each part of Lab's electoral college/circus
Thinking of all my Catalan friends today as they vote in their independence referendum.
@Del_ivered @jimmurphymp A fond au revoir to you mon ami, the noo!
@Daily_Record What! All by himself? He's a one man end of universalism, poverty ending super 'socialist'.
It's something when even the 'left wing' of the Labour Party would end universalism now. What a road they've travelled.
Today I can exclusively reveal who is taking on Danny Alexander. http://t.co/BVtKC4Bfto
In Newcastle with my old Dunfermline neebors reliving our old clubbing days going to see these guys. http://t.co/qSKcI1TlUI
@ScotlandOffice Shouldn't you be doing more tweets gloating that 'you won' the referendum? The Scottish people will really appreciate that.
The 'Barnett review' debate is scheduled for the 20th in the HofC. Part 2 of the undermining of the vow.
The greatest anti-war song ever? https://t.co/NJJsGEBee6
The biggest problem in the Lab leadership 'issue' is no-one seriously can see a PM Miliband. Lab voters laughed at that during the indyref.
@PLPhilD @WingsScotland Might see you there.
Practising my chest beating daddy dancing for the Future Islands at the O2 tonight. https://t.co/4UZ4fTKiSu
I just want to say that Ed Miliband is a true tribune of the people, not in the least weird, understands Scotland totally. He must stay...
A typically thoughtful and reasoned speech from @EilidhWhiteford in the #LivingWageDebate
Fantastic speech from @HywelWilliamsMP on  the living wage debate. @EilidhWhiteford up soon. #LivingWageDebate
@tracyrennie3 There are no Liberals in for the #LivingWageDebate
@IRobertsonSNP There would be very little chance of that.
@scottishfirst Nope. Willie Bain. A second has now appeared since my last tweet. At least they're paying attention.
There is only 1 Scottish Labour MP in the chamber for the debate on the living wage. Thought it was a priority issue?
0 per cent of people in Scotland think Ed is doing 'very well'. #edcrisis http://t.co/lT16p7Uy7R
Labour won't move to relieve themselves of the disaster that is Ed. They're stuck with him and will pretty much sink with him.
Trying to imagine Murphy at FMQs. From Labour UK cabinet to being mauled by Nicola Sturgeon as branch office opposition manager.
Asked Hague if the smaller members of the 'family of nations' vote to stay in EU but England votes to go would we be dragged out? We would.
Hey, it's ok. Apparently Teresa May is burning an effigy of @NormanBakerMP on the Home Office bonfire. #salmondeffigy
Labour have a motion on the top rate of tax rate today. Wonder if they'll abstain on the vote like they did the last time?
PMQs today. 2 millionaires who can barely get over 30% in the polls shout at each other about who's the crappest leader
Today in your wonderful UK HofC - immigration, Europe exit, immigration, tax cut for the rich, immigration, etc. #ukipuk
With these Labour opinion poll ratings Murphy should do the right thing and resign.
Tories under 10% in latest opinion poll. That silent majority remain stubbornly silent, and pretty much a minuscule minority.
Another incredible opinion poll. SNP on 57% for Holyrood. Labour on 23. http://t.co/CA18w9X3Jw
Nominations have closed in the Labour leadership contest. And the winner is (as if we don't know) - dramatic music -  Murphy! Cheer/boo!
Murdo Fraser has 3 nominations in the 'politician of the year'. That must be to recognise all these electoral contests he's won!
Other than the necessary 'Scots at W'ster' there are no nominated MPs in the 'Scots politician of the year'. Unleash the dinosaurs!
Hey, I've got a spare vow if any UK parties want one? It's pretty solemn and all that.
Expect lots of resignations from Liberal Ministers as they try and pretend that the last 4 years of Tory coalition didn't actually happen.
@axnicho @severincarrell Labour asking their voters to vote Tory would effectively finish them off as any sort of force in Scotland.
How low in the opinion polls do UK Labour have to fall before they look at the bleedin obvious - the Ed problem?
Latest UK opinion poll, Tories 30%, Labour unbelievably under 30 on 29%. Labour's Scottish meltdown might be spreading to the whole UK.
Scotland likely to be dragged out of Europe against its will because of deep rooted UKIP-ery on the free movement of people in the EU.
Europe just sick and tired of a surly, unengaged UK which is half way out already. http://t.co/QkS8rMMyCr
It's the end of an earwig. http://t.co/ZA4reZ92g8
Message to my London Labour Scottish friends - you've got to resign soon if you want a place in the new regime.
Arise Lord Darling. For services to Bettering Togethering.
Not sure it Labour shouting at their former voters 'shut up and admit you're wrong and lost, you separatists' is going to work for them.
it's more of an 'in conversation with Gordon Brewer' than a hustings on @Sun_Pol_Scot. Awful!
Is Gordon Brewer standing for the Deputy leadership too? hearing more from him than anybody else here.
It's a veritable Murph-fest out there. The Scottish media and Jim should just get a room....
Was asked for my favourite ever song for Total Politics. Always comes back to this. https://t.co/3V3jBdCLfM
If anybody sees @AngusMacNeilMP tonight tell him I now have more followers than him.
@migrationman So these unions saying they're supporting one or other candidate just now is essentially meaningless then?
@migrationman Aah! That clears it up then......
Not in your super soaraway Scottish Sunday press any other candidate for the stewardship of the branch office of London Labour.
@migrationman So how come some unions have already declared who they're supporting?
@newsundayherald Just brilliant.
The unions do ballot their members before they decide who they're supporting in one of these ramshackle Labour leadership contests, right?
Tomorrow. In your super soaraway Sunday Scottish press. Murphy, and then more Murphy. The others should just all go home.
@scotonsunday @KennyFarq And those in between. Haha! Just fantastic.
I now actually look forward to reading a Scottish newspaper. @newsundayherald
@newsundayherald Yup. Them and most of the rest of the Scottish press.
With indy ahead in the opinion polls shouldn't Project Fear be reformed. People won't scare themselves.....
@GeedonBruce They can initiate anything they want. The IP Bill was very important to our economy. I served on the committee in the HofC.
@GeedonBruce @alisonthewliss @alstewglasgow There was one only a few months ago. The Intellectual Property Bill, now Act.
@GeedonBruce @alisonthewliss @alstewglasgow Legislation can be initiated in the Lords and we have had a few Lords bills in last few years.
Murphy's campaign team is quite simple. Unquestioning BBC coverage and nearly the rest of the Scottish media.
If Murphy's in an apologetic mood how about Iraq, the welfare cap, trident, ID cards, 90 days detention, foundation hosps, T fees, etc?
If Labour were even half way serious about scrapping the House of Lords they should now stop stuffing it full of their cronies and donors
Off to see @DougieMaclean with the RSNO tonight at Perth Concert Hall tonight as part of his fantastic Perthshire Amber festival.
Good to see my good friend, Jim Murphy, paraded as this even tempered soft spoken, paragon of virtue. On all stations.... #foff
Poor old Neil and Sarah on #gms left to hang as London Labour manages the Murphy succession.
Given their new relish for replacing their leadership maybe the men in the shiny grey suits should go a tapping Ed's shoulder. Last chance!
Even Nick Clegg is more popular than Ed Miliband in Scotland. It can not get worse than that.
First Q for any Lab candidate - Do you believe that Scotland should be dragged out of Europe if a majority in Scotland want to stay in?
@Disillusioned__ Scoon..... With an extra ooh.
Labour's main problem is that the Scottish people will neither forget nor forgive them for so passionately campaigning with the Tories.
Was at another packed new members meeting in Scone tonight. For some reason everybody there was in particularly good spirits. #labmeltdown
Another Westminster opinion poll putting the SNP on 43% with Labour on 27%.
Anas to stand down too, The Labour 'family' needs to go to counselling.
Scotland certainly has 'issues' with the Labour Party. #thatpoll
Tory/UKIP on 12% in Scotland. Almost 50% in the UK. It's that old different countries thing again. It's why we need maximum devolution.
Quite extraordinary. SNP on 52% for Westminster. Labour would be left with 4 seats. http://t.co/S27WRlGOaO
Asked Hague if the 'more powers' debate will be considered without condition and on its own as Smith requests. It won't, apparently. #evel
Said to the minister that this monstrous race to the bottom with UKIP on immigration is now leaving people to drown in the Mediterranean
As a member of the Musician's Union think I've got a vote in the London Labour, Scottish branch office election. Who to vote for? Hmm. Jim?
Just given up trying to watch @ScotlandTonight from London (UK) tonight. Absolutely appalling streaming service.
Congrats to Young Fathers for their Mercury Music prize. Deserved.
Hallelujah! Praise the Blairite Lord. He stands.   Thank goodness for that. http://t.co/EsM90R3TyT
Lords wondering why there's no SNP members in the HofL. Maybe because it's an absurd, ridiculous institution that is an affront to democracy
Labour seem to be saying it's OK for Scotland to be taken out of Europe against its will. Sure that's going to play out well for them.....
Unelected Lords now debating devolution and Scotland. Don't watch if you're easily enraged.
This is how surreal it gets - a Church of England Bishop in the unelected House of Lords tells Scotland what is good for us.
On Cameron's response to Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its will. http://t.co/5HpwlchhSe
Lots of huddles of London Labour Scottish MPs today. Muttering darkly... Must be something illing them.....
Maybe the silly @CommonsScotAffs can do a report on 'The Influence of Blairism on the Scottish Branch of the London Labour Party'?
The vow doesn't actually exist. It was only the front page of a newspaper. http://t.co/aY9byzHf13
Deliver us from EVEL. Next up is Barnett. http://t.co/MLXyVUY98j
Surely even Labour would agree that Scotland shouldn't be dragged out of Europe against its will?
Unelected Lords to debate devolution. Scotland awaits the considered opinions of donors, cronies and placemen. http://t.co/GUiQ6LhHdf
Fantastic from Nicola Sturgeon. If we're a 'family of nations' then the UK can only quit the EU if all parts of that 'family' agree to.
Deliver us from EVEL. New on my blog. http://t.co/MLXyVUY98j
@Leasky @moh_kohn Maybe, but the digital business models are almost mad. Journalism has stood aside in the IP agenda and gives it work away.
@Leasky @moh_kohn At least the music industry has started to come to terms with digitisation and the new IP agenda - unlike journalism
This is where this poisonous debate about 'immigration' takes you. #yourUK http://t.co/dOIqr4STz4
Surely, if it's true (as some of London Lab say) that Johann was to get sacked from London then all must be in place for Murphy's succession
Phoned Morning Call to try and get @dannyalexander. He refuses to debate the A9 with an oiky nat like me. Thought I'd get a chance on air
The overwhelming majority of your London Labour Scottish MPs (who bothered to vote) voted against real recall last night.
I just want to wish my good friend Jim all the best. I'm sure he'll make an excellent Scottish Labour leadership candidate. #foff
The Westminster establishment beat real recall of MPs 340 to 166.
All SNP MPs will vote for meaningful recall of MPs tonight.
With rejecting meaningful recall the HofC will only give the people of the UK another reason to feel alienated from the Westminster elite
The London Labour Holyrood dream team (designated branch office) Murphy and Anas.
If it is to be Jim, there is no way he can stand as an MP next May. He'll have to take his chances in 2016.
There's only one Jim Murphy, one Jim Murphy, wuunne Jim Murpheeee, there's only... etc, repeat.
Just reached 10k followers. Love you all, except the ones I don't.
Labour are whipped and will vote against a meaningful recall bill. Incredible!
That's that then..... http://t.co/4EvqojaeAv
Lab & Tories both on 31% in latest UK opinion poll. With Scots Lab in meltdown the opportunities for a large SNP group become more obvious.
Anas not standing clears the way for Murphy. That means London Labour MPs as leader and deputy. That'll go down well.....
Maybe London/Scottish Labour can get a vow to say that Gordon Brown will/won't  stand.
Excellent analysis of the London Labour control of Scottish Labour from Lesley Riddoch. http://t.co/JTjKcm8egk
The way that Scottish Labour run internal elections would almost be quaint if it wasn't so patently ridiculous.
Scottish Labour is trending, but not for good reasons, for them anyway.....
Hey, I'm in the Musician's Union. Do I get a vote for the Scottish Labour leadership? I'll chose wisely.....
Fantastic and packed Perthshire North constituency meeting today. I wouldn't fancy being the local Tories in facing this lot.....
Love all this 'Labour family' stuff. Must be about the most disfunctional anti-social 'family' in the neighbourhood
@GeorgeFoulkes @BBCScotlandNews Sort of got a feeling you're going to be in much demand with your list of MSPs against Johann.
The battle between the barking John Macternan and the sensible Andy Kerr on crossfire is classic. Has to be put up soon.
John Macternan for Scottish Labour leader. You know it makes sense.....
One well deserved award. http://t.co/5H7O73tU2L
The Sunday papers aren't exactly kind to 'Scottish' Labour this morning.
Boo! Ungracious loser congratulates @AngusMacNeilMP on his 10k followers. He's still well below me in most influential Scots tweeter list
@ChiefofCarnock @AngusMacNeilMP I've just done my thing by unfollowing him. Come on Scotland.
You've got to help me beat @AngusMacNeilMP in the race to get 10k followers. Only because it would really p*** him off.
I'll tell you what Scottish Labour needs - a Westminster politician! That'll convince the Scottish people they take Holyrood seriously.
Here my good friend, Jim Murphy, is the front runner for the Labour leadership. Hope he manages to contain his Westminster temper. #foff
Again, there is one paper offering diversity in the most politically engaged nation in Europe. https://t.co/urZcj6RBVP
Combined Tory/UKIP now on 51% with Labour in meltdown. Only one way we can be protected in Scotland. Devo-max with a majority of SNP MPs.
How about a report from the silly @CommonsScotAffs? 'The impact of the referendum on Scottish separation on the Scottish Labour Party'
RIP Jack Bruce. Great guy. I remember seeing him throw a promoter into a hedge when he suggested he should cut his set at a festival.
@mikeweirsnp Of course. No other way.
It's funny how your running objectives and ambitions change over time. I'm now in training for the Perth Santa Run....
I remember when Scots Lab were 'bayoneting the wounded' & talking of 'finishing off' the SNP with a massive No vote. Wonder what went wrong?
One of the Labour 'dinosaurs' should throw their hat in the ring. We need to hear the case why Scottish Labour should be run from London.
Are Labour going to move on to the 'Miliband issue' now? http://t.co/BOgIUIqdRX
You would think that maybe now Scottish Labour MPs will get it, but they won't.
Labour being Labour will only go and elect someone responsible for getting them into this mess in the first place.
I just want to make it absolutely clear that i am not resigning form the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party.
@GeorgeFoulkes @GerryHassan Come on, George. Rise to the occasion. An unelected Lord is what Labour needs in this moment of crisis.
There are so many inconsistencies and ironies to Johanns's resignation statement. Thank goodness we have the Scottish press to scrutinise...
The whole premise of a 'Scottish Labour Party' is in tatters tonight. It could never and will not happen. It's all about their MPs. #johann
Is Anas staying put? The answer to that could be quite revealing.
Scottish Labour's problems are now of the existential variety.
Labour can not replace Johann with a Westminster politician. Would only confirm her view of them pulling the strings.
Johann Lamont's resignation will rank as one of the key moments in the new post indyref Scottish political environment. Incredible!

In a fascinating discussion this morning on how the UK can help democracy in developing world and we still have the absurd unelected Lords.
Launch of Poppy Scotland at the Scotland Office tonight. Great to see MPs from all parties in Scotland there.

Great competition at PMQs today about which is the most rubbish NHS. Labour run Wales or Tory/Dum England.
@unityscots That' s what you think. Au revoir the noo.
Cameron confirms full fiscal autonomy is on the table in response to @AngusMacNeilMP in obvious put down of Ruth Davidson.
I know what the UK needs - more Lords. There must be another party donor or Labour MP that needs moved on out there. #yourUK
All that needs to happen is for Project Fear to reconvene to campaign against devo-max and then we'll be right through the looking glass.
Geez! They've now scaremongering on devo max. Next we'll be too wee, poor & stupid for full fiscal autonomy! What're these unionists like?
@normalnation Would be fascinating to see the business strategy that is leading them to oblivion.
It's almost as if the Scottish press want to do all they can to antagonise a possible potential readership. #plummetingsales
Apparently, according to UKIP, the fact they've embraced a misogynist, far right, holocaust denier is all the fault of a Liberal consensus!
The Aberfeldy Festival next weekend. Fantastic line up as always. http://t.co/crhMhuExmn
To get their Euro cash form an EU they want to leave UKIP team up with a holocaust denying misogynist who even Le Pen finds too extreme.
Westminster MPs can sound really pompous when they're talking about Westminster MPs. #recall
MPs going on about people drifting away from politics. Not in Scotland 85% turn out. Not in the SNP we've trebled our membership. #recall
@Kenny_young @theSNP Certainly not by capping child benefit or voting with the theTories in their general welfare benefit cap.
Hey Scotland, you're getting some more unelected Lords to rule over you. Like we've not got enough! Must be 800 now. http://t.co/JvZjaaZghB
'And they said it was Scottish nationalists that were obsessed with borders'. Fantastic from Ian Macwhirter. http://t.co/574zXOeIaF
The so called 'recall' bill today where Westminster would decide which MPs can be recalled rather than constituents.
According to Margaret Curran everything's OK in Scottish Labour. Phew, I thought they were in trouble for a while there.....
@AndrewM78585493 That is a very good question.
If the Tories are to stop Europeans coming into the UK can the Spanish stop retired Tories moving to Costa Inglaterra?
The English 'heroism' bill has managed to get through the Commons today without any assistance from Scots Labour MPs. #EVEL
Lab have gone from a 35% strategy to a 30% one. Unbelievably, they could still have a majority. Just not a real mandate. With 50% Tory/UKIP
Companies moving out, prices going up, HQs relocating. It's as if the EU bureaucrats have got hold of the Project Fear handbook! #brexit
Maybe Cameron can get a 'vow' from European leaders that he'll get his opt-outs if the UK stays in Europe?
The first comment from the first caller to 'has Scottish Labour lost its way?' Was 'yes, absolutely'.
Morning Call asking 'has Scottish Labour lost its way'? Now, that's a tough one, sure to garner much debate!

Gordon Brewer in overdrive this morning on Sunday Politics. That must have been some breakfast he had! Answering his own questions now.
Spent too long listening to Brown than is good 4 you this week. Great look at this strange man from @AndrewWilsonAJW http://t.co/3HksTtLDWu
Never known Labour to be in such a perilous position. They've got to decide whether to chase UKIP votes or appeal to a Liberal consensus
Lab's biggest problem is their former voters won't forget or forgive them for being in alliance with the Tories then celebrating with them.
At least there's the Sunday Herald. https://t.co/Z6JNXJKQtn
Hey, Scottish press. You're losing readers in the most news hungry politically educated nation in Europe. Maybe try diversity of opinion?
@HolyWhitewater @buzzy_bee Was fantastic Scott, and thanks again for the use of the church.
UK opinion poll with UKIP on 24% and UKIP/Tory on 53%. What have we done Scotland?

The energy and the engagement goes on in Perth. http://t.co/8zwJKfSaW4
Got a note from the movers of the 'Barnett Review' debate for the SNP to add our names. Replying now. Ehm...it's a vow, guarantee & promise!
After (not quite) debating Scotland this week Westminster gets down to its absolute favourite obsession this morning - leaving Europe.
The shameful treatment of Scotland in the HofC this week demonstrates why we need an army of SNP MPs down there.
Hearing there are now over 100 backbench MPs who want to have Barnett reviewed. But hey, it's alright - it's in the vow.
In the 7 or so hours of debate on Scotland this week the SNP got 6 minutes. Gordon Brown got unlimited time and another debate. How it works
What a supreme waste of time that was. The next debate will move on to 'reviewing' the Barnett Formula. Looks like that'll be 2 weeks today.
Off to chair a session of the excellent Westminster Legal Policy Forum on the Unified Patent Court and next steps for IP policy.
@daz1985 @GordonBrown There is absolutely no way that someone as exalted and self important as Brown will give way to me.
Just when you thought it was safe to take out your vows. For 1 night only. Brown II. Brown The sequel. The Brown Strikes Back. 5pm the HofC
Apparently Brown's presenting that petition tonight, That's the petition demanding the Gov't to honour the vow that he made on behalf of
My speech in yesterday's Westminster more powers/devolution debate http://t.co/KbV5SfqbT9
Where the UK broadcasting elite would have the future of the UK debated by 4 men in suits Scotland now has 3 female party leaders.
In the debate yesterday I got 6 mins @JonathanPlaid got 3 mins. Another backbencher, Gordon Brown, got to drone on as long as he wanted
Scots Questions today & there's 5 English Tories with questions. Guess some might see the irony with their obsession with 'English votes'
After having no time limit imposed on him in yesterday's debate there is another episode of Gordon Brown on Thursday. Can we take anymore?
Labour to boycott the Tory 'English votes' commission after being enthusiastic partners in the Tory led 'Better Together' campaign.
The vow. The view of Parliament. The Prime Minister. A massive dereliction of duty. http://t.co/TgC8FmXogY
It has simply been an awful debate today. Scotland has been let down again by the HofC & Scots are right to feel appalled at what they saw.
Fantastic. Apparently I've been trending today. https://t.co/R8XZv8yQeR
The back bencher Gordon Brown has spoken. The time limit goes on. This is how it works. #thevow
Gordon Brown coming close to conceding he was duped about English Votes for English Laws on the vow. #thevow
Incredible! Brown now has the right to take up the rest of today's debate. He has another debate on Thursday. He's a backbencher. #thevow
Where everyone gets 6 minutes to speak. The Lab and Tory frontbenches, Michael Moore and Gordon Brown will have no limits. Unbelievable!
This debate has absolutely nothing to do with Scotland. It is a debate about English Votes for English Laws. #thevow
Hague moved on from Scotland after 14 minutes in his speech. Lab front bencher Sadiq Khan doesn't bother with Scotland at all. #thevow
A reminder that today's 'devolution' debate is on at 12.30. Will the 'vow' be sidelined in an inconsequential UK spat about Scots MPs votes?
Daily Record seem to have this summed up quite well. It is a dereliction of duty for the PM to chicken out. http://t.co/llpUWkPzzy
Fantastic vote to recognise Palestine. 274 to 12. All SNP MPs supported the motion.
All SNP MPs will vote to recognise Palestine tonight.
SNP press release on the Command Paper and tomorrow's debate. http://t.co/0RIUetf2Tv
People asking where they can see the 'further devolution' debate. It's scheduled tomorrow at 12.30 and is on the Parliament channel.
Hope as many Scots as possible watch tomorrow's debate on devolution. They will see Scotland become a mere sideshow in its own debate #EVEL
Said to the Scots Sec he may have his 'command paper' but it is the Scottish people who are in command, and they expect.
Now certain that tomorrow's debate on devolution is going to be almost exclusively on EVEL. Told the Gov Scotland will be appalled at this
Statement on the command paper and the business motion to change tomorrow's debate to a debate about further devolution confirmed.
The SNP to be ignored and sidelined once again in the General Election debates from the broadcasting elites and Westminster establishment.
Looks like there's a statement on the 'Command Paper'. As usual we will be told nothing in advance from the Westminster establishment
Westminster is reducing the vow on 'more powers' to Scotland to nothing more than the usual establishment spat between the UK parties
Where Scots couldn't care less about Scots MPs voting on English only legislation they care passionately about the vow being honoured.
Gordon Brown seems to be more interested in protecting Scots MPs voting rights on English only legislation than the 'vow' he engineered.
@andrew_howie1 Not holding my breath for a speedy or satisfactory response.
In case you missed it my letter to the PM about this week's 'more powers' debate and why he should lead it. http://t.co/GTs8hCupyX
Hearing Hague is to lead the 'Scotland' 'more powers' debate. The man tasked to sort out Scots MPs voting on English stuff #sidelined #again
@dvdwlsh1 @Mae_Carson1 Parliament channel from 12.30 Tuesday if there's no statements in advance
Looks like Labour will join in the emerging UKIPification of the UK. Should be taking on their agenda and assumptions.

As the disconnect between the Scottish press and a news hungry Scottish public goes on we still have the @newsundayherald
@agcolehamilton @Gav_McLellan Let's hope so, but what a huge electoral constituency and influence on any policy choices.
UKIP on 25%. What a UK we have in store for us, Scotland. Let's get as many powers as possible so they have so few to exercise over us.
Huge week for 'the vow' in London this week. Mon - command paper. Tues - more powers debate. Wed - Scots questions. Thurs - Brown's debate
To rub salt into the wounds it's likely that UKIP's first MP will make his 'maiden' speech in Tuesday's 'more powers' debate.
UKIP looking for 25 seats. They now rightly believe that English Labour seats are opening for them. Th UKIPification of the UK goes on.
@scots_wa_hey @MrMalky Yup. I noticed that too. They really don't have a clue.
@hoppinghaggis it's a separate application for a debate. Gov't debate on Tuesday is a general debate.
This is what Tory MPs want to debate It's all about EVEL and Barnett. This is where they are. http://t.co/6TEIaKoSrO
Of the over 70 members calling for Barnett to be reviewed none are Scots and all but 4 are Tories.
The motion from 70 MPs calling for Barnett to be reviewed also calls for public consultation about devolution across all parts of the union
One of those 'best of both worlds' could soon be partly run by europhobic, immigrant loathing Daily Mail readers.
My letter to the PM. You must lead the debate on 'more powers' but you must leave your backbenchers at home. #EVEL http://t.co/GTs8hCupyX
The UKIPification of the UK will be complete if they do indeed hold the balance of power next year. #yourUK
It is now obvious why Barnett is in the 'vow' but not in the Parliamentary motion. The Gov't won't get Barnett past their backbench.
The scary thing is most MPs who want to 'review' the Barnett formula are form the governing Tory party.
Just seen an application for a debate calling for 'a review of the Barnett formula' signed by over 70 MPs. We get even further from the vow.
My letter to the PM on why he should lead the more powers debate and why he should leave his Tory backbechers at home http://t.co/GTs8hCupyX
The test for the UK parties is if they continue to pander to UKIP or finally stand up to them?
Work as if you live in the early days of a UKIP nation. #yourUK
Dear Dave, about this debate and all this 'EVEL' business. My letter to the PM. New on my blog. http://t.co/NbEJwZbhl0
Don't think I know anyone in Clacton or Heywood but anyone out there please don't vote UKIP. Us Scots still have to share the UK with you.
SNP 43%. Lab 29%. The (awfully) silent majority Tories 17%. Yougov. Scotland. General Election.
Are the Liberals finally heading home? Hallelujah! Now pay your bills.
@Deerd08 I am very concerned about the ongoing UKIPification of the UK. They already pull all this Govt's strings. Come to office to discuss
@Deerd08 I'm despairing this is about to pass. We all have to challenge UKIP's pernicious agenda. I hope that the UK (wide) parties will too
@Deerd08 Nothing we can do about it now. Just hope that the UK parties start to stand up to them and don't continue to pander to them.
@Deerd08 UKIP are the antithesis of my political values and it fills me with horror that they will have Parliamentary representation.
Spent the last three nights talking to new members in rural Perthshire SNP branches. We now have a committed army for change. Everywhere.
The UKIPification of the UK picks up pace tomorrow with the election of the 1st UKIP MP. Wait to see the next Gov't Scotland didn't vote for
Labour now call for the resignation of the sub-treasurer of Auchinshoogle branch SNP. The only SNP member they haven't asked to resign.
Geez! The Lib Dems are STILL there... More people attending SNP branch meeting than attending their conference.
Today, I'm calling for the Scottish Labour Party to resign for 'failing to provide effective opposition'. Surely must carry the House?
A hilarious response from the 'capacious' brain of Blair's former spin doctor, John Macternan. http://t.co/s3o9kZqPVT
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP I return to my original point I will only vote for issues that affect my constituents.
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP It would have to be agreed or it simply wouldn't work.
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP It wouldn't. English only would be determined by a fair means of 'certification'. Privatisation would be included
@keithalexander @DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP Yup. If it has a significant impact on our constituents. It is they we serve.
Has the 'party of all the talents' the Scottish Labour Party now asked for everyone in the SNP to resign?
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP Yup, it most certainly does. That isn't an English only issue. We similarly voted on tuition fees.
@cllrdmeikle You would think that at least 1 Scottish journalist would think so......
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP No they're not. And I won't waste their time in taking an interest in issues decided by another Parliament.
@DaveSTUC @DavidMundellMP My duty is to represent my constituents. Beginning  of and all.
EVEL works both ways. We don't vote on English only legislation and they leave Scottish Questions and Scottish legislation alone.
Will @DavidMundellMP vow to stop voting on English only legislation if he believes, like his party, in EVEL?
There's 5 Tories down for a question in Scots Questions. Will they now withdraw if they believe in being consistent in Eng Votes 4 Eng Laws?
Spending the week at Perthshire SNP branches speaking to new members. The UK parties should be very worried. They're dynamic & committed.
@VoteYesSept Can only be changed with agreement from the House in a business motion. A formality on Monday when we return.
We're going to have a debate but it must be led by the PM & to be consistent on EVEL rest of Tories should stay away http://t.co/gRW3H9FfDN
Labour's last desperate pitch 'vote for us, we're not the Tories'. Somehow that won't wash in Scotland anymore.
Geez! Yet another day of Liberal miserablism. Does it ever end? #theyarethe7percent
Labour at a Yougov 4 year low on 33%. Meanwhile Tory/UKIP on 48%. What a wonderful UK we're staying in.

@burdynumnum A debate on  a 'national pollination strategy' and a report from 'the all party cycling group'.

@jikdmmen All day Thursday the 16th.
Gordon Brown will only be another time limited back-bench MP trying to catch the Speakers eye in the 'more powers' debate. Where we're at.
After our pressure W'ster is now going to have a full debate on 'more powers' and Gordon Brown won't be leading it. It's now out his hands.
Last week at Westminster Labour MPs were asking - do you think the Yes vote we lost will come back to us? Ehm, No colleagues, I don't.

@dtaylor5633 @38_degrees If this is true can 38 degrees make a statement to disassociate themselves from Brown's attempt to save his vow?
Where we would expect the Tories to support the poll tax and pursue the poor we should at least expect some sort of response from Labour.
What google should have paid in tax would pay for Scotland's poll tax arrears from Scotland's poorest 8 times over. #thetories
The Tories still defending the hated poll tax is perhaps the most revealing issue of the day. Same old Tories.
@38_degrees Did you have an arrangement with Gordon brown on this petition? This is immensely important for Scotland.
Tories now ahead in the UK opinion polls. If Labour are going to ditch the useless Miliband it will have to be now.

@hammerqos BBC Iplayer. It's fantastic.
Watching the Frankie Boyle post referendum show. Hadn't seen the clip of Jacob Rees-Mogg in Glasgow. Hilarious.
@KennyFarq Aah! That's alright then.
@KennyFarq So, I'm a troll, Kenny? That the official Scotsman view?
Wow! We're at 34% and ahead for Westminster. http://t.co/0uD1LNo3gY
At Sandalwood shoe shop to promote #PerthLoveFest. Great initiative to take pride in our fantastic city. http://t.co/bZsIJUmVpz
@VeloMonster Yeah, Labour were experts at opposing the poll tax in Scotland by ensuring that it was so effectively administered.
So pleased that the FM has ruled out pursuing historic poll tax arrears. Labour are obviously right behind this? Right?
So sad to hear of the death of Lynsey De Paul. Got to know her through her work with PRS. Great songwriter and champion of musician rights.
The Enchanted Forest was just fantastic. Delighted to have been asked to open this year's event. http://t.co/IFJOysQt9u
My letter to the Speaker on Gordon Brown's pathetic and puny debate on 'the vow'. Scotland deserves better than this. http://t.co/UiLCXJXgb6
My letter to the Speaker on that woeful Gordon Brown debate on 'the vow'. http://t.co/UiLCXJXgb6
I'm opening the Enchanted Forest in Faskally tonight. Scotland's biggest outdoor autumn attraction. http://t.co/1bF1aW0EWP
I think Brown also wants to enlist your support so that Scots MPs can continue to vote on English only laws. Their priority, apparently.
Yesterday - the vow. Today - the petition. Tomorrow - a letter to Santa.
On any media round table bids I will ask if it is exclusively male. If it is I will refuse to go on.
@Daily_Record Please tell me you are not serious...?!
Where has Scottish Labour gone? They must be out there somewhere?
BBC reporting Tories asking Scots MPs not to vote on English laws is a trap! Who cares. We're being asked to sign a petition 4 what's agreed
Today will go down as a big moment in the post indyref realignment. Not sure if the Scots press are up 2 the task of adequately reporting it
@robj4847 Will do.
Tomorrow I will write to the Speaker demanding a real debate on 'the vow'. Brown's debate is simply an embarrassment.
Does anybody but Scottish Labour care less if Scottish MPs vote on English only legislation? We already don't in the SNP.
Brown's October Westminster 'debate' is an unvotable, unamendable half hour adjournment debate. That's it.
When is a vow not a vow? When it becomes a petition, apparently.
Tory preconditions. Brown's petition. Has anybody got a clue what's going on in the 'more powers' devo-max world?
Dear 16 and 17 year olds - you'll have had your vote. This is Westminster. http://t.co/GkF7su5HjP
Maybe we should get a 100,000 strong petition to demand that Gordon Brown delivers the promises he made on behalf of the Tory Government?
So, it's not devo-max we're getting then? Is that what the Government are now saying? It's certainly all unravelling at pace now.
Why does Gordon Brown need a 100,000 petition to get the 'more powers' he promised on behalf of the Government he's now petitioning?
The Tories trying to increasingly suggest that a No vote is a Tory vote. Have Labour just been the Tories useful idiots?
The idea of Boris being amusing must be a sort of right wing buffoonery thing.
Not sure Lab shouting 'more Tory than the Tories' at UKIP is going to work given they're just slightly less Tory than the Tories themselves
There's @GemmaWDMP putting a cogent and articulate case for Labour's support for the UK Govt's war. Said absolutely no-one listening to her.
I'm apparently the number 1 target seat for the Tories (once again). Last time I secured that honour I trebled my majority.
Hi @DavidMundellMP with your parties obsession on EVEL will you now vow to no longer vote on English measures? No more Tory MPs in Scots Qs?
More and more Tories droning on about English votes for English laws. So why does the 1 Scots Tory MP still vote on English only measures?
I love Catalonia & am inspired in their attempt 2 create a better nation in the face of such hostility. Now I can say it. Go 4 it my friends
@AlanRoden @C_KAndrews @David_Cameron Yes got about 43%. I trebled my majority over the Tories on 39%.
@C_KAndrews @David_Cameron @thecourieruk Always confident but particularly enjoy all these Tory predictions (once again).
@C_KAndrews @David_Cameron @thecourieruk Yeah, they say that every election. Last time I trebled my majority over them.
@blindmanonhorse Let me go through my pockets.... Ehm, no.
@Gerry31D @zer0deConduit If it's so important they can lead by example? We don't vote on English measures.
@NealHockley Seriously!? *shocked sarcastic face*
@Gerry31D @zer0deConduit Yup, but the Tories are now saying how awful all this is but still do it themselves.
The one Scottish Tory MP has voted on nearly all English only legislation.
I don't vote on English legislation bit will Tories now vow not to ask Scottish Questions and vote on Scottish constitutional legislation?
Labour sniffing round and poking at the Tories big welfare benefit trap before obligingly walking right into it. #uselesslabour
The Tories to cut the Welfare cap (which Lab supported[) and working age benefits. Over to you Labour......
In case you missed it. We might not be having a leadership contest but we need a full debate http://t.co/GgOjJArsv7
There is something particularly uncomfortable about this image. No more please, Tories.  http://t.co/H9WwzBzaV4
This was all over Perth today for the Ryder Cup. Couldn't help thinking - Elvis Costello that way. http://t.co/ozRn4n782T
@gogshunter @ergo999 @strathearnrose We'll just see if we can muddle through.
Standing room only at the Perth and Kinross Yes meeting.  Incredible atmosphere and we go on. http://t.co/QUGVxe7lb3
William Hague seems to be re-inventing the 'more powers' and Barnett offers once again.
We won't be having a leadership contest in the SNP but we must still have the debate. http://t.co/GgOjJArsv7
Big news from the Tory conference. There will also be no MP4 gig.
For no apparent reason. http://t.co/lQ8iGDv3ML
@SimonPia1 I'm sure that made some sort of sense when you were constructing that in your head, but you've now lost me. #globcapital
@SimonPia1 Fascinating, and totally illustrative to the fact that you have no idea about what has happened, and is still going on.
Over a thousand visits already. The next steps for our movement. http://t.co/GgOjJArsv7
@SimonPia1 Are you seriously going to continue to call your former voters names and characterise as something they barely recognise?
@SimonPia1 Well, bless Her Maj.....
@SimonPia1 Great, knock yourself out! Sure 'former' Labour voters will really appreciate the continued name calling. Fantastic 'crusade'.
@SimonPia1 Yeah, and the continued use of the word 'separatist' is really helping you reconnect with all those lost Labour voters.
After the indyref Scotland is in the hands of the most turbulent and unpredictable range of electoral conditions ever assembled in the rUK.
My soundtrack to indy ref will be King Creosote's From Scotland with love. Played it to wind down & he was a unionist http://t.co/xxWfdghF9T
There's only one Sunday newspaper worth buying tomorrow. The one that offers a snippet of plurality to our national debate. @newsundayherald
We won't be having a leadership contest but we should still have a debate. Some thoughts on the next steps. My blog. http://t.co/GgOjJArsv7
It doesn't get much truer than this. Labour in Scotland from Kevin McKenna. http://t.co/yPXi22grHT
The new series of Dr Who is rubbish. Peter Capaldi can't save these poor plots.
All the UK party conferences seem to be going really well.......
They're giving out EU guides & performing Ode to Joy in Perthshire for the Ryder Cup. UKIP better get up quickly to turn their backs on this
Already all the talk is of ground troops in Iraq. Exactly what we warned against yesterday.
Mark Reckless sounds a little bit like John Major on helium.
Work as if you live in the early days of a UKIP nation. I did try to warn of this. #UKIPUK
Another UKIP defection from another Tory MP. Scotland was told not to worry about the rise of UKIP. They will get nothing they said.
Can hardly get down Perth High Street without tripping over new SNP members.
@miriamruthross @davemorgan76 Yup. 2 for 'Aye' 2 for No. It's still a head count in the Commons. Usually done by whips.
@Herald_Editor From Scottish Labour MPs?
Lots of Tory MPs saying 'glad to have you back and that you're staying with us' today. Some of them might even have meant it.
524- 43 for motion for military action in Iraq. No exit strategy and danger of mission creep will mean we will return to this soon.
I voted against the Iraq war and I will be voting against military action in Iraq this evening.
Great speech by @MorayMP. We will not be supporting the motion tonight. #IraqDebate
Made tribute to David Haines in Commons debate. To the people of Perth he is simply a hero.
Hope someone is going to get round to asking @RoryStewartUK about his cairn. 'It was the stanes wot won it'. #bbcqt
If Emily Thornberry is the voice of Labour post referendum god help them. #bbcqt
That Tory 1992 committee in full. What about these more powers for Scotland? Stuff that. What about the West Lothian Question? More like it.
Remember that stuff about Tory MPs rushing to reward Scotland with more powers if they vote No? Their real agenda. http://t.co/EQjQ1JMAiM
We might not be having a leadership contest but we should still have the debate about the future and direction of the party.
Can't believe that Douglas (the anti Midas touch) Alexander is still in charge of Labour's UK election campaign.
Last plug for my blog. We may have lost but we don't feel defeated or diminished. http://t.co/HsVi4KX4FB
Perth has gone Ryder Cup mad. Great atmosphere and excitement in the Fair City.
Apparently, according to the LTA Andy Murray is entitled to an opinion. What next? Celebrities love bombing us with their opinions?
'Labour having a fantastic conference'. 'Ed's speech well received and hits all the right buttons'. Said no commentator this morning
Is citizen journalism grown & developed through the indyref now replacing the MSM as the main means of reporting public life in Scotland?
Thousands of people have read my latest blog on where we are now in this post referendum situation. It's here. http://t.co/TWWMtvT4Zq
In other news. Got round to listening to the new Alt-J album and it truly is a thing of hard to pin down dialectic beauty.
The UKIP use of the word 'foreigner' to assist them in the indyref is the thing that I'll find hardest to forgive the Labour Party for.
@DAaronovitch That is a very good question, David.
Even though we didn't win the referendum we don't feel defeated or diminished. On my blog. http://t.co/HsVi4KX4FB
They're now doing highlights of Ed's speech on BBC2 Scotland. Going to have to pad it out a bit....
Moving on. New on my blog. http://t.co/HsVi4KX4FB
Looks like Westminster is going to be recalled on Friday to discuss Syria/Iraq.
@MalcolmChishol1 @strathearnrose @UKLabour @Blake3987 Phew! That's alright then.....
The big news from the Labour Party conference is that there is no MP4 gig this year.
A good starting point for the Labour 'crusade' is to stop referring to those they wish to speak to as 'separatists'.
@stateofthecity But the views of the Canadian 'urbanist conservatives' was given high priority, apparently.
Hearing that there already plans to lock out SNP MPs from any debate about 'more powers' at Westminster. Arithmetic, apparently.
@UKLabour @Blake3987 I thought there was no privatisation in the NHS? Wasn't that what you were telling Scotland last week?
@martinmccluskey So what did they say then? I thought I heard that only Westminster (currently the Tories) could only save our NHS?
Labour today - 'you can never trust the Tories with the NHS'. Labour last week - 'the NHS is safe with the Tories'.
Hear that the @CommonsScotAffs is to do an inquiry on 'the effect of the referendum on Scottish separation on Labour MPs constituencies'.
So all that talk of post referendum rancour resulted in people leaving donations for food banks. What a wonderful country this is.
Has there ever been a more joyless bunch than our friends in the Scottish Labour leadership? You would think they lost the referendum.
The promise to protect Barnett made in 'the vow' isn't in their Westminster motion. Why? http://t.co/Gsxl65YH2v
Is everybody enjoying the Labour Party conference? Riveting, isn't it?
Looking at my referendum diary can't believe it now sits at 160,000 words with an entry for every day since July last year.
Meanwhile at that Tory 'summit'. What about these 'more powers' then? Stop the Scots voting on English legislation? Agreed? Agreed. Next....
Just a fantastic piece from Kevin McKenna. How to console a Yes daughter. http://t.co/Qe9c1iCxMl
As they say in the more refined parts of Edinburgh. You'll have had your devo-max?
@stateofthecity But it is it a reasonable policy question to be challenged on his CV in lieu of an answer?
@misterhsk It is so totally YOU.....
@stateofthecity Ahh.... Thought it might have been something like that.
@stateofthecity What's an 'urbanist Conservative'? Think we might have a couple on the Glasgow Road.
Let's be absolutely clear. The 'timetable' is simply not possible with Tory backbench revolt, UK party rows and the unelected House of Lords
The way that the Yes campaign has responded to the indyref result is the untold story of the last few days. What a wonderful group of people
I'd like to be a fly on the wall at the 1st meeting of the Tory 1922 committee when they meet to discuss more powers for Scotland.....
@LouiseMensch @derekbmcneil @ScotTories Louise, you're in New York! With due respect you're not exactly all over this....
@jimmyja29795206 Yup Jimmy. Expect that membership will be up for the Greens too.
SNP at almost 50% in the polls. Membership through the roof. A new engaged Scotland is certainly not through with this democracy stuff.
SNP MPs don't vote on English only issues. It's not about the constitution, it's about fairness and representing our constituents.
Labour's main problem is that they will have to try and win back the lost 45 in Scotland whilst appealing to UKIP voters in England.
First day off for ages. Anstruther. Fish and chips and King Creosote. http://t.co/6ogXsg3gNX
@GavinBarwellMP You'd have to ask your Lord Ashcroft for that. It was he who provided the data.
Westminster must be recalled this week for a statement on the 'more powers' timetable.
Just incredible the numbers joining the SNP in the last 24 hours.
Thr most impressive thing about the last 24 hours is the way that the energy harnessed and created by 'the 45' refuses to go away.
In less than 12 hours since the result was announced 'more powers' has become about what England will secure as all the UK parties fall out
Go on, Johann, Try to be generous.
Alex recruited me to the SNP. I worked as his whip at W'ster. Unparalleled, without peer, a giant, a mentor, a legend. Gutted.
No, no, no! Alex resigns as party leader.
Incredible. There were majorities for Yes in every age band from 25 to 54 and also 16-17. We couldn't reach the over 65s. 73% for NO.
Still hurts this morning but immensely proud of the 1.6 million strong new progressive movement for change that was created in Scotland .
In defeat the First Minister stands even taller. Let's hope the Prime Minister equals this in victory.
My job now as a Westminster MP is to ensure that whatever those promised 'more powers' are they are now delivered.
Obviously disappointed but congratulate the No campaign and will work with them and my fellow Scots to make my nation a better place.
@strathearnrose testing, testing......
Perth and Kinross turn out 86.9%.
@thekingbeastie Making no predictions.
Quite an extraordinary day in Perthshire. Some incredible turn outs. Now squeezing the lass sinew of Yesness out of Perth.
Particularly thrilled for all those 16 and17 year olds voting for the first time in this country. They will do our nation proud.
In just a few hours time for the first time in over 300 years we have the future of Scotland in our hands. Let's vote to keep it there.
What an absolutely incredible evening in Perth. It's now up to us. http://t.co/AJvBpmDDld
@OriginalAliB I'm afraid they're all away. Sold out quicker than Runrig at Loch Lomond.
Really pleased Perth has been chosen for the First Minister's last message before the polls open. Going to be some night in the fair city.
The Tories must be furious with Lab for letting their No vote slip. The Tories - The true No believers. They get the govt we didn't vote for
The view from Perth. The Canadian version. http://t.co/gU3TZF4YyV
Going to try and get round all of my massive constituency today with a car (obviously) a loud speaker, passion and some cool tunes.
More powers? This is the reality of Westminster. It's Barnett and the WLQ. http://t.co/nxEUsrdykb
You've got to love the 'lone panda' David Mundell. The Tories are 'in fact' popular in Scotland! Fantastic. #notnewsnicht
Hey, some of my No trolls are back. Almost missed them. How we doing boys?
@JamesDo24914230 @FatherCrowe @RFC477 Would go to the ditch for press freedom but surely we also deserve press 'diversity' too?
The only issue we have had in peaceful Perthshire is when some No zoomer tried to lunge at me and Dougie on Saturday in the High Street.
Alt-J on Later (before newsnight). You almost forget that there's other world going on beyond the indyref. Just fantastic.
Does anyone know how these opinion poll 'panels' process the 100s of 1,000s who have been disengaged but have recently registered?
Thank goodness for on-line. At least an editorial for Yes can be made there. This would not have been possible 10 years ago.
It now looks likely that none of the daily Scottish press will support Yes, Welcome to press diversity in Scotland. We have been let down.
Not taking note of any poll tonight. At best it's just an unrepresentative snapshot with so many variants kicking around in the indyref
Why is 'Mr Dimbleby' not asking 'Mr Brown' why he cut corporation tax?
But, but... Mr Dimbleby. #broon
Apparently, I've also got the record for the number of F-offs brandished at someone by Jim Murphy in the House of Commons too.
I also got the use of the word 'separation' banned in Commons questions and debate titles. #littlevictories
Apparently, I hold the record for mentioning independence in the House of Commons. http://t.co/UdDpYKwyga
Have to say that I've never come across a Tory backbencher that wants to reward Scotland for NO. Have heard lots about Barnett & WLQ though

@ScotsBok @DGLabour That the Keir  Hardie who was born in Scotland , represented a Welsh and English constituency & opposed independence

@Southsidegrrrl @AngusMacNeilMP @alpha_beatt @YesScotland As Angus says- dont ask me ask author of "u can have solidarity with sharing a PM"
@AngusMacNeilMP @alpha_beatt @YesScotland I'll let DG residents know SNP say their links with Cumbria are same as their links to Cambodia
@AngusMacNeilMP @alpha_beatt @YesScotland Last time I checked Cambodia , Cork or Cologne didn't share a PM with the UK
I'm fundraising for @macmillancancer on @JustGiving. Please #sponsorme & RT http://t.co/gjOEDSRgXR
@alpha_beatt @AngusMacNeilMP @YesScotland don't agree UK voters will.  But that's another good reason to get rid of UK Tory Gov in May .
@alpha_beatt @AngusMacNeilMP @YesScotland I care just as much about someone unemployed in Cumbria as I do Caithness. It's called solidarity
@alpha_beatt @AngusMacNeilMP @YesScotland Turning our back on working families across the UK is a stance we would rightly be hammered on
@alpha_beatt @AngusMacNeilMP @YesScotland fortunately most people are mature even to make a decision based on their own believes not others
@AngusMacNeilMP or will you grow up and stop labelling every Scot who doesn't agree with @yesscotland an austerity loving rabid Tory?
@AngusMacNeilMP shall I list all the policies of @yescotland chums Greens, SSP, Sillars - and you can say which you support?
@AngusMacNeilMP do you support 50p top rate of tax and oppose massive cut in corporation tax- I do- do you- yes or no?
@AngusMacNeilMP I voted against it - just like I support 50p top tax rate & oppose massive cut in corporation tax - unlike you & the Tories
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon so why can't you name them?
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon No just the Labour supporting ones
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon Feel free to list them
@tigerhouse87 I'm sure you are a lifelong Labour voter
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon I've spent all of my 50 plus years in Scotland thanks. Care to list current Labour backing newspapers.......
@_amymcf but knows he has no power to have it.
@tigerhouse87 An answer from whom!
@_amymcf And all 3 are worse than using the £ in a currency union.
@TheHappyTroll Using the pound without a currency union is like dirivng a car with no insurance. It's dangerous and stupid-"The Panama Plan"
@tigerhouse87 Certainly wasn't what Alex Salmond said.......
@_amymcf But which option is Alex Salmond's preferred alternative or are we seriously saying vote yes - then we'll think about the currency
@ewandmunro So which one is the preferred alternative option- surely Alex Salmond has a preference?
@tigerhouse87 But which is the preferred second option? Will we have our own currency or the euro?
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon I must have missed that long line of Labour supporting newspapers......
@tigerhouse87 So what is the preferred alternative option to a currency union?
@TheHappyTroll So what is the preferred alternative option to a currency union?
@MartinMcD1980 @paulhutcheon Suspect some of the decent Journos at Sunday Herald are hurting after seeing their paper handed to SNP to write
So another debate but still no answers on currency, pensions and public spending funding #bbcindyref #nothanks
@AngusMacNeilMP bit quick to distance yourself from your boss- wagons circling?
8000 defence jobs is a "'burden" according to Salmond which maybe explains why he is so keen to get rid of them #bbcindyref #nothanks
New debate Plan B from Salmond. Shout lots and lots hope no one sees you haven't answered the question #bbcindyref #nothanks
@paulhutcheon maybe it's full of Sunday Herald journalists?
Presume Alex Salmond doesn't know what powers the Scottish Parliament ALREADY has to create jobs as he never uses them #bbcindyref
Crickey @alexsalmond must agree with all the polices of the Greens, SSP, and even Jim Sillars . What a vision for an independenct Scotland
@briankellacher @newsundayherald You could use the dollar if you want. The issue is currency union. Wha'ts the plan b if there is no union?
@rhr63 Does SNP agree with all the policies of their @yescotland partners . Greens? SSP? Jim Sillars!
@rhr63 Only party in bed with Tories in Dumfries and Galloway was SNP running the council....
@AngusMacNeilMP crickey do you support all the policies in your 'yes team'? Greens, SSP, Jim Sillars!?
@newsundayherald Yes activists hostile....noooooooo!
@newsundayherald That your front page revelation this week?
@alpha_beatt @AlexSalmond You can use the dollar if you want. However, the issue is currency union. What is the plan b if there no union?
Still no Plan B on currency from @AlexSalmond #bbcindyref #nothanks

@scotsecpcs @BBCScotlandNews Slightly contradicted by decision to only comment on DWP but not Scottish Governmemt antics
@DaveMBall @BBCScotlandNews @scotsecpcs must be why the forestry commission "civil servant" is pursuing the Scottish Governments objectives
@DaveMBall @BBCScotlandNews @scotsecpcs No where does it say that in DWP one . Both are wrong .
@BBCScot2014 wonder why you didn't "discuss" this on your programme weeks ago #Scotland2014 http://t.co/Fpx5Kjsoph
@DaveMBall @BBCScotlandNews @scotsecpcs And in the other the civil servant IS supporting the Government's stance.
@MekQuarrie @BBCScotlandNews @scotsecpcs Clearly different?!
@DaveMBall @BBCScotlandNews @scotsecpcs Explain the difference between the two apart from fact only one is on BBC website
Great to join one of the @DGLabour #LabourNo teams on #labourdoorstep in #dumfries tonight http://t.co/NoLDjoAZdG

@fudgiemagoo I am sure you will make up your own mind based on the actual evidence .
@fudgiemagoo Many people in my party opposed the war in Iraq. It's our party not only those who agreed with the action.
@rhr63 no investment from the biggest proponents of independence @scotgov who downgraded Waterfront project when they were elected in 2007.
@fudgiemagoo No need to imply people who support the UK are somehow in favour of wars. My views on Iraq are a matter of public record.
@burdzeyeview you were watching the wrong channel! There are 2 ITV Borders now-  Cumbria one and South of Scotland one - both on freeview.
@fudgiemagoo I admire your ability to predict the views of all future Government's in Scotland.
Tonight was the night @AlexSalmond  confirmed he has no plan B on the currency http://t.co/paJLpF3FiC
@fudgiemagoo I'm sorry but sadly there will still be wars whatever the result in September
Alistair Darling won debate tonight because he highlighted we have the best of both world and Salmond has no Plan B #DarlingWin #ScotDecides
@debamphetamine @AlexSalmond I think the child like performance belongs to Mr Salmond's cross examination.
Thought the press said @AlexSalmond would be sober for debate ? Is he serious with these questions #ScotDecides #indyref
That's answered then. There is no Plan B. @TogetherDarling pummels @AlexSalmond on currency. Time for persona attackes from @AlexSalmond
@eliz_lloyd @theSNP @AlexSalmond Currency union isn't his decision is it?
What is plan B @alexsalmond ? Scotland deserves an answer #ScotDecides #indyref
@KennyFarq @alexsalmond secret referendum plan . Get 45% of vote and declare a majority #ScotDecises #indyref
@KennyFarq He'll luv that comparison! Hard facts is key in referendum. Salmond wants to be el presidente but not presidential election.
@burdzeyeview Eh ?
@burdzeyeview My point. No comment on Bannockburn Natfest. No PR stunts in DG only dignified respect -  unlike your contribution
@petermacmahon @AlexSalmond @TogetherDarling I'll take that "boost" - a substantial No Thanks vote!
@burdzeyeview can't recall your comments about indyfest "Bannockburn Live". Sometimes silence is the best response and way to pay respect...
@KieraanRae I remained unconvinced of wisdom of both UK AND Scottish Gov "leaflets" but neither is same as Gov agencies actively lobbying
Maybe @fcscotland should focus on their job rather than promoting "benefits" of independence at taxpayers expense. http://t.co/oxKmRqdIcE
@burdzeyeview A suitably sanctimonious tweet for the occasion.... Wonder how many Bannockburn veterans there are........

@traquir SNP now against high speed rail? And independence will stop it happening in England. What page in the white paper is that ...
@andalg1 Some people are as concerned about unemployment in Carlisle as Caithness - and want to something about both #itscalledsocialism
@andalg1 I'm pushing for the right decisions to be made on those issues. Not obsessed by where their made
@andalg1 I'm very positive about what we can achieve & what we have achieved. Negatively is the claim it can't be done without independence
@andalg1 the real negativity is the Yescotland claims nothing positive has ever happens in UK - NHS, real influence in world, Minimum Wage..
@walkersworld http://t.co/yrcwe3BvrC when we first raised it and our consultation submission http://t.co/Tbko8JmqFu
@walkersworld I certainly was out campaigning against it and lobbied Ministers and SCR. Local Labour MSPs voted against it but sadly not SNP
@andalg1 I do worry you think a vision can be included in a 140 character tweet when SNP wish list failed in 170,000 words and 649 pages

@KennyFarq there was me thinking that in the interests of working together for local people I shared an office with MSP for Dumfriesshire
@KennyFarq Labour Party properties don't own the local party office in Dumfries so pay the "rent" as article puts it , to the landlady
@KennyFarq You mean you didn't check?
@KennyFarq Shame the facts weren't checked before false claim that sums were "contributed" to a party.
@andalg1 We need a Labour Government to abolish it. Bizarre to say Labour powerless then criticise paired MPs who presumably were to
@andalg1 you distort my point. Lots of comment about pairing, which happens at every vote but no comment about  unfairness of bedroom tax .
@JoanMcAlpine @KevinMcKennaSez You mean happy to credit those you pretend helped but who have no say and mislead people over the facts
@andalg1 Sadly the obsession about who was and wasn't there detracts from the real issue and walks straight into the governments.
@andalg1 The pairing system was in operation which means there is no effect on the majority. Sadly the majority would have been the same
@Cirein_Croin I must have imagined he speech I made during the debate then #snplies
@JoanMcAlpine @KevinMcKennaSez I'm not interested in acknowledgement only that the facts are reported and that wasn't the case here #shoddy
@Cailean_Mac @jitjindar The case was resolved within the rules . I deal as best i can with all cases raised with me as MP.
@JoanMcAlpine but failed to admit what had nothing to do with resolving the matter ie photo ops and Mike Russell's ego

I'm backing the #saveyourpint campaign and meeting with CAMRA during their lobby of Parliament today.
Both UK and Scot Gov ignoring that unemployment is UP today in D&G. Youth unemployment in region at 8.5% compared to UK average of 7.0%.
Really enjoyed presenting the winners of my Christmas card competition with their prizes at the weekend. Congrats to everyone who took part!
Good to see the postmen and women at Dumfries and Castle Douglas sorting offices today. Come wind, rain, freezing temps or snow they're out!
Yesterday's Autumn Statement showed why the Tories need to change course. They have no plans for jobs and getting growth in the economy.
Good to see another busy #dghour and glad BBC ran story about it today.
Nurses and midwives in D&G cut by 89 since 2009 and D&G police support staff cut by 15% since SNP came to power.  #SNPcuts
No SNP members spoke in debate about unemployment. SNP record in D&G: snubbed on enterprise zones & shut out of youth unemployment finding.
Taking part in debate on unemployment in Scotland.
@DavidMundellMP The fact you can't defend it speaks volumes. We need to see a scheme that tackles our jobs crisis - esp among young people.
@DavidMundellMP So you disagree with the 2.4% success rate? What do you say the figure is?
BBC says @DavidMundellMP defending Govt Work Programme in D&G. How? The success rate of 2.4% is worse than if they did nothing at all.
Congratulations to all the children who took part in my Christmas competition! Some great designs and I hope you all enjoy your prizes.

Meeting the Council about flooding in Newton Stewart and Dumfries this afternoon.
Happy St Andrews Day!
Leveson damning of Alex Salmond. Says his readiness to assist News Corp was "striking" & it would have rendered the decision unlawful.
Like in so many areas, defence highlights the strength of a Britain working in cooperation – we are stronger, safer and better together.
We should be focused on our national security, not devoting time & money on dividing our resources to the north and south of our border.

@Daviemartin Same time as @dgcouncil is proposing to cut care packages for elderly to deal with overspend - but they can afford consultants!
Astonishing that @dgcouncil is bringing in consultants to sort out social work overspend - is there no one qualified inhouse that can do it?
Meeting council to discuss flooding in Newton Stewart, Minnigaff & Dumfries this week. Awful scenes. Residents & businesses need support.
Very disappointed that calls for a 12 month postponement of Shambellie House closure decision have been rejected. 3 months isn't enough.

Looking forward to @claudiabeamish debate on the future of Shambellie House. Hope @FionaHyslop will give a commitment to protect the museum.
I want to see @FionaHyslop commit the Scottish Government to funding Shambellie House for 12 month extension to consider long term options.
Vast majority (98%) of people taking part in the poll on my website want the Scottish Government to step in & save Shambellie. @FionaHyslop
Long term unemployment in D&G highest since Jan 1999. Both UK and Scottish Governments' need to work together to get growth into region.
Fantastic that Labour got it's best ever result in Annandale North at last night's by-election. Labour vote up from 15% in 2007 to 25% now.
Best of luck to Peter Glanton in Annandale North by-election today. Remember to vote! Polling stations open 7am-10pm.

Busy surgery in Dumfries today and trying to get some answers from @O2 for local people in Dunscore.
@O2 Can you give a timescale? Today? Over the weekend? Local people have been out of service now for a long time....
Local people getting clobbered by the energy companies - EDF hike up gas and electricity prices by 10.8%.
Read letter from @FionaHyslop where SNP wash their hands of Shambellie House http://t.co/dyxYgXe1 .

@O2 It is the village of Dunscore in Dumfries and Galloway. Eg DG2 0SY is the school.
Spoken to @O2 about signal problems in Dunscore. They tell me they can't give any indication of when it will be sorted. Not good enough.
Can SNP MSPs @JoanMcAlpine @PaulWheelhouse @AileenMcLeodMSP say why SNP Gov is not interested in Shambellie House? @GallowayNews @DGStandard
I'm angry that SNP Gov is totally silent on Shambellie House. SNP ministers in Edinburgh just happy to let it to close. http://t.co/FBH4Y5Xj

Tory and SNP councillors should be ashamed for rejecting calls for an independent inquiry on Activity Resource Centre charges. @dgcouncil
At @dgcouncil this morning to listen to the social work committee discuss ARC charges shambles.
Offensive for Rough Guide to Britain to write Stranraer off in once sentence by saying there is 'no reason to go' there.

Had a number of emails asking what I think of First replacing Virgin on West Coast Mainline. Read my thoughts here: http://t.co/GRt9wJzF
Cairnryan House report shows culture of arrogance by @dgcouncil leaders. Will Tory-SNP coalition take responsibility? http://t.co/pzAxE1gD
@jimmurphymp @Coastguard_SOS UK Govt cuts mean both the centres that cover Dumfries & Galloway's 200 mile coastline will close. V concerned.
@deacon2112 Methadone was involved in over half the deaths - too often treatment is failing. We need to look at the treatment programmes
New stats show number of drug deaths in D&G doubled in a year. Calling for urgent review.
@Ardwall_farm Absolutely. Lockerbie vital for D&G. Although outside the region, Carlisle station is also an important hub for people in Dfs.
I'm concerned about sustainability of new West Coast Mainline franchise & future fare hikes. I'm speaking to new franchise MD later today.
24% of passengers on First Group's Transpennine Express from Lockerbie are dissatisfied with overcrowding. Serious Qs about West Coast.
Long term unemployment in D&G rises for 19th month in a row. When will Tory Govt wake up to jobs crisis?
Has the Olympics inspired you to do more sport? Take part in my new poll. http://t.co/fqZgoKNd

Inspired by the Olympics? This weekend is Join In Weekend. Eddie Izzard explains...https://t.co/pOsDRFbh
Local people travelling from Lockerbie station face highest rail increase in Scotland, as they will go up 6.2% compared to Scotrail's 4.2%.
It's time to take a stand against the SNP ignoring local wind farm decisions in D&G. I'm calling Council to appeal ruling in the courts.
Make sure and follow @ParalympicsGB. Can't wait for them to start and have more Brits to cheer on.
Fantastic @TeamGB. 3rd in the medal table is amazing achievement. Truly #OurGreatestTeam. What was your fave moment of Olympics?
@rennie1948 Always good to see the country united, whatever the cause.
Fantastic day at #london2012. #TeamGB are doing us proud. We have 14 more medals than at same stage in Beijing.
@swfreepress @4Kenny4 @ScotRail Seems to me only fair that promotion applies to everyone. I will contact Scot Gov to find out why not.
Fantastic scenes for #TeamGB. The country is really coming together around our athletes. #bettertogether #london2012
Amazing 5 minutes. #TeamGB #london2012
Last wk Tory @dgcouncil Leader accused me of not checking facts on ARC charges. Now admits I was correct. Will he withdraw his allegations?
Looking forward to being on @leemedd show  on @aliveradio later tonight. Listen in from 9pm.
Great silver medal for Jamieson #TeamGB
Well done Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome!
Fantastic! #TeamGB
Fingers crossed for another medal from the time trials #TeamGB
@rennie1948 Hmm since nationalist campaign started support for separation has actually fallen....
First gold medal for #TeamGBl! Well done Heather Stanning and Helen Glover!
@andrewburns49 Out of interest, will @dgstandard website be changing to look like @Daily_Record ?
Regardless of views on separation, the narrow mindedness of the SNP is depressing - look at their comments on Olympics. http://t.co/Nltmfqhb
New opinion poll shows Alex Salmond and SNP are failing to convince people on arguments for separation. http://t.co/Fwfo2YzG
@EwanMarshall Very hard for graduates too - @sue_irving from DAGCAS in the news today talking about problems getting them into jobs locally.
Looking forward to being on @leemedd show tomorrow evening on @aliveradio.
@EwanMarshall V tough for everyone just now but young people are among the hardest hit. Lack of jobs + college cuts = toxic combination
@rennie1948 They should have listened to local people who rejected the wind farm rather than railroading it through.
@IndependentScot This is the same SNP who refused to give D&G any youth unemployment cash and snubbed us with enterprise zones?
Shocking new figures show that nearly 500 local firms in D&G at risk of going bust in next year. http://t.co/AYyHBvTE
Once again the SNP in Edinburgh believe they know better what is suited to D&G than the people who live here. http://t.co/E02uYQOR
Quick break for lunch and then on with roving surgey with @claudiabeamish
I've written to Scot Govt asking them to make the rail fare reduction at Stranraer permanent, not just for 2 months. http://t.co/zjCpApoY
Many congratulations to Wigtownshire Women’s Aid for all the work they have done over the last 25 years.
Doorstep surgery at Holywood this afternoon.
Gripping road race this afternoon. Big well done to Lizzie Armitstead for bringing in Team GB's first medal. The first of many! #london2012

@TeamMcLoughlin Simon could you follow me then I can send you my mobile number and we can speak rather than Tweet at each other? Fri Apr 17 18:52:18 BST 2015
@TeamMcLoughlin Simon this is bizarre - you are upset that I supposedly support KSA whilst KSA is angry that I don't. Call me & let's speak Fri Apr 17 18:46:12 BST 2015
@DavidHAllison David, many thanks, could you email me your home address and I will organise it for you? fabian@leedsne.co.uk. Fri Apr 17 18:44:43 BST 2015
@RishamNadeem No Parliamentary seat is ever 'safe', but I am never worried by democracy. Leeds NE was Tory for 97 years of the 20th century! Fri Apr 17 17:05:52 BST 2015
@urban_free45 @weechookyburdie Abuse never gets you anywhere. I have been absolutely consistent over Trident. Fri Apr 17 14:51:30 BST 2015

@Setchkopf Sorry, I love Leeds too much! Thu Apr 16 15:06:55 BST 2015

@samjermy87 My personal email address is fabian@leedsne.co.uk, you can use this to send me your contact details privately. Tue Mar 17 20:12:37 GMT 2015
@samjermy87 I have no idea how this has happened and have not been consulted. If you send me your address I will ask Councillors to contact. Tue Mar 17 20:11:44 GMT 2015
@samjermy87 @fabianhamilton No, sorry, I am not aware of this and the Council has no obligation to consult MPs because Councillors decide. Tue Mar 17 20:10:06 GMT 2015

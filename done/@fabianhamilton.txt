@camusgoalie @bfatchett Amazing! Clegg wasn't even an MP in 2003.
@Jontybark @GracieSamuels @Conservatives Hang on! Who's been in government for the past four and a half years?
@oldsilvertone Thank you so much Tony, that's really kind of you.
Unbelievable self-denial by Clegg in condemning Tories today ... or maybe it's totally believable given he's leader of the Lib Dems?
@Karenbruce @iredalepolitics No offence taken, Karen, but I'm afraid I had no say in who was invited! I doubt Tim did either.
@grouchiemarks @cllrawilkinson Oh really? And where's the evidence for that?
@RichardBore7 Oh, very funny!
@MartinWalker666 @lizgreenlive @JasonMcCartney @BBCLeeds I have never been convinced that peace IS achieved at the point of a gun.
@TC1973 @lizgreenlive But what IS the right decision, Shazad? I know this group has nothing to do with religion and are nasty terrorists.
Profound implications of Scottish 'no' vote on Thursday but blueprint for English devolution already done by Commons Constitution Committee.

@laweenatroshi So happy to see the excellent Laween today. I am sure that a huge number of people in Surrey Heath will want him to beat Gove
@PaulBarasi I think that's a little unfair - sadly the Government and FCO do not listen to Parliamentarians committed to Tibet & Dalai Lama.
@PaulBarasi I do every day, especially as Chair of the Parliamentary Group for Tibet.
Huge sadness at the death of Dr Ken Shenderey, wonderful man, respected member of Leeds Jewish Community. Will be greatly missed by all.

@Gurkhamum Don't know, don't control P&CRC agenda. You should ask Chair or Clerks but I would be happy to support your work & evidence.
@mandy_paine_mbe Missed you too! Sorry I wasn't there but glad meeting went well. Still abroad with Select Committee though.
@mandy_paine_mbe So sad to hear about your Mum, Mandy. Much sympathy to you and your family from the Hamiltons.
@mandy_paine_mbe It's a pleasure, Mandy, you're always in my thoughts. Sadly I won't be there on Wednesday as I'm abroad with Select Cttee.
Really sad to hear the news that Tony Benn died this morning aged 88. Whatever your politics, he was a great man and we'll really miss him.

@jonathanaddy @BBCLeeds @NickAhad I'm proud to say that over 17 years I have helped thousands of constituents as their local MP.
@andybanjobrown Absolutely - it's a scandal that the Government did this and we have to stop it if we can.
Lovely meal and great company with @eevriviades & the Leeds Greek Community celebrating Feast of the Three Heirarchs at Church in Harehills
@simonhall1974 It's Veronica King (@vron_king) who will be the next Labour MP for Elmet and Rothwell.
@simonhall1974 @MarkBW_WY No, I'm afraid not - Kippax is in Tory Elmet.
@Jane16Jt @TheOKFoundation Would be happy to but I'm in Paris next week on Select Committee business. Contact my office to fix a meeting.
@crg121 Yes, very big shoes to fill. We will very much miss our wonderful George Mudie but Richard will be a worthy successor.
Congratulations to Richard Burgon who was selected today as Labour Candidate for Leeds East. He'll make a great MP.
@andybanjobrown @oxfamleeds @SMKcampaigners @leedstidal Definitely! I will fully support an award for Mary Keynes - get well soon, Mary.

"My Dad loved Britain, he served Britain." Read @Ed_Miliband's Daily Mail piece about his father: http://t.co/9JbRsNwQUp
@Mr_Simon_Fraser @fabianhamilton I wish I knew. I will push for Labour to reverse this. Probation should never be profitable.
@SamCaseyYEP Sorry, Sam, just got your message. In Iceland at the moment and will try to call in morning before work. 1 hour behind here.
@paulaerwe Thank you. Quite agree!
@JamesWillby @UKLabour So it's perfectly OK for British jobs to be preserved by making products which only kill foreigners? #immoral.
@SimulSystemsLtd @RicHolden @NickyAACampbell If you'd actually heard what I said, I did not advocate closing Arms industry for self-defence.
Hysterical reaction of some press to what I said on 5 Live shows what vested interests are threatened when UK Arms Industry is criticised.
@PhilipMeeks ... or email at http://t.co/uIkKUXtFCB@parliament.uk.
@PhilipMeeks Philip, could you post it direct to my office at 335, Roundhay Road, Leeds, LS8 4HT?
@PhilipMeeks Thank you. As soon as we receive it we'll acknowledge your letter and deal with the issue.
@PhilipMeeks Sorry Philip, we've checked all our records and have never received any letter from you. Could you please re-send?
@RCRoundhay Thanks for the invite but I'm abroad with my Select Committee so will be unable to join you, sorry. Will be there in spirit!
@andybanjobrown @allpartycycling @LeedsCyclists Would love to, Andy, but sadly I'm abroad, so won't be there -except in spirit!
@Mr_Simon_Fraser Shame. Probation must NOT be privatised. Labour should speak out clearly against probation for profit.
@Sport_England Delighted for N Leeds Cricket Club. Excellent news of £50k Sport England grant.
@louisemartin25. Thank you so much, Louise.
Astonishing! Government loses vote on Syria military action in House of Commons tonight. Sense at last.
It's ten years since the momentous votes in the Commons on Iraq. Have we learnt nothing? Violence breeds further violence.
Just waiting for vote in Commons on Labour amendment to Government Syria motion. Tense atmosphere after powerful debate. Echoes of Iraq.
@leilaandalan Meaning? See my previous tweets on Syria.
I hope the Labour Opposition will vote against military intervention in Syria tomorrow night in the House of Commons. I will.
@PhilCane But we have no way of knowing whether strikes will work. Diplomacy has to be given a chance. We kill more Syrians if this happens.
Await text of Government motion to be debated by recalled Parliament tomorrow. Cannot support military strikes which will only make it worse
Can military strikes ever be right? Grave reservations about Government's plans for Syria - how many more innocent people must die?
@TheSocBiz No, sadly not. I'm away on Select Committee business which is a great shame. Committed as ever to cycling though.
@strawbleu @stephenfry Very moving and powerful and I completely agree with him. Read Stephen Fry's letter at http://t.co/Hc17qlvL0Q

Thank you @SadiqKhan for an excellent speech and great Q&A at Leeds NE Labour dinner tonight at Akmals. Hope you got home safely & not late.
Great Leeds NE Labour fundraiser at Akmals with guest speaker @SadiqKhan. Well attended & lovely atmosphere. Thank you Mohammed Choudhary.
Told Commons that East Coast Rail run by Govt should not be privatised. £640m earned for Taxpayers in 3 yrs vs£200m from Virgin in 15 yrs
@NaylorMEUK Thank you, Lloyd. Password changed, good advice followed.
@TheSocBiz @alexsobel Certainly will! The report contains some very good ideas which can be easily implemented to improve cycling for all.
@rayuela62 Thanks Rob, password now changed!
@hoochalobster Hacked I'm afraid. Password now changed – thanks for letting me know.
@EDFROG Hacked I'm afraid. Password now changed!
@kathryningold Really sorry that it's not available online, only in print.
Read my article in this week's 'House Magazine' on free end of life social care and why it's so important.
@johng1959 Congratulations John. You're most welcome to my speech, though I'm not sure it will be entirely appropriate.
@JoannaBlack16 Thank you so much Joanna, we've had an amazing day.
@janeslowey Thank you Jane, it went very well indeed. Beautiful service, beautiful couple, brilliant day.
@SaveShaker Sadly I cannot attend owing to clashing Select Committee meeting. Will certainly support the campaign #shakeraamer #guantanamo
Delighted that today my eldest daughter Ella gets married to fiancé John Fallows - 33 years and 3 days after Rosy & I wed. Perfect weather.
Opened debate today on bus services and young people looking for jobs training & education with @SarahChampionMP & thanks to @angelasmithmp
I asked Health Secretary in Commons to apologise to Yorkshire families for closure of Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Unit but apology denied
Happy Vaisakhi to all my Sikh constituents and friends throughout the UK. Congratulations on a great event in Millennium Square, Leeds today
@CllrPeacock Thanks, Chris. It was my birthday - 58 and feeling it! Hope you're well.
@jallcock01 Thank you so much Jonathan. Hope to see you at the school soon.
@jallcock01 @bagelnash Very sad and upset by this terrible news and will work with Moortown ward Councillors to try and save the shop.
@Andrew_S_Hatton No, I am not so important! But I thought my constituents might want to know, and some did.
@Andrew_S_Hatton I'll try! Just hope someone's listening.
@Andrew_S_Hatton Yes, I have made it clear to everyone working in our excellent probation service I will strongly oppose privatisation.
@oslodidds Yes, and we're going to make sure he does @StuartAndrewMP @GregMulholland1 #reopenleeds
Pleased to read @Ed_Miliband's very good quote on the New Statesman website today clarifying Labour's position on welfare reform. Timely.
@StuartAndrewMP, @GregMulholland1 Hoping all goes well for our children & families when heart surgery re-starts in Leeds today #reopenleeds.
Well, I'm not going to pay any tribute to Margaret Thatcher in Parliament today.
@jmccabe09 Could you kindly tell me more? Not sure what you mean: of course I am opposed to child abuse, like every other sane person.
@alexsobel That's so kind of you Alex, but I'm afraid that my birthday's actually on Friday!
@StuartAndrewMP, @GregMulholland1 We will all continue to work cross-party for #reopenleeds and hold those who closed it to account.
Just about to appear live on @BBCLookNorth to talk about #reopenleeds Children's Heart Surgery. Hoping it re-starts early next week.
Dr Gibbs, on whose statistics Boyle advised Keogh that Leeds children's heart surgery was not safe, is 'appalled' at way they've been abused
@neilpennock Yes, without doubt. The pain caused to Yorkshire's children & families these past few days is totally unacceptable #reopenleeds
All Yorkshire's MPs must now ensure that those who forced Leeds children's heart surgery unit to close are now held to account #reopenleeds
How could such senior NHS scientists use data they knew to be flawed and cause so much pain to Yorkshire's children & families? #reopenleeds
Great news that Leeds children's heart surgery is to reopen but someone has to answer for the way families have been treated. #reopenleeds
The fight for Children's Heart Surgery in Leeds continues. The politics mustn't obscure the only important people – children & their parents
Well attended briefing on Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Unit this morning. Shame on senior NHS officials for their unforgivable actions.
@exracer99 I wish I had enough time to read all such articles, but I have read this. My commitment to restoring the NHS is religious.
@rayprocter @alexsobel Ray, did R Leeds and 5 Live yesterday & 5 Live at 10pm tonight. Involved for past 3 years. Disgusted at closure.

@izzysolts Thank you Isaac. Equality is the true basis of a civilised society. I am passionate about equality.
@PeteZanzottera @tomriordan I quite agree, Pete. We need to totally change the way we see cycling in Leeds and make it safe for everyone.
@McPartlandJohn Thank you John, you're quite right - a great day for fairness, justice and equality.
@chrisjlovell Always pleased to support your rights Chris. Equality should be every elected person's dream which should become a reality.
Chaired Westminster Health Forum seminar this morning on future and funding of palliative care. Tom Hughes-Hallett an inspiration.
Pleased that tonight's vote in Parliament was such a resounding one in favour of equality. 400 in favour, 175 against.
Today is the 25th anniversary of the death of Mario Uziell-Hamilton, my father and my inspiration. Still hugely missed.

@McPartlandJohn Thank you John, I am really grateful for your very kind comments. It was a moving debate.
Thank you to everyone who tweeted such generous comments following my speech to the Commons this afternoon on Holocaust Memorial Day.
Louise Ellman MP (Lab, Liverpool Riverside) spoke about Jewish Community Security Trust help given to stop attacks against British Muslims.
Very high standard of speeches in Holocaust Memorial Day debate in Commons - Parliament at its best, shame more MPs not present.
John Mann MP, (Lab, Bassetlaw) & Chair of Parliamentary Committee on Anti-Semitism to speak tomorrow in Budapest Parliament tomorrow.
Graham Evans (Con, Weaver Vale) making point about worrying views of Hungarian far right party's anti-semitism has support of 17% of voters.
About to speak in Commons debate on Holocaust Memorial Day. Sombre mood, serious content.
Votes at 16: MPs say "yes" by 116 votes to 47 against.
@ALCKRT You are most welcome and I'd be pleased to meet you when I'm not in Parliament.

@stuartclarkeuk No, maybe it's not top priority, but it's worth debating and we need to engage young people or democracy has no future.
@SuhaiymahMYP Yes, I am co-sponsor of the Commons motion and debate. I will be speaking for votes at 16 too.

@SJCeleven @alexsobel Always have supported Equal Marriage and always will. I hope my Parliamentary colleagues of all parties do the same.
@alexsobel Must have missed this Alex. Which right thing are you confident that I will do?
@SgtGreen100 Sorry but I don't know who you are. Please re-send email to fabian@leedsne.co.uk where it will get my personal attention.
@andybanjobrown @leedscyclists @kari_leeds @leedstidal. Already responded supporting two cycling lanes on Harrogate Road with enforcement.
@andybanjobrown Israel's announcement that it will build new settlements on the West Bank is very unhelpful to the cause of lasting peace.
@andybanjobrown Peace is only possible through bilateral negotiation not through unilateral declaration.
@andybanjobrown It doesn't matter whether or not I support recognition of Palestine by the UN what matters is whether Israel does or not.
Good meeting at Leeds NE Labour Party tonight with @ChriswMP to discuss Fire Service cuts in W Yorks. Thanks for coming Chris.

@mark4westyorks on #BBCLeeds has a clear plan for minimising effects of police cuts. Collaboration with Councils & proceeds of crime income.
#BBCLeeds Interviews with all four PCC candidates - Domestic Violence must be taken more seriously. Tragic murder of Clare Brown highlighted
@mark4westyorks: "Victims of crime in West Yorkshire must be priority for Police & Crime Commissioner to be elected this time next week".
Tragic case of Michael Brown's daughter murdered in Manchester on #BBCLeeds - highlights need for change in law but can PCCs do anything?
@mark4westyorks on #BBCLeeds saying he has met thousands of electors across region to talk about importance of Police & Crime Commissioner.
@mark4westyorks on #BBCLeeds saying he will fight cuts to W Yorks Police, stop privatisation and use POCA to bring £6m a year back to region

@susanas4321 Yes I will sign EDM as soon as possible. ATOS must be removed from disability assessment.
@mark4westyorks by far the best contribution at #WYPCChustings in Bradford tonight. Only candidate to condemn police cuts and privatisation.
#WYPCChustings Awful speeches from LibDem, Tory & Independent candidates who failed to say what they would do to make police accountable.
At JUST West Yorkshire Police & Crime Commissioner hustings in Bradford -@mark4wyorks by far best speaker so far.

@RachelReevesMP thank you Rachel - that was quick!
Speaker refuses request by Leeds MPs for Urgent Question on closure of Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Unit. Will raise it anyway in Commons.
Appalling decision to close Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Unit announced this evening. The people of Yorkshire will fight this bad decision
Tories: tax cut for the rich means they will pay more tax. The rest of us just have to pay more. It really is Robin Hood in reverse.
Tories laughing at Labour's sensible proposals for economic stimulus to reverse second recession. They don't feel the pinch they're too rich
@RachelReevesMP: "Finance Bill a massive missed opportunity". Government price of failure is additional £150bn of borrowing.
Tory & LibDem Finance Bill about to leave Commons after stealing from the poor to give to the rich. @RachelReevesMP driving home the point.
Tory Finance Bill now coming to an end but, after 2 years in office, as usual  Ministers blame everyone but themselves for second recession.
Tory Treasury Minister David Gauke attempting to justify shambolic budget in Finance Bill 3rd Reading in the Commons tonight.
Usual crap from Tory benches in Finance Bill debate tonight, rob from
the poor and give to the rich. Heard it all before - it's still wrong.
Thank you to all who told me my Twitter account has been hacked. Password now changed, hope it won't happen again.
Met representatives from the Kurdistan Democratic Party today – struggling to become a free people, committed to democracy & socialism.

Excellent meeting of Worcestershire Hospice and Palliative Care professionals in Evesham today where I gave keynote speech as Chair of APPG.
It was a whirlwind last week for me being with the Dalai Lama in Leeds and in London. See my video at http://t.co/TXoGTmS7
@jeremycorbyn Thank you for your encouragement as always Jeremy. It means a lot.
Cycling from Leeds to Berlin for Heart Research, Radio JCom, Sikh Sport UK & Leeds Islamic Centre. Setting off 20th July arrive Berlin 27th.
Brilliant Roundhay Live today as rain (mainly) held off. Congratulations to everyone in the community who worked so hard to make it happen.
Great event at Leeds NE Labour fundraiser last night. Huge thanks to @edballsmp for a brilliant speech and to @alexsobel for organising it.
Compassion, forgiveness, peace and love - the Dalai Lama's universal messages to MPs & Peers on Weds in Room 14. Who could disagree?
The lovely half Burmese Blakeman family from NE Leeds came to London today to hear Aung San Suu Kyi. They were also inspired by her.
Thank you to Thubten Samdup and Chonpel Tsering from Dalai Lama's London office for brilliant visit by HH to Parliament on Wednesday.
Commons Speaker John Bercow made a passionate introduction to Aung San Suu Kyi today. Shows he still has some real politics.
Really inspiring and moving address by Aung San Suu Kyi in Westminster Hall this afternoon. Hope she soon becomes Burma's actual leader.
Testing new password
UK only European nation to allow child soldiers to be recruited. On Armistice Day, time to stop 37% of new recruits who are under 18.
Chaired fascinating meeting on Russia with guest speaker @lukeharding1968 yesterday. Amazing account - look forward to reading his book.
@SocraticPolitic No. Never have been, never would be.
@Simon_Gardner I visited the Tibetan Parliament and government in exile as part of a delegation of MPs funded by the Tibet Society UK.
Self-immolation by Tibetan monks a real tragedy. Shame FCO Minister Jeremy Browne couldn't give a better answer to my question yesterday.
Big difference between UK & Irish Governments though, Labour is part of the coalition here and there's a big appetite for punishing bankers
In Dublin with Constitutional Reform Committee talking to Irish politicians and academics about constitution and coalition government.
Sorry to everyone who is receiving spam tweets allegedly from me. This one is really from me and I'm trying to stop the virus SAP.
@David_Harney thank you very much David. I'll never give up!
Meeting new arrivals from Tibet at Dharamsala Reception Centre. Extraordinary stories of determination and resilience to Chinese oppression.
Met HH the Dalai Lama yesterday in Dharamsala with four other UK MPs. He's so inspiring, funny and has real moral and spiritual authority.
Met Abbott Rinpoche at Kirti Monastery in Mcleodganj this afternoon to hear about latest case of Monk who self-immolated in Tibet. Very sad.
Amazing to be in Dharamsala again leading delegation of UK MPs to meet Tibetan Parliament & Government in Exile. Worth the 32 hour journey!
To all colleagues and comrades: have a great Party Conference and show the media vultures we haven't lost our passion and energy for justice
A true People's Bank would give financial access to those currently denied it. Labour must develop the idea into a reality. We need passion.
Stick to the principles of Fairness, Justice and Equality to drive Labour policies and people will begin to believe in us again.
Capture the imagination of those being trampled on by the coalition as well as the wider public and Labour can win back support.
Apologising for Labour's handling of the world economic crisis would be bonkers. We need to show how we will improve the lives of the people
@Leedsrowing @tomriordan Would be delighted to support please contact me to let me know how I can help.
@YorkshireNige Happy to as soon as I can get to a computer. The link doesn't work on an iPhone!
@LazyPolitician Yes, of course. Any police brutality must be condemned but acts of kindness and bravery should be also congratulated.
Proud of Chapeltown as always.
Proud of my colleague and friend David Lammy. Excellent response to the appalling scenes in Tottenham. An MP who stands up for his community
What a wonderful wedding yesterday - congratulations to Rachel Reeves and Nick Joicey. Perfect venues at St Bartholomew's & Corn Exchange.
Remembering the victims of Hiroshima today. Visited the city two years ago and it was very moving. Time for UK to abandon Trident.
@dutchembassyUK Thanks to the wonderful and generous HE Pim Waldeck, Dutch Ambassador & his staff for all their support. We loved Holland.
@LordCourtown Thanks Patrick for your support and generosity. You are a real gentleman.
@jeremycorbyn Not necessary to swim with bikes! Ferry company helpfully booked us onto next sailing. Thanks for all your support & interest.
@Josie_Fraser Got some photos and video footage but DSLR too heavy to carry. Weather remained poor after Friday but we did it!
@PenColes Yes, Edinburgh Bikes serviced one of our bike and supplied some kit. We cycled from London to Amsterdam for 3 charities.
So far, around »1200 for St Gemma's, »500 for Refugee Council and »300 for Tong Len. Can't wait to get home - still an hour to go!
Five days away and the story gets even worse. What on earth have the Met Police been up to?
Back in the UK to find the British Media doing what they do best ... talking about each other.
Thanks to wonderful staff at Amsterdam Centraal Station this morning for helping us out after fire on the line stopped trains to Brussels.
... And thanks to all who supported our charities - St Gemma's Hospice, Refugee Council and Tong Len in India. Still not too late to give.
Nightmare train journey back from Amsterdam after successful charity bike ride. If we'd known, we'd have cycled to Rotterdam for Hull ferry!
... and if you haven't already, please give generously to St Gemma's Hospice by going to: www.JustGiving/Fabian-HamiltonMP
Land bridges across the North Sea in Holland amazing. Never seen so many shades of grey, though. Fast going on very flat Dutch cycle routes.
20 miles short of target at Delft today but very cold from rain and wet clothes. Amsterdam tomorrow, though. Less exhausted than yesterday.
Weather appalling but thank goodness for a tail wind. Dutch cycle ways are amazing but thanks to the rain only made it to Oudorrp, 65 miles.
Many thanks to ferry operators DFDS. Missed 10 am ferry so they put us on 12 noon one with no extra charge. Rail operators should do same.
Bruges a fabulous city - first visit. Had well-deserved dinner now bed in a nice hotel on the outskirts. Need sleep. Ella & Lawrie exhausted
Latest progress of charity bike ride: missed the ferry from Dover to Dunkirk so only got as far as Bruges, did almost 90 miles though. Sore!
Don't worry, we haven't!
Not too late to sponsor my ride for St Gemma's Hospice. Go to www.JustGiving.com/Fabian-HamiltonMP. Please give generously.
Arrived safely in Canterbury on circuitous route. Exhausted but getting ready for longest bit tomorrow. Ferry to Dunkirk, Bruges & Flushing.
Waved off by Dutch Ambassador and Calendar News this morning from Dutch Embassy. In Chalk, Kent, for  lunch. Just 30 miles to Canterbury.
Setting off for Amsterdam by bike from Dutch Embassy tomorrow at 9am to raise money for St Gemma's Hospice in Leeds. Please give generously
Support St Gemma's Hospice in Leeds by sponsoring my bike ride to Amsterdam on 14th July: www.JustGiving.com/Fabian-HamiltonMP. Please RT.
Waiting for Icelandic Ambassador who is briefing MPs before visit this Thursday. First formal exchange since 2008 Icelandic bank collapse.
@Sharonjandu12 I know the feeling. Hope you get to London, eventually.
House of Lords reform? Yes, but only as part of a written UK Constitutional Settlement. Time for real Citizenship in this country.
Just 19 days to go before setting off for Amsterdam bike ride to raise cash for St Gemma's Hospice in Leeds.
LibDems melting away in Leeds. They deserve whatever they get. Roll on Friday.
On streets of constituency yesterday & LibDem votes appear to be collapsing. Hope the count later today confirms Labour's Leeds Majority.
Brilliant campaigns in Leeds NE Wards of Roundhay & Moortown. Christine Macniven & Becky Charlwood will make excellent Labour Councillors.
@jrdntwltrs Thank you Jordan for your kindness and generosity.
Cycling to York as part of training for charity ride to Amsterdam in July raising money for St Gemma's and Heart Research. See Just Giving.
Great to meet Eddy Izzard again today in Leeds campaigning for a Yes vote on Thursday. Thanks for you support as always Eddy.
Superb rally for Labour yesterday in Mr Ali Shan's beautiful garden. @beckycharlwood there with Christine Macniven -both winners on Thursday
@tscholesfogg thanks, Tom. Very nice of you to do a personalised tweet! Best wishes.
Why is immigration always the last resort of the Tories? Is it a coincidence that they raise the issue whenever we're near an election?
What clever people at Search Laboratories in Moortown. Thank you Ian Morris for inviting me to formally open your wonderful new offices.
Brilliant fundraiser for Donisthorpe Home at LUFC last night. Stuart Levin really is clever. Thanks to @beckycharlwood for joining me.
@alimd55 to keep in touch, of course!
Incredibly moving first-hand account of life in Auschwitz by Survivor, Iby Knill last night in Speaker's House. Thanks to all who came.
Good luck @stellacreasy today with Credit Regulation Bill. Brilliant campaign but Sorry I can't be there - still recovering from surgery.
Well done @TristramHuntMP for debunking the big society on Today this morning.
Brilliant Burns Night Supper in NE Leeds last night. Thanks to Val, Christine and @beckycharlwood for making it possible and so much fun.
Real story of Oldham & Saddleworth by-election was collapse of Tory vote. How many ex-LibDems voted Labour? How many ex-Tories voted LibDem?
Simon Hughes may try to blame by-election failure on 'presentational issues', but in reality LibDem/Tory policies are what voters hate.
@Debbie_abrahams Congratulations on a stunning victory. Now get some well-deserved rest before we welcome you to the House of Commons.
@JenPartington I'm fighting it already. Will be meeting Councillors and have written to CEO and Leader of Leeds CC. Must save Crisis Centre
Well done George Mudie MP at today's Treasury Select Committee grilling Barclays boss Bob Diamond.
A taxi arrived at the House of Commons and the LibDem Parliamentary Party got out. Now let's focus on the real enemy - the Tories.
@jackiwk Thank you Jackie - on the road to recovery. Let's hope next week's by-election is a step on the road to Labour's recovery.
Well done @ChrisBryantMP on a brilliant performance on R4 'The World this Weekend'. You hammered the Tory & LibDem MPs. Excellent.
Daniel Rigby as Eric and Bryan Dick as Ernie in tonight's BBC portrayal of the early career of Morecambe and Wise were absolutely brilliant.
@McKinley60 thanks but I've been in bed almost all day and now can't sleep. On the mend though. Best wishes.
Let's hope that in 2011 the Con-Dems get truly exposed for what they really are.
Happy New Year to everyone.
Congratulations to my colleague Anne Begg and to my friend Keith Madeley for receiving well-deserved honours today.
Thank you to all the staff on Ward 60, St James's Hospital Leeds for looking after me whilst I had an operation today to remove kidney stone
David Miliband, don't take up the Washington Ambassador job - the Labour Party still needs you here in Westminster and in the UK.
LibDems deserve to pay for their betrayal ... and will.
No surprise that Lords voted Tuition Fee rises through with large majority. They were always quite happy to vote down Labour's measures.
Every single Labour MP voted against tuition fee rises tonight. Good to see Gordon there.
Disgusting spectacle this evening in the Commons - coalition destroyed liberal Higher Education - LD MPs abstaining, disgraceful.
Now that the Lords has passed the Equitable Bill in 1 day, unamended, it's going to be impossible to get real justice for cheated annuitants

Glad to have supported votes for 16 year olds in last night's House of Commons division. Really sorry it failed.

Watched documentary tonight on the life of Norman Wisdom. Very moving - he certainly was one of Britain's greatest comedians.
Highfield Primary School gets one of Labour's last major new buildings - opens after half term. Appalling  Condems have slashed new schools.
No pay rise for carers at a private Leeds nursing home so barely able to cope on minimum wage. There'll be much more exploitation like this.
Is @DenisMacShane being reported to the police over expenses IPSA's revenge? Never give up, Denis – you'll beat this & have a lot of support
All-Party Group on Equitable Life re-formed this afternoon with more than 30 MPs present. Victims deserve better – the Coalition MUST listen
@beckycharlwood congratulations on being selected as Labour candidate for Moortown - will be working hard to get you elected.
Tuition fees ... no, no, no! Total free market in universities? Totally unacceptable. Hypocritical Liberal Democrats. Shame on them!
A visit to Auschwitz Birkenau last week was truly moving. Read my visit blog at http://bit.ly/anWrD0.

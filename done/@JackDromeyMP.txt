Shadow Home Secretary @YvetteCooperMP asks May how she can possibly contemplate cutting an additional 20,000 police officers #MaysMayhem Mon Mar 23 15:23:13 GMT 2015
Neighbourhood policing is the bedrock of policing but according to HMIC it “risks being eroded” #MaysMayhem Mon Mar 23 15:11:07 GMT 2015
#MaysMayhem has meant that there are now 20% fewer response police officers than in 2010 Mon Mar 23 14:59:02 GMT 2015
Police morale has “sunk to its lowest ebb” according to the HASC, with a 63% increase in duty days lost due to anxiety #MaysMayhem Mon Mar 23 14:46:25 GMT 2015
With Theresa May in office, the police service has lost 16,701 police officers. That’s almost 10 police officers per day #MaysMayhem Mon Mar 23 14:40:39 GMT 2015
The last Home Office Questions of this parliament have just started. No doubt we will be hearing more of #MaysMayhem Mon Mar 23 14:37:20 GMT 2015

Conservatives up 5 gaining control with 23% swing in West Devon. Torridge up 5 from 2007. Hard work now to build on last 4 years good govt.
Listening to the fantasy world of Toynbee on 4. Like listening to Tony Benn in the 80s.

Why did Electoral Reform Soc. say of AV they did “not regard it as suitable for the election of a representative body, e.g. a parliament”.
if AV is any good - why did Nick Clegg call it a "miserable little compromise"?
If AV is any good - why is it only Papua New Guinea and Australia (for some elections) who have it and Australia wants rid of it?

Last chance to watch @meaglemp 's speech at #Lab14. It 'expires' tomorrow on iPlayer http://t.co/WGEOwgYrbY it is 1 hour and 16 mins in.
@CAupdates @NFUPolitical just to mention @LabourDefra has urged Coalition gov't for ages 2 follow Wales & tackle fly-grazing #animalsmatter
In govt we published Food 2030, a plan for safe and sustainable food. It's been gathering dust on Defra's shelves for nearly 5 years! #CPC14
Surely this is a cunning plan by Lord Ashcroft to lull Labour into a false confidence ... or is it a double bluff? http://t.co/Ig3EZphWQ1

@EmyrYoung and because foreseeable, parliament is forewarned and fore-armed
@EmyrYoung not inevitable, but foreseeable.
@EmyrYoung normal in such matters. Though collective responsibility only applies to frontbench
@EmyrYoung included in my blog is the text of the motion, and the legal advice. It does NOT include Syria.
@EmyrYoung one final point: there are consequences of inaction, as well as action. That is unarguable. Do read my blog.
@EmyrYoung whilst I respect your view, do bear in mind that many constituents did not want to stand aside, and supported intervention (2/2)
@EmyrYoung you obviously think we took such a decision lightly. We didn't. Feel free to read my blog (1/2)
On my way back home. Excited. Why? Just had topsoil delivered for garden. Ah ... I really need to get out more!

Parliament debate on #ISIL now well under way. Here is my blog from yesterday, on UK support for air strikes in Iraq http://t.co/umjU5HXF6l
@roger_scully @Amanwy yes indeed ... though I can't help it if the San Francisco 49ers are having a bad season!
@WalesForYES @DeansOfCardiff I'm with @fmwales on this - Wales should be able to choose from full menu offered to others.

@jameselliottphp although, I'd love to say we have a "design team". We're actually more of a lean operation (British understatement!)
@jameselliottphp we've only just cleaned it up, decluttered it, to try & make it simple & bold (like me!). Though any suggestions welcome...
@Bridgend yep - can email me via website http://t.co/umjU5HXF6l Many thanks. Huw
@Bridgend although if anyone else from #Ogmore would care to send me views by email (see website) I'd be glad to have them
@Bridgend some have already sent me their views (for and against) but I'll also be soliciting some views tomorrow before heading to London
@Bridgend will do. Important on any decision like this that it's considered fully, and fully explained. I'll post when ready.
@Bridgend see my last two tweets on coming to a decision - but waiting an hour is hardly "silence". Bit premature? I'll be there for debate.
@Bridgend ... and the answer is that I'm thinking it through & consulting constituents too. That way I'll come to best conclusion.
@Bridgend with respect, I've just returned from constituency meeting, & I note u tweeted me only 1hr ago! That's hardly "Silence" on my part
@LeightonLewis4 will do!

@AllieRenison I'll work on him ;-)
@AllieRenison if they don't unfollow you, you're okay!
@AllieRenison Fascinating. So, think he could be persuaded to back a #ConstitutionalConvention rather than any knee-jerk Whitehall reaction?
Sound manifesto for real country-wide devolution, not "nonsense on stilts" of English Parliament @Markfergusonuk http://t.co/lkokidH2jW
@AllieRenison if they are calling for #ConstitutionalConvention & considered public debate, that would be good. Which Tory backbenchers?
@AllieRenison Top priority: deliver Scottish promise (& make sure offer is there for Wales/NI too). Separately do #ConstitutionalConvention
@AllieRenison Agree. Cam can propose & others can oppose in Westminster. But only #ConstitutionalConvention seeks reform by&with the people

Good call by @jimmurphymp - we should have @votesat16 at #GE2015 as it will instil democratic engagement from early (and capable!) age
History will tell if #indyref was catalyst for devolution to the regions of England, and a refreshed & stronger UK constitutional settlement
Whatever the result, respecting that result is paramount in a democracy. When the people of Scotland speak, that's the final word. #indyref

@AlistairDriver @GarethEnticott IEP came to that conclusion last year. Free-shoot all but abandoned now. Time extended. Numbers unimportant.

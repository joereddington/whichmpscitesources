Easy to see why the Welsh people rather David Cameron as PM over Miliband every single day of the week http://t.co/dstfHX9IgO #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:57:24 BST 2015
Labour all over the place on zero hour contracts. If they're so bad, why won't they ban them? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:49:54 BST 2015
The poorest pupils in Labour-run Wales are 50% less likely to get good GCSEs than the poorest pupils in England #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:41:54 BST 2015
Miliband skirting the issue of schools - something to do with Labour's record in Wales? #leadersdebate #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:40:33 BST 2015
Labour said they "took their eye off the ball" on education in Wales. Why should we believe Miliband would be any different? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:37:05 BST 2015
If Labour are so trustworthy on the NHS, why do Labour in Wales refuse to hold an independent inquiry into problems here? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:58:29 BST 2015
Ed Miliband asks us to trust Labour on the NHS - Labour in Wales the only party to cut NHS spending #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:42:31 BST 2015
Sturgeon dominating Miliband even in TV debate, very worrying for Wales #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:30:29 BST 2015
Ed Miliband refuses to answer question about Wales - no surprise from the man who has to be dragged here by his advisers #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:28:39 BST 2015
Absolutely no difference between Labour, Plaid, SNP, Greens and others tonight: more spending, more borrowing, more debt #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:16:22 BST 2015
The only way Ed Miliband will win this election is with a piggy back from the SNP - disaster for Wales #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:07:53 BST 2015
The SNP are no friend to Wales - Wales would be the biggest loser in an SNP/Labour stitch up #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:06:41 BST 2015
Only David Cameron can secure the economic recovery for Wales - tonight we'll see how Ed Miliband would put that all at risk #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:05:00 BST 2015
The anti-business instincts of Labour under Miliband are frightening. Now openly   attacking job creators.  New Labour is very dead. Wed Apr 01 22:19:07 BST 2015

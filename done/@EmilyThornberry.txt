Ed: where was mention of Public Services & NHS? Red book shows cuts at X2 pace of this govt. But their failure means they plan massive cuts Wed Mar 18 13:50:31 GMT 2015
Ed: Chancellor claims that halving deficit is " a great triumph". PM used to say such a reduction wld be "totally inadequate" #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:47:47 GMT 2015
The thing is this, despite all Osborne's silly boasting & ridiculous claims, they'll be out in 6 weeks & won't be implementing #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:30:11 GMT 2015

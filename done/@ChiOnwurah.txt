But were #GNRmillion 'highlights' too bitty? & is it available as a whole to download, constituents want to know @MaggieVamos @NewcastleCC
The BBC tell me that their  #GNRmillion coverage was on Sunday morning during the run rather than during the opening itself. Did that work?
I ask Minister if he agrees McDonald's should respect local democracy & not appeal #nomcdonaldskenton & he tells me I am absolutely right!
Meeting  BBC today, will ask why so few working class & BME voices  & why brilliant #GNRmillion opening  wasn't on shown. Anything else?

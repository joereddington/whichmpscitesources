Cameron is #invisibleman - marginalised in Europe; unable to defend record on NHS & immigration. That's why he didn't want head2head debate. Thu Apr 02 21:14:20 BST 2015

Cameron is misleading on his extreme spending plans. IFS says his cuts are 'twice the size of any cuts over this Parliament' #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:31:41 BST 2015

Listen to @BBCNewsbeat for my chat with @NewsDeclan ahead of today's launch of our #LGBT anti-bullying strategy: http://t.co/LH2JGslYZH Tue Feb 03 12:29:04 GMT 2015
In his speech, David Cameron has revealed that school spending is set to face a real-terms cut under his plans for school spending. Mon Feb 02 14:18:20 GMT 2015
Cameron's bluster is hot air. He signed off on unqualified teachers. Teacher quality is the radical reform agenda: http://t.co/gvenUEWOBt Mon Feb 02 07:25:03 GMT 2015
@curv_org @TeacherROAR Stop moaning.  Read the speeches.  Do some work. Your industry will be rewarded, Sun Feb 01 23:06:01 GMT 2015
@chrismcd53 @chemistrypoet @emmaannhardy @jordyjax All set out with ruthless clarity here http://t.co/gUpexY553b Sun Feb 01 21:47:21 GMT 2015
@emmaannhardy @chrismcd53 @jordyjax I'm cool with that. Sun Feb 01 21:40:12 GMT 2015
@curv_org @TeacherROAR certainly can - http://t.co/gUpexY553b Sun Feb 01 21:35:26 GMT 2015
@chrismcd53 @jordyjax @emmaannhardy Not sure about that.  I remain firmly in the radical centre... Sun Feb 01 21:31:23 GMT 2015

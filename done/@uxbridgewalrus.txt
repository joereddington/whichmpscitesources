@uxbridgewalrus
@PhilOpus @HotbuckleProds @Brays_Cottage Sadly not. But next time you are in North Norfolk or South Kensington....
@HotbuckleProds @uxbridgewolf @Brays_Cottage I'm sure it just added something to the performance. Tasty aren't they. Interval food?
@emilyjlockwood @Brays_Cottage @uxbridgewolf  How very Austen.
@RuislipEagles @Hillingdon @GetWestLondon @NBakerParaRider Good luck. Fly the flag for us all.
@dallagliofdn Delighted to be there with you. Looked like all the hard work was paying off. Young people getting involved.
@Brays_Cottage I understand @uxbridgewolf @emilyjlockwood and @HotbuckleProds have collected. #happythesps
@WMDX_CAMRA @AngieBrayMP @nickhurdmp @FairDeal4Locals Actually I have been a member of CAMRA for a good many years. Don't always agree.
@Stu_Willoughby No I will not be attending as I have constituency engagwments. Sorry.
@CllrNickDenys @Uxeditor @nickhurdmp Sorry not following you there?
@WillGazette Not for the first time either. He was here way back with "Only Fools and Horses" #Uxbridgewood
@con1601 A real pleasure to meet you. Looking forward to working on this.
@Stu_Willoughby Apologies. Letter in post.
@JD_dewey @GetWestLondon @uxbridgewolf Sadly not. Neither for me.
@FixersGemma @con1601 @FixersUK I will be down to meet you shortly.
@balconyshirts Keep calm and head for port. (Or another fortified wine.)
@balconyshirts Check on the website.
@antpickles @GylesB1 @williamschrism @BBCRadioWales @VaughanRoderick @SCrabbMP It's an award winning beard!
@SCrabbMP @Independent It's the power of the beard.
“@Independent: The best beards of 2014   http://t.co/E7llQtrKhv http://t.co/CmdTCPmS3C”Well done @SCrabbMP
@balconyshirts Only a gentle step away. Come join my world ,
@balconyshirts Try sandals- it's the beardies answer.
@PaulThomas992 @Natures_Voice @britwildlife Have you tried draping mussels about your person to attract sea-ducks! Eiders keep you snug.
@bhen1844 @ChalgroveSchool Good stuff Chalgroveschool!
@antonylittle That would be a real disaster for all!
@antonylittle Phew!
@gregknightmp Don't panic!
@flamingodave I think not. Enjoy the evening.
@CleyOldTownHall Looks great. Smaklig måltid! Bon appetit or whatever it is in Norfolk.
@trinitytheatre @HotbuckleProds  Good luck with Persuasion tonight. It's a great production. A very special one tonight. #theshowmustgoon
@CleyOldTownHall Good luck with your first Supper Club tonight. Menu looks fantastic. We hope we will be able to come to one soon.
@Uxeditor Good news I hope. #fingerscrossed

@arniesma Absolutely, the same memory for me
. @JeffGazzard @balconyshirts @CazzaN69 Here you are - my film debut. https://t.co/Do8RfQKHTg a split second at 32.43
@arniesma There have been some others, going back to Dixon of Dock Green. A few weeks ago Toast of London. More on the way too.
@balconyshirts @CazzaN69 As always time marches on inexorably.
Anyone interested in contributing to the debate on political engagement?  http://t.co/bR3aQ4vLnb
@uxbridgewolf Have a look at this https://t.co/dZKRPjBQED 4.30 in Randalls Toy Department. I remember watching them film
@balconyshirts @CazzaN69 @uxbridge I remember it well. Well spotted. Now https://t.co/dZKRPjBQED about 04.15 in. Randalls toy dept.
@MitchellAT You might be getting a special one.
@SallyHitchiner Glad it made you smile. #phew
“Proud to support the first @WorldPancreatic Cancer Day on 13th Nov:  http://t.co/zvQSJftahJ #WPCD2014”
@SallyHitchiner Yes I am down there next Thursday. How are the rabbits?
@SallyHitchiner I am sorry for this bureaucratic mistake. I will try to make sure the office sort it out.
@DavidEvennett I should you think you went down a storm. Well done David. You play and I'll sing.
@TheSunTVBiz @TheSunNewspaper @THERussellGrant back! Great news. Middlesex forever
@GlynDaviesMP @Nigelrefowens You are absolutely spot on Glyn. A great ref and deserves full respect not just as a ref but as a great man
Great meal as always in @thegeorgeatcley last night. Venison sausages very tasty.
@Brays_Cottage @EDP24 @BBCNorfolk Ready.
@alstewitn @tracey_crouch @carldinnen There's always a plan. I think this was to bolster the flagging Miliband.  Lunch another good plan.
@alstewitn @tracey_crouch Cunning plan, I suspect.
@BarryHartness @FGW Barry lets know the details.
@Brays_Cottage @cromertrophies @MarinaFlo I will rely on my happy memories. Or I will float across on an ice floe!
@Brays_Cottage @cromertrophies So have I. Great photo.
@divakazza My pleasure.
@sajidjavid @gt1588 Very impressive. Performance by musicians extremely moving.
@bbcww1 New drama about Flora only a few months away. #watchthisspace
.@faisalislam Perhaps he has just found out that nightingales are migrants.
@VerdantWildlife @MarkAvery @birdersagainst @wildcrimeaware So very disappointing. #understatement
. @PaulThomas992 @rbnUK @MarkAvery @_BTO What sort of message does this send out? Shameful! #gutted
@JeffGazzard @Brays_Cottage Especially where food is concerned.
@Brays_Cottage  Anything you say Sarah
@balconyshirts @fdwashbag Been celebrating revolution tonight. 25 years since the Velvet Revolution. Czech & Slovak embassies.
@mrsteedUK Fascinating - thanks.
@TC_McCall @ConHistGrp they were the sons of Lord Hillingdon. Their house is now the American Community School.
Charles Mills was the MP for Uxbridge and son of Lord Hillingdon. http://t.co/tGq7PC3Dq3
Just attended a short but moving service of Remembrance for those MPs and Peers who died in the Great War, including Hon Charles Mills MP
@FlyingVicar05 You will be there to ale sure she doesn't overdo it.
@AnneMiltonMP We are like brother and sister.
@FlyingVicar05 Glad to see her out and about and Happy Birthday .
@Mrs_angryjones @greg0ryt And very effective too. A force to be reckoned with!
@tracey_crouch I would be with you but I am in the main Chamber for the Modern Slavery Bill.
@Mrs_angryjones @greg0ryt Spot on!
@Kerri_Prince @le_nurbonline I do think that every election is important or are you saying that it wasn't important when I was a candidate?
@le_nurbonline @MitchellAT Where are the nearest polling stations now? Is there a report somewhere online?
@Saracens Can't wait for the game to start. Thanks  @JollyHog for the magnificent manwhich as you told me "magnificent"
@heavensby @balconyshirts No funds available I'm afraid.
@balconyshirts @heavensby How about composing an Uxbridge anthem or an Ode to Boris?
@balconyshirts @heavensby There was a fantastic one in Windsor Street. I found it very difficult not to buy something every visit.
@SmallwoodCorner @le_nurbonline It did indeed. I supported putting it in but there was a very poor turnout.
@RogerDewey1 @PrivateEyeNews @bou At best he is a recent convert. I had a row with him well before he left. Dismissive of nightingales then.
@heavensby I think we should support the existing bookshops who have a tough job fighting the internet. What about a second-hand bookshop?
@le_nurbonline Did you know that there was a polling station on campus a few years ago as an experiment to see if it increased voting?
@Natures_Voice Sorry, it's a canteen of Spoonbills.
@GylesB1 Thank you for a great evening.
@Brays_Cottage @GWCT @BromptonFoodMkt Well I can just try best.
@KingChicken I guess it is for the St Andrews development. It is a real pain I agree.
@Mike_Fabricant You shall go to the ball. #cinderella
@balconyshirts @BromptonFoodMkt @Brays_Cottage Not any fat in those pies. But hey, retailers together.
@JournoBird @GWCT @Brays_Cottage @BromptonFoodMkt To be fair it was just the one! But you should taste it.
@Brays_Cottage @BromptonFoodMkt ooh, don't tell Mrs R or I'll cop it.
Thank you @Brays_Cottage for supplying @BromptonFoodMkt . only 4 stops away from Westminster. #yum
Just returned from speaking @GWCT conference. Drizzle and queues at South Ken station but bought @Brays_Cottage pie at @BromptonFoodMkt !
@blackgull Good read.
@EmmaWade89 Still waiting for the email.
@Emily__Knight Hope you are cheering on Sarries.
@andymcsmith If you send me an email address or telephone number to randallj@parliament.uk I have some info on vultures in Catalonia
@turnoffRL @AntiSlaveryDay  A very powerful presentation in the House of Commons today.
@DominicGilham @MayorofLondon The Randall one presumably past its sell by date.
@Mrs_angryjones @HS2ltd Can I apply? Looks right up my street.
@nsoamesmp None braver. - the nurse that is.
@JournoChewit87 @AnthonyLongden1 you are a lucky man. He is a legend.
“@uxfc_redarmy: Uxbridge Cole scores . Uxbridge win 4-3” Fantastic result. Well done lads.
“@uxfc_redarmy: HT Uxbridge 1 ROMFORD 0” keep it going you Reds!
@Mike_Fabricant @CherylGillanMP Lots of colleagues here. Great support for @CherylGillanMP and she has been very generous on interventions
Great speech on Hs2 compensation by the indomitable @CherylGillanMP
What a welcome sight on the doormat. @BirdwatchExtra . Thanks http://t.co/dR8w4taP7b
@kellydrbrown They are mad! But it will be Sarries gain. We know your true worth!
@FlyingVicar05 They were indeed. John Ogdon performed there too the same week.
@FlyingVicar05 @JonBergdahl @jamesacraig @wmtucker @Warren_Weir I still do.
@JonBergdahl @jamesacraig @FlyingVicar05 @wmtucker @Warren_Weir Yes indeed. It was still a cinema and I was very young. Sir John Barbirolli!
@jamesacraig @JonBergdahl @FlyingVicar05 @wmtucker @Warren_Weir Well I can remember being taken to hear the Hallé orchestra there.
@fifisyms Don't worry they will be big enough in a month or two.
@JonBergdahl @FlyingVicar05 @jamesacraig @wmtucker @Warren_Weir That's a familiar sight.
@emilyjlockwood @uxbridgewolf @clareharlow @AdrianPreater But you will miss the seabirds - shearwaters, petrels etc. #priorities
@emilyjlockwood @uxbridgewolf @clareharlow @AdrianPreater Hope the crossing is calm. Lots of opportunity for snoozing though.
@HotbuckleProds Have a great performance tonight. Can't wait to see it over here.
@MerchantTaylors Great occasion, seems not long ago when I attended as an adolescent myself. WWI readings particularly poignant #homoplantat
@paulwaugh Uxbridge is pretty much the centre of everything though.
@DLidington And it's available in the Queen's Head, Uxbridge too. Great to meet all your excellent Chilterns producers.
@TenTenTheatre @HumanTraffFdn @MedailleTrust @solong I hope so. I am sure anyone seeing it will be moved.
@TenTenTheatre @HumanTraffFdn @MedailleTrust Thank you so much for yesterday's #ThisIsMyBody . Absolutely stunning
@TenTenTheatre @EmmaWade89 @HumanTraffFdn Brilliant and very powerful. Yesterday's production #ThisIsMyBody
@fdwashbag @TFL Very disappointing to say the least. Lucky I checked before I left. Sorry for those not so lucky.
Redwings overhead tonight.
@PhilOpus @HotbuckleProds I specialise in awesome!
@HotbuckleProds @PhilOpus Rightly so.
@PhilOpus @HotbuckleProds how about meeting a member of the cast at Louth?
@cgwOMT @HotbuckleProds @uxbridgewolf He had to cut his legs off for the role.
@HotbuckleProds Has he just seen an interesting piece of furniture? Or an auk?
@HotbuckleProds do tell. Naughty?
@guardian Vrlo ukusno!
@Willeth I agree but it is easier for me to get to West Drayton from Cowley.
So the @metline has severe delays. Cunning plan needed. West Drayton to Westminster via Paddington. We do have great transport links here.
Well done @WaspsRugby . You deserve that win for the fans.
Just turned on Wasps v Bath. What a game. C'mon @WaspsRugby give your fans a boost after a difficult week.
@hillyparkbc It was a very great pleasure and uplifting too. Such friendly and welcoming people.
@hillyparkbc Happy Birthday. Privilege and pleasure to share this morning with you. Thanks for allowing me time to talk about Modern Slavery
@TimMontgomerie @SamuelCoates I would say that there is avery great deal indeed. But just as elsewhere sufferes try to hide it but more so.
@SchalkBrits @AllianzPark Looking forward to seeing you dance too. Been waiting a while.
@HotbuckleProds Standing ovations! Great stuff. England awaits with excitement!
@MrsB2003 @HuffingtonPost Now you know the real reason I am standing down.
@akchevalier Belated congratulations to you and Mrs C on your new arrival.
@HotbuckleProds So gentle folk how persuading is the latest production. I hear it is another stunning success. Can't wait to see it.
@balconyshirts And may I add, a very good question too.
@PhilOpus  All that for a visit up North eh?
@PhilOpus Great shots. I have the excitement of a flu jab this morning. Live the dream!
@UxbridgeGazette @Ade_Jacobs @is_M_is I have indeed and will continue to do so. One for the Mayor to look into perhaps?
@UnchosenFilm  An absolutely mind-blowingly inspirational film. Thanks for a very thought-provoking and enjoyable evening
@patrickwintour Why? Are they mad?
@PortoPetroGal Of course I will. She is a real star!
@tnewtondunn @GuidoFawkes He's probably fretting about what to wear. #morningsuit
@GregHands I will have words with TfL.
@HACAN1 @GregHands no there is an R in Richmond.
@GregHands Hillingdon must be one.
@cheekycol I have been worried about this game for a while but let's hope we can pull this one out of the fire.
@WKWood1 @SupportNWT @wildlife_uk  Ruff I would venture
@brianmoore666 Oops- but wise words. Take note.
@GcooperGeorge Welcome to Twitter. No stopping you now.
@thegeorgeatcley Another great meal. I have to say that the борщ очень вкусно! спасибо большое.
@JoshDixonTweets it's not won yet. I will have to get a Focus out. Only JR. can win here etc.
@JoshDixonTweets Well I think that is an honour. I hope the beard sways it. #careerending
@alstewitn @UKIP Perhaps it's a double - Vladimir and Estragon.
@RareBirdAlertUK ah I remember it well and a Long toed Stint in the North east at the same time.
@Birderman @trussliz Wonder whether it'll be a by-election issue. I believe Reckless very keen on building there. Doesn't like migrants?
@WildmanBeer @ChrisWyles  I know two members of my family who tasted it on Saturday and thought it was great. Well done lads.
@trussliz Goldfinches are but I think Linnets are not doing so well. Happy to brief you on birds anytime.
Vote now @AskLloydsBank #CommFund at http://t.co/k8K8FenIsw . Mine was for Eastcote House Garden Give them a chance of an award up to £3,000
@uxfc_redarmy Come on you Reds!
@Saracens @SarriesSupport Well played. That last scrum was awesome. More of the same please!
@Middlesex_CCC Well done lads. Great spirit.
@frankdoyle2730 There's a letter in the post to you explaining why. I did vote against in 2003 and resigned from front bench.
@HotbuckleProds Well that's something I suppose. Keep up the good work!
@HotbuckleProds That looks intriguing. Are there any sausages in it this year?
@MarkAvery @MayorofLondon @Conservatives @EveningStandard @LeagueACS I wonder that is all about.
@MarkAvery @MayorofLondon @Conservatives @EveningStandard @LeagueACSI'll keep on an eye on Boris I am sure that we'll be at one on Harriers.
@MarkAvery @MayorofLondon @Conservatives @EveningStandard @LeagueACS It seems to me that @MrJimboBig does not feature on twitter.
@PaulThomas992 @MarkAvery @britwildlife @MarkCocker2 As it happens I am. Any suggestions?
@balconyshirts I rather enjoyed it actually.
@BrunelCF @SmallwoodCorner That's great but do need a certain amount of notice
@Saracens @LiRFC It's nerve wracking just seeing it unfold on twitter. But well done Sarries. #neversaydie
“@uxfc_redarmy: FT Uxbridge 1 Potters Bar Town 0” well done the Reds!
@CompassTheatre It was great fun and an honour. Great book great author and great venue.
@Welshracer @Parlez_me_nTory It is indeed I relaxing in the haven that is Uxbridge.
@IsabelHardman Nothing to see here. No need for a call. #onside
@_AndyClements Birders everywhere will share the relief that there will be no post referendum deletions to their list.
English votes for English matters. Here's hoping vested interest doesn't block this.
Here we go!
@filoktimon Passport to Pimlico is one of my favourite films. Toll booths on the A40.
@michaelsavage #withdrawal symptoms
Waiting to hear the Prime Minister. Now here's comes the difficult bit. History in the making ?
I am just so delighted:relieved. Thank you Scotland.
@inclusive1 @Mike_Fabricant Starting up the car!
@Mike_Fabricant I hope you make one too.
Meanwhile in other news...I was delighted to help at launch of "Home Bases" a book about US bases around London. Great read.
@arniesma Wise words indeed.
@Welshracer @Mike_Fabricant I think it's his dacha.
@balconyshirts @ux_soulpatrol So you've seen @uxbridgewolf baby pictures then?
@arniesma The Monster Raving Loony party was making overtures but they think I am too raving for them.
@balconyshirts Not to mention Harpo.
@AngelOTheNorth Naravno.
It's the new Uxbridge look. http://t.co/3mlHE2ynIx
@Middlesex_CCC that's the best bit of good news for a whole. Great captain's knock! Well done!
@BrunelCF @SmallwoodCorner Happy to do so. When do you have in mind?
@RandallsUxb Good luck with the big sale chaps. I will pop in for a while. #youv'ealldoneverywell #youngMrGrace
@Wealdstone_FC Yes I am fine. Trying to work out when I can come and watch the Stones.
“@Wealdstone_FC: WE WON!!!!! 1-0 FT” well done. See, no need for panic.
@prop_idol_ @RandallsUxb it's a small world. That's why the PM calls me "young Mr Grace"
@SmallwoodCorner @BrunelCF You should have told me. I could have popped by. Perhaps I would put people off. #oldphart
Strange experience. Answered a call @RandallsUxb today. Has Mr Randall died as the shop is shut today? I checked then reassured him.
@Mike_Fabricant @callummay @RandallsUxb @LichfieldCath I think we need a series of shire moots.
@callummay @Mike_Fabricant The Great Barn would make a very good location. Apart from the aircraft noise of course.What about @RandallsUxb?
@Mike_Fabricant it's also time for Middlesex to awake from its slumber and be a force again. #awakeMiddleSaxons
@IamAustinHealey @RugbyTonight @Saracens Spot on about Chris Ashton.
@RugbyTonight Which is worse? Away kit of @LeicesterTigers or @LondonWelshRFC ?
@angiehunt30 good luck with it.
@uxfc_redarmy  superb win for the Reds. Looking forward to the draw on Monday.
@PaulThomas992 oh come on, it's not that black and white.
@arniesma July 1997
@balconyshirts @uxbridgewolf My favourite t-shirt was one I bought in Oz for a gift. Had a drunk platypus saying I'm totally platypissed.
@balconyshirts @hammersmithandy @GregHands @uxbridgewolf Wasn't me mate. It's all history now.

A Matt cartoon from July 1997 http://t.co/GCtuNSSQgi
@MiddlesexLondon That's kind. I am planning to stay perhaps preparing for Middlesex independence.
@balconyshirts As my old mate Franky Voltaire said famously. "Il faut cultiver le jardin" Perhaps I should get out there today.
@PhilOpus They got back a few weeks ago. Thanks.
Try as I may, can't help feeling deeply depressed at everything going on in the world today. Difficult to find that ray of sunshine.
@Mike_Fabricant Hope you've signed up.
@JHallHDI @albiondumsday @Mike_Fabricant You do indeed have a very valid point.
@antpickles @Mike_Fabricant @JHallHDI @MayorofLondon That actually is the way forward.
@Mike_Fabricant @JHallHDI @MayorofLondon oh come on. It's so fashionable.
While I have been elsewhere I see that @saracens thumped Quins. What am evening.
Good luck to all four candidates tonight #UxbridgeSelects
Good luck to @Saracens tonight. Sorry I can't be watching. @SarriesSupport
@antonylittle I think I would agree having seen your holiday snaps.
@cr_daley Thank you but time to haul myself out of the water, I feel.
@antonylittle You were only a lad then. Now look at you.
@Mrs_angryjones Look forward to seeing you then.
@antonylittle Well that's kind Antony. Of course at @RandallsUxb we have classy shoes for all sizes.
Going to the selection meeting tonight is a bit like attending one's own funeral - possibly but no previous experience of either.
@MitchellAT That's what I am doing today.
@DominicGilham Good spot D. If it was me it would be Hungry Games. See you tonight.
@clippy01 Martin, whoever is chosen I will be happy to work with and I am confident the local area will be at the forefront of their mind.
Selection meeting tonight to decide who'll be next Conservative candidate for Uxbridge and S Ruislip. "May the odds be ever in your favour"

@NadineDorriesMP That's brilliant. Chip off the old block?
@JournoBird That is sad. I am sorry to hear that.
@JeffGazzard @runwaysuk @Telegraph Funny that I wasn't surveyed. It was only a handful. I could choose a different 150 and come up with NO
@chrisgreen They are indeed.
@RogerDewey1 Always!
@inhoclocus @LouiseMensch Steady now. I am from the suburbs. We are very boring.
@JeffGazzard @LouiseMensch @spellar No I meant vote instead of him. Enjoy Norfolk find a @Brays_Cottage pie. Recommended.
@SkySportsNewsHQ Come on plucky Makedonija.
@iamKAQ  never mind . I still have some essays to hand in from my college days. #eternalstudent
@LouiseMensch @spellar I am up for that. Could I vote for him as well?
@LouiseMensch The world is my oyster. But it might prove to be a whelk.
I think it's back to the drawing board.
Then thought about being an extra in a Casablanca remake. http://t.co/xGCEVmjBfM
@iamKAQ Struggling along on the Metropolitan line. Early night for me. How are things with you?
Thinking about new opportunities. Went for an interview to be a DJ. Didn't get a call back. Why not? http://t.co/c56qM1ItO6
@iamKAQ David and I think bottom left. #justguessing
@Mike_Fabricant @RandallsUxb We have a selection that would be right up your street. #suitsyousir
@PhilOpus great sighting. Not uncommon if you go to a stake-out but always a great sight.
@PhilOpus Spotted by David from his bedroon window. It's in the genes.
This little chap has made doing the emails a lot more fun this afternoon. First one in the garden for a year or so. http://t.co/sOIwb9GCUx
Just caught up with the sad news of the death of Jim Dobbin MP. He was always very kind and polite to me. Sympathies to his wife and family.
@HillingdonLife When was this?
“@Saracens: .@Al_Hargreaves; "@WaspsRugby our sole focus" >>http://t.co/lxfEmMFAkN http://t.co/zwHpq0L4VJ” Good luck Sarries.
Happy World Shorebird Day. Let's get celebrating those waders! Flags out in Turnstone Close Ickenham? Let's not stint ourselves.
Looking forward to visiting @hillingdonRC @HillingdonOAC this morning. Sorry it can only be a short visit.  Sounds oarsome.
@DebWillott @balconyshirts it's not all it's cracked up to be.
@balconyshirts Too late now mate. You are a celeb.
@NadineDorriesMP Next you will be a specialist subject!
@soas I used to be a regular in the SOAS bar in the 70s when I was at SSEES and we didn't have a bar of our own. Shepherds Neame I recall.
@fionamacmp @SOAS Sorry, if it was some thing I tweeted.
@balconyshirts Alright, the freedom of Windsor Street.
@balconyshirts you deserve the freedom of Uxbridge!
@SCrabbMP bonjour matelots.
@murrisonMP I know that you are very busy but you should try to get along to this exhibition @gt1588 . They will give you a guided tour.
@fionamacmp @gt1588 It's on until 28th September. I know the pressure on all our time but really is interesting.
@inkednaturalist @BirdGuides @WorldWaders It's Knot really is it?
Great picture in today's @thetimes . Enough said. So on to Westminster! http://t.co/Rs2Fle4kru
@fionamacmp Sorry if I startled you at Baker Street last night. Just had to tell you about fab exhibition. @gt1588
Thanks to all involved with @gt1588 It's a must see exhibition at SOAS  more than WW1 @johnmcdonnellMP @fionamacmp http://t.co/Rhx3slKrbz
@carolinenokes How about now?
@carolinenokes That is very unusual. Hopefully one turned up in the end.
@Brays_Cottage @aylshamshow Work in progress.
@Uxeditor @balconyshirts @Bruneluni That's his code name I think.
@Brays_Cottage Keith Simpson had a good chat discussing the outstanding qualities of your pies. True connoiseurs.
@Brays_Cottage  The pies were much appreciated by the returnees from the US. #happykids
@balconyshirts Once bittern twice shy!
@twitchingphil @MarkAvery @PaulThomas992 @britwildlife Blooming great things. Bringing their Mediterranean ways.
@balconyshirts Careful you will become an addict. You will be a crake fiend next.
@balconyshirts Call for Isambard the super Brunel Heron. He will dispense justice with his dagger like bill.
@PaulThomas992 @MarkAvery @britwildlife Large Sylvia warblers should be barred!
@ZacGoldsmith That is wonderful news. #commonsenseprevails
“@rinkitagurav: @CGRBowden sent this and it is so true for me. #vultures #SavingAsiasVulturesfromExtinction http://t.co/hq8cMOj5QP” Me too.

@ElaineTurpin @wildlife_uk Looks like a Large Tortoiseshell to me. Worth checking out as it would be a great record.
@wildlife_uk @ElaineTurpin That is not a Small Tortoiseshell. Where was it taken?
@Brays_Cottage @norfolkcordial More than a game but a very good pie market too.
@norfolkcordial @Brays_Cottage And the start of the rugby season Saturday too!
@Brays_Cottage 3 pies ready to greet returning offspring back from the US. #BestOfBritish #parentallove also @norfolkcordial
A flock of Ring-necked Parakeets very noisy as I wait for the bus in Cowley. Can't decide whether I like them or they're beginning to annoy
@bhen1844 @ChalgroveSchool Have a good term. Good luck to both staff and pupils. Especially all those starting today!
@alstewitn @carldinnen I forget everything these days.
@alstewitn @carldinnen Who are you again?
@alstewitn @carldinnen A very pleasant lunch indeed. Still lots to chat about. A real pleasure.
@PaulThomas992 oh no! The ruffs are threatening direct action.
@PaulThomas992 The curlews are overhead as I text. They thought they were supposed to be defecting though. #waderparty
“@Mike_Fabricant: 100 yrs ago today, the last Passenger, Pigeon, Martha, died in Cincinnati Zoo. #Martha

Today marks the centenary of the extinction of the Passenger Pigeon. Read A Message from Martha by @MarkAvery. Turtle Dove next?
Wonderful fare @NNFoodFest great weather lovely @Holkham. Got some treats @norfolkcordial @Brays_Cottage. Good coffee too @Greysealcoffee
Great morning @NNFoodFest Managed to sneak some @Brays_Cottage pies. Not all for me. http://t.co/MP1H0dRf4u
@balconyshirts @heavensby @WaterstonesUxbr @RandallsUxb You are so cool and stylish.
@heavensby @balconyshirts I think there is. Both Catholic  and Protestant. It's where the Peace Memorial is now.
@heavensby @balconyshirts @WaterstonesUxbr Any item from those two emporia or even @RandallsUxb
@PeterMannionMP @afneil Exactly - couldn't have put it better myself.
@PeterMannionMP @afneil Well it won't be in Frinton then.
@pygerbeau @alstewitn @BillCashMP Fair enough. I am showing my age. What's the modern equivalent? Keen to learn
@beckmilligan @BBCPM Trouble is with kippers for breakfast, they come back at you later in the morning. I will stick to porridge I think.
@JeffGazzard Preservation of Phocids? But no captive breeding!
@NNFoodFest @Holkham Might just pop in on Saturday. Looks very tempting.
@beckmilligan @BBCPM I am often tempted by kippers. Does that count?
@kmflett I think I could go undercover there, not so much a party more a movement.
@HillChorSoc I shall watch your tweets carefully. Sentry's song Iolanthe? Dull MPs in close proximity? Some mistake surely?
@PeterBoneMP @HJMacManus For a moment Peter I was barking up the wrong DC tree. Phew.
I would like to state yah I am NOT defecting to the Monster Raving Loony party or indeed the Middlesex Independence Party. #tempted?
@HillChorSoc I do as it happens. Not choral really more G&S. I do have an impressive repertoire of Russian and Serbian songs from Uni days
@alstewitn @BillCashMP C'est vrai, mon brave.
Interesting fact. Douglas Carswell's mother was a co-author of  the Atlas of the Birds of Uganda. #justsaying
@kmflett @fdwashbag I am eternally grateful to you for all the support you have given to my beard over the years. It isn't going anywhere.
@kmflett @fdwashbag  Actually we are pretty non-conformist down here. That's why I love it and am so proud of it. Beard and all.
@patrick_kidd Oh dear . These things do come back to haunt people don't they? "Don't do as I do", comes to mind.
@BlackdogDNA @pupaid email me on randallj@parliament.uk with your address and I will send you a reply.
@heavensby http://t.co/2yhWMePQ7Z
@heavensby I will see what I can do but not really my style.
@heavensby I did indeed. Very good too.
@balconyshirts @heavensby @RickyChickens They went to a good home. They did not go on the rubber chicken circuit.
@balconyshirts @heavensby @RickyChickens The problem was Mrs R (wasn't keen on feeding and mucking them out and I didn't have the time.
@heavensby @RickyChickens We used to keep chickens at the bottom of the garden until I got elected to Parliament in 1997. Happy memories.
Douglas Carswell decision is vainglorious. That is all.
@paulwaugh @LouiseMensch @JeffGazzard Not holding my breath.
“@LouiseMensch: @uxbridgewalrus @JeffGazzard in fact @DanHannanMEP be an ideal candidate for Clacton.” That would be great.
@JeffGazzard Odds on, I guess.
@LouiseMensch By the way what's the weather like in NY today? My three kids are there at the moment.
@LouiseMensch @JeffGazzard I don't argue with that at all.
@JeffGazzard @LouiseMensch Actually most slimeballs are very well mannered. That's what gives them the slimy feel.
@LouiseMensch Douglas maybe many things but not a slimeball. Deluded? Probably.
Sorry to see @DouglasCarswell leaving the Party. Totally self defeating move for his goals re Europe in my opinion. #sorrownotanger
@Mike_Fabricant Is it that verve or nerve? Anyway most kind. However I must away to the marshes and dunes. Easterly winds!
@PortoPetroGal Not gone yet. Still there until the General Election. But thanks.
@benglaze @paulscoins @balconyshirts @Mike_Fabricant It is indeed MF before a razor graced his upper lip.
@DominicGilham @WayneBridges88 @CllrDSimmonds @Hillingdon That is a typically sensible and practical thought. I can see why you got elected.
@WayneBridges88 @DominicGilham @CllrDSimmonds @Hillingdon You are only saying that now that I am standing down.
@DominicGilham @CllrDSimmonds @Hillingdon @WayneBridges88 Think very carefully that's all. #justsaying
@CllrDSimmonds @DominicGilham @Hillingdon @WayneBridges88 Sound advice. I also know where you all live!
@Mike_Fabricant Keep away from Snow White, her chums might be upset with you,
@MarkAvery @Brays_Cottage @PaulEele I fear the rain gods are angry on the coast. Perhaps it's a clearing up shower. #falseoptimism
@arniesma I think I could still find mine too.
“@alstewitn: .@JohnStapletonTV And especially this.. (@putnielsingoal ). http://t.co/GSs0oyFJiV” Halcyon Days.
@Brays_Cottage But do they have your pies? No? No contest.
@RogerDewey1 @MarkAvery Mine was in Portugal. Unforgettable.
@RogerDewey1 @SupportNWT We are indeed. It's great to wander off to the reserve in between doing emails. Looking forward to some easterlies
@Brays_Cottage I read about the 70s in a book once.
@fretwellneil All OK. Will be getting withdrawal symptoms for rugby. Might run up and down straight lines to feed the habit.
@fretwellneil Welcome to twitter. Are we mad? Hope all is well with you.
@MarkAvery @Brays_Cottage @HarrietMead1 @NNorfolkLiving No, but I can guess where it might be going.
.@MarkAvery I might agree with you on most things - but leave Linnets alone.
@balconyshirts No, the other teams didn't even show up.
Just read "The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War" Best book I've read recently. Thanks @uxbridgewolf
@balconyshirts I think they came second.
“@Brays_Cottage: @MarkAvery @HarrietMead1 @NNorfolkLiving Lovely book. Are we absolutely certain about the word “jizz” though? ;)” we are.
@DominicGilham Sadly we do national weather not local showers. Try the GLA.
“@DominicGilham: Again I get the car washed, again it rains within 4 hours. I am sorry but this is not acceptable.” Write to the council
. @Brays_Cottage . It tastes even better than it looks. #madeimnorfolk http://t.co/9vQdb9w1qV
Bliss. Cley pie @Brays_Cottage . Thank you so much.
.@uxbridgewolf @emilyjlockwood It's on my bucket list. http://t.co/xJysX6aTyM
@RogerDewey1 @thegeorgeatcley Thank you.
Great meal at @thegeorgeatcley this evening. #asusual.
@BigBlueSkyLive @Brays_Cottage Blimey, in Holt?
@Mike_Fabricant @guardian I see why you are not happy.
@PhilOpus @LogbookLies It all depends on the wind direction.
@thegeorgeatcley Lovely church went there for Easter Day service.
@thegeorgeatcley Coming tomorrow #tablebooked
@JeffGazzard I will have to check it out.
@JeffGazzard @SalthouseDunCow Looks OK but Salthouse is great also @thegeorgeatcley is another top place. Dog friendly too.
@RareBirdAlertUK @DarrenNWoodhead Ah, now I understand how it works.
@RareBirdAlertUK @DarrenNWoodhead Juvenile Bluethroat perchance?
Super meal at @SalthouseDunCow this evening. Followed by 13 Whimbrel over the house. Not bad eh?
@DavidVick5 @urbanbirder @bird_vote Well that's certainly one view. Perhaps there is a book about British Birds, indentification and recipes
@alstewitn @EnglandRugby @RugbyCanada Absolutely. Canada were very good, indeed
“@Rugbyworldmag: Canada wing Magali Harvey has been named #WRWC2014 Player of the Year” Well deserved.
Fantastic ! England win the World Cup! Well done #WRWC2014
@EnglandRugby The very best of luck to the English women rugby team in the #WRWC2014 final. Come on ladies. We are cheering you on here!
Well done the England cricket team.
@ArgosyPlayers She seems like a great lady to me.
@Brays_Cottage @GuardianCook You should be. Have a great day.
@Brays_Cottage @GuardianCook What a great article!
@MarkAvery @BirdfairRutland I did indeed. However I am not built for t-shirts #baggyshirts
Well done everyone involved at @BirdfairRutland great day. Only missed the legendary @MarkAvery. Too busy with Martha, I guess. (Book!)
I wonder if my chum at FCO @JamesDuddridge would like a briefing? @PhilOpus @BirdfairRutland http://t.co/LnBV4s5q7q
@BirdfairRutland Good to see the African Bird Club and my old birding chum @PhilOpus . http://t.co/cPbC0p3bVw
I might have issued the march and rain last Sunday but was very pleased to meet Billy @WildeAboutBirds #HenHarrier http://t.co/5q6edPeoPH
Great day @BirdfairRutland . Met lots of old chums. Really good to meet heroes from @BirdLife_Malta @ruthpeacey http://t.co/7YzWsYx3KJ
Right. Off to the @BirdfairRutland . A1 here I come.
@Brays_Cottage @birdfair @FelbriggHallNT Sounds good. Don't overdo it. H
@macmillancancer #LivesDependOnit http://t.co/Pc7jqD4xee
I am supporting @macmillancancer We must make every effort to match the best cancer outcomes in Europe #LivesDependOnit
@Brays_Cottage That would be fantastic. Luckily I will be in the hearland of your great pies next week. @birdfair today.
@heavensby @bobfornature Bob has my vote of course.
Very brave from the French but well played Canada #WRWC2014
@brianmoore666 Well done England. A different performance today.
“@brianmoore666: WRWC - Try for England - England 26 Ireland 7 - England unrecognisable from the Canada game; performing well in all areas.”
@EnglandRugby @katymc10 @KayWilson151 Keep it up ladies. #WRWC2014
@patrick_kidd Great. Tell her to stick with it.
@patrick_kidd Just watching now. Ready for second half. Went to the last final at the Stoop. I ran the line for my daughter's team!
Good luck to the England ladies in their semi-final this evening at #WRWC2014 @EnglandRugby . Go on ladies do us proud!
@GregHands  mieć wielki czas, mój stary kumpel. I hope that's OK. It would have been easier if you went to Belgrade instead.
@ClassicFM Thank you for letting me know that today is #LeftHandersDay Best wishes to all fellow left handers out there. Go south paws!
@jameswhartonmp @fifisyms @JamesDuddridge A round peg in a round hole. Popular as well.
Congratulations to @JamesDuddridge. The new Minister for Africa. Bringing a wealth of regional experience to the job.
@JournoBird Let's hope so. We are told that there will be no more weekend closures. #fingerscrossed
@JournoBird It is certainly supposed to be. I've had an email to that effect. Lift out at Hillingdon Station, otherwise back to normal.
Hen Harriers  need more protection- show your support for #HenHarrierDay http://t.co/lGL8mF6EzH
@JeffGazzard @MarkAvery @ChrisGPackham enjoy the day, ignore the rain and get the message across that it's time for action.
Hen Harrier Day has arrived. Good luck to everyone today @MarkAvery @ChrisGPackham and everyone else.
@balconyshirts great picture.
@EnglandRugby @NHunt09 That was too close. However I note that the Black Ferms are out. Regroup and learn from that game. #CarryThemHome
@EnglandRugby Great try ladies. Now keep up the pressure. #CarryThemHome
Good luck to the ladies of @EnglandRugby against Canada. @RFU_Supporters #CarryThemHome #keepthemomentum
@UxbridgeFC Good luck today on your first match of new season against Daventry @chhcalling
@Wealdstone_FC @Pressoffwfc Good luck to the Stones on their first match of the new season. @mg94g
@daniel4shrews @ShrewsFlowerShw Mums are great Daniel.
@uxbridgewolf @GetWestLondon I will give anyone a tour (for a price)
@balconyshirts Cracking. Good job.
@GlynDaviesMP I couldn't possibly comment.
@GlynDaviesMP which one would be Leader of the Opposition?
@IsabelHardman Not to mention Iraq and Syria.
@PaulThomas992 @MarkAvery There has also been a sighting of a funny tern. Much media interest and birders hoping to get a glimpse of it.

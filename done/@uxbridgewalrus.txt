@fdwashbag @balconyshirts Rippingales. That was in Dellfield Parade. Was a toy shop once too. The other one was Mowlems. Butchers next door Mon Apr 27 23:14:27 BST 2015
@adamgale @balconyshirts It is indeed. Mon Apr 27 22:05:40 BST 2015

@balconyshirts now that is a recommendation. Mon Apr 27 21:27:49 BST 2015
@balconyshirts Can you writhe in a frozen lake? Or just drown. Mon Apr 27 21:26:53 BST 2015
@balconyshirts It was a bike shop when I was a lad. Mowlems. Might just try it out for the tagine. Thanks for the tip. Mon Apr 27 21:24:58 BST 2015

@LordTobyJug I take that as a compliment. Anyone who knows me will recognise a good streak of eccentricity. I think the tradition is safe. Tue Apr 14 13:41:51 BST 2015
@LordTobyJug That's appropriate. My great-uncle Bertie is there too. Never recovered from the horrors of the Western Front. #respect Tue Apr 14 13:39:56 BST 2015
@LordTobyJug Very sad end too. Harrow lad if I am not mistaken. Tue Apr 14 13:32:41 BST 2015
@EccentricParty He was a fellow candidate in the 1997 by-election. Always regret not meeting him properly. Tue Apr 14 13:22:22 BST 2015

@EmilioIannucci1 @hstefson @PushCDT   Luckily got mine already. Wed Feb 25 11:00:59 GMT 2015
@Mike_Fabricant The previous two MPs for Uxbridge died in office. Stay safe Mike. Wed Feb 25 10:39:02 GMT 2015
@_AndyClements That's very kind. I was wearing a vintage @_BTO tie for luck. #gogannets Tue Feb 24 18:39:09 GMT 2015
@Welshracer I know my place. Tue Feb 24 15:18:44 GMT 2015
No Peregrines at the moment from office window but a very noisy magpie in Star Chamber Court. Tue Feb 24 14:51:02 GMT 2015
@_BTO It's a few years old, I grant you.  But its first outing in Parliament. #Tringdays Tue Feb 24 09:11:49 GMT 2015
@singinghen @_BTO @rspb Now there's an idea. One round the head, Rambo style? Tue Feb 24 09:05:24 GMT 2015
2 Stock Doves in the garden yesterday. Great birds and very unsung avian good guys. Tue Feb 24 09:04:30 GMT 2015
Great to meet up with @Mrs_angryjones and @MrsB2003 yesterday. Great campaigners against HS2. Keep up the fight! Tue Feb 24 09:03:01 GMT 2015
@TheredMyers And just a little scary too! Tue Feb 24 08:59:31 GMT 2015
@the_mcquade @_BTO @rspb But I love the fact that the Hungarian for avocet is gulipan. Tue Feb 24 07:58:24 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts @_BTO @rspb I have an oryx @FaunaFloraInt too. Pity you don't do ties - never been a great t-shirt man. Tue Feb 24 07:57:36 GMT 2015
@NadineDorriesMP I shall miss you and other good chums. Time to migrate though. Tue Feb 24 07:56:18 GMT 2015
@TimHodge7 Well I owe it to all of my old birding chums like you, as well as our kids. Tue Feb 24 07:55:03 GMT 2015
Decisions, decisions. The gannet @_BTO tie or the avocet @Rspb one. Both seen better days. (Like me) http://t.co/m1NR3IzJaE Tue Feb 24 07:54:04 GMT 2015
Introducing a 10 minute rule Nature Bill today. Will this be my last speech in Parliament. Who knows. Thanks to all my co-sponsors. Tue Feb 24 07:39:11 GMT 2015
@PaulThomas992  I was disappointed that the Jack Sniper wasn't recognised however. Mon Feb 23 08:00:03 GMT 2015
What a way to end the day. Barn Owl past kitchen window followed by a fantastic and delicious meal as always at @SalthouseDunCow Fri Feb 20 19:29:43 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts But did you know I have a degree in Serbo-Croat? Fri Feb 20 16:47:13 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts @uxbridgewolf @fdwashbag I once knew a mediaeval Sorbian war song. #notinterestingbuttrue Fri Feb 20 16:46:33 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts @uxbridgewolf @fdwashbag Alright, I made it up. However Sorbs or Wends or Lusatians are a very small Slavic speaking nation. Fri Feb 20 16:44:35 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts Do they do Sorbian sorbet? That is not Serbian by the way. Fri Feb 20 13:47:24 GMT 2015
@balconyshirts They weren't there - they don't understand . Tue Feb 17 20:55:57 GMT 2015
@fifisyms what a bunch of pancake tossers! Tue Feb 17 15:00:53 GMT 2015

Watching Indian Summers on C4. Chiffchaffs singing in Simla in Summer? Is that likely? #justasking Sun Feb 15 21:39:58 GMT 2015

@pfoagain You should be rightly very proud of him. Thu Feb 12 19:47:11 GMT 2015
@GregHands Don't be too rude about QPR. They are the Chief Whip's team! However spot on about the benches emptying.... Wed Feb 11 12:30:11 GMT 2015
@AnneMiltonMP Have a well deserved cup of cocoa when you get in. More excitement tomorrow. Tue Feb 10 21:28:42 GMT 2015
@fifisyms Not in my day. Tue Feb 10 21:20:03 GMT 2015
@AnneMiltonMP I have a seat on the good old @metline. One of the many benefits of living in Uxbridge. #middlesexRiviera Tue Feb 10 21:19:34 GMT 2015

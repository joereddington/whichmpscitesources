Non League Football Parliamentary Debate: Alas as a DCMS PPS I can't speak, but will be in the chamber proudly wearing my @SupermarineFC tie
Preparing speech for @pupaid Parliamentary debate. We MUST end the free-for-all of mass breeding for profit with scant regard for welfare
Well... @england a win is win, just. I cant see Roy unleashing our huge potential, I'd go for Martinez with Hoddle (experience) as Assistant
Speech & votes done, now mad dash to Wembley for @england  - Huge potential in our squad but can Roy deliver, I am not sure... #engvnor

6-0... We just need Roy Hodgson to reassure us we are building for the future... #goalsaplenty
So 5-0 down at half-time... Quick check amongst the away fans to see who fancies a run out in the 2nd half #ohgoonthen
Right 4-3 fightbacks are so yesterday... Let's go for a 5-4 win #fournildownbooooo
In a bid to drive up supporter levels, entertaining @SupermarineFC have gifted the opposition a 3 goal headstart - 2nd 4-3 to follow?

@Swinbart - I know, but it should be the EA not SBC who pick up the pieces (financial) if there are issues.  They granted the licence.
Averies Waste Fire. The EA should be paying to transfer to Hills immediately. They issued the licence, buck stops with them, no excuses. 2/2
Averies Waste Fire. I am at an absolute loss as to why SBC should be picking up the pieces, either financially or alternative sites. 1/2

We do not know what the costs are yet on the environmental damage on #hs2 say Natural England & Environment Agency
#hs2 is destroying quite a lot of ancient woodland says Woodland Trust
Witnesses say HS2 will not reveal details behind refusing tunnel extension in the Chilterns which would save ancient woodland & environment
#HS2 have failed even to assess environmental damage in some areas and witnesses quite damning of the process

@OAH6thform am calling on Minister @JBrokenshire to rescind decision to remove which has been pre-determined by HO officials not Minister
@OAH6thform Insensitive unnecessary  wrong to give flight tickets before even Minister @JBrokenshire has agreed to remove! #FightForYashika
@OAH6thform Out of order and wrong that decision appears to have been made by Home Office before Minister decision #FightForYashika
@OAH6thform Have not heard officially from Home Office and continue to chase in #FightForYashika
@LoveUrdoorstep nice!
@nataliecvincent @OAH6thform as individual case PM would have referred to Home Office who need to respond asap #FightForYashika

@shamir_patel Home Office
@PSbook Can't shout down the facts #LongTermEconomicPlan last year provided 87% new jobs for UK workers -actions speak louder than...words!

@OAH6thform #fightforyashika continues..still waiting for response to my representations from Minister @JBrokenshire
@OAH6thform #FightForYashika continues because BA refused to take her on plane and Minister still to consider my reps so decision delayed
@OAH6thform Yes of course and received confirmation that reps are being considered by Minister. Now waiting for Home Office response..
@bexbeach yep and will follow up with @EnfieldCouncil

Agree with my colleague @nickdebois This is a Conservative led Government and we should not be afraid to say so.
Due on Radio Leicester after 9.30 to discuss benefit cap
Perhaps Lord Ashdown would like to explain why he believes a £500 a week benefit cap is wrong to hard working families in NW Leics.
Diane Abbott seems to have stopped tweeting Yougov Voting Intention poll findings!!
Interesting surgery today, the range of issues never fails to amaze me.
My complaint to Parli Standards about Jack Dromey is upheld. It is right that his serious misconduct has been investigated and condemned.
@CllrLeonSpence We are in agreement on that
@CllrLeonSpence Most of the problems have been exacerbated by Labour's Compensation Act of 2006. You were in power for 13 years remember.
@BBCEleanorG @parsons_david - and it was a pleasure to meet with him. Leics MP's are committed to lobby for a fair deal for the county.
Labour talk about how they would be creating jobs now, forgetting they are the party that has always left office with higher umemployment!!!
Ed Miliband says Labour need to be fiscally credible yet offers no change to his stop all cuts message. Words not action!!
@CllrLeonSpence We've gone through this before, difficult decisions need to be made and we are doing it in the fairest way.
@CllrLeonSpence Check the Autumn statement
@CllrLeonSpence I think we'll have to disagree about that. Things would be dire with the higher interest rates that plan would produce.
@CllrLeonSpence Sometime never it sounds like to me. Witness what has just happened France's credit rating. Plenty to debate come 2015
@CllrLeonSpence Do you accept the need for spending reductions Leon?
I wonder if Ed Balls u turn on spending might be coming too far and too fast for his colleagues and the unions.
So Ed Balls now accepts cuts. What has the last 18 months of protest at every single spending reduction been about then?
Meetings today with Voluntary Action Leicestershire and the Local Enterprise Partnership, focus on getting business growth in NW Leics

@CllrLeonSpence Seeing as we buy more from the EU than we sell, that would be a brave move by them. Norway and co don't seem worried
@CllrLeonSpence Do you think David Cameron was wrong to use the veto to protect British interests?
Clegg and co, wrong about the euro, wrong about the veto, out of touch with the public.
Pleased that the Prime Minister put Britian's interests first in Europe. A stark contrast to summits under Blair and Brown.
It appears that the former Labour Government spent nearly £5million preparing to join the Euro. http://t.co/AXML6aoQ

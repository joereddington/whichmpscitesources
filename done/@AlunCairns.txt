@RichardMMilne @BRORADIO @nathanspackman Thanks to you guys for your support.  Great evening.
Had a great evening celebrating 5 years of @BRORADIO thanks to all those involved & for your work over that time.
Yes. That is what the rules say. I am v sorry. A
That is Swansea West. Geraint Davies is your MP. He is a good guy. Parl protocol prevents me from acting a
I suggest that you contact your MP and ask him to pursue it.
@BBCwaste @daily_politics That is very kind. A
Surely prosecutors have questions to answer in Nigel Evans case, after Roach & Le Vell

@themikeknowles @BarryTownUnited @BRORADIO @BarryTownSC @StandUpForBarry Fantastuc result. Completely confident hat we will stay there now.
@fmwales is simply wrong to say DoH answered FOI in 1 day on delayed soldiers treatment in Wales.Why doesn't he ask the journalists?
Last min run for #vlm2014 with colleagues. Pls consider donating to @mariecurieuk by texting ALUN64 & amount to 70070 http://t.co/4ABh0VNoEW
So telling that @WelshGovernment focus on release of info rather than issue of Soldiers in Wales waiting longer for NHS treatment.It was FOI
@FGW but you didn't have what I wanted -decaf tea! The assistant was polite and professional. I don't blame him but do think policy is silly
Just paid £1.85 for a cup of hot water on @FGW Had to buy a decaf coffee without coffee.He couldn't sell or give me hot water #FGWjobsworth
@WelshGovernment defence of soldiers' delayed NHS Ops in Wales should consider that criticism has come from Surgeon General not a politician
This is scandalous. Surgeon General of Armed Forces concerned about Welsh NHS waiting & impact on military ops http://t.co/rzcwFvh7Ym

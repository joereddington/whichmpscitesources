@david_cameron stop banging on about Europe!
Right wing press claim Cameron has united party. But pro Europe Tories are so silent. Has Ken been gagged?
The more Tories bang on about Europe the less voters think they care about jobs, schools, hospitals and awful struggle many are having
Germany, France, Italy Spain amongst 11 EU countries to implement Robin Hood Tax UK should too raises £8 billion see my http://t.co/DHqPweKH
Miners deaths prosecution will enable the truth to be revealed http://t.co/hQw5ihUF

@paulwaugh see my question to Foreign Minister on Mali on Monday
@Ed_Miliband reduces PM to helpless floundering on Europe #PMQs Tories bitterly divided PM weak and economy damaged by years of uncertainty
@christinalamb congratulations on your honour well deserved
Happy 30th birthday Labour's brilliant chief press officer in the Welsh assembly @MatthewAplin
Excellent articles in @TheTimes by Sylvester and Thomson on Tory Minister civil service alienation - lifts lid on dysfunctional government.
Welsh Govt Minister Huw Lewis is right to argue Tory Lib Dem benefits changes are 'a social atrocity'  http://t.co/SQ8WzsGw
@mallos1 no my wife is NOT a director stop the lies and smears and stick to decent argument if you oppose the Severn Barrage
@Ed_Miliband commanding on Marr programme ludicrous to expect detailed Labour tax and spend now: no idea scale of mess we will inherit 2015
Severn Barrage biggest renewable energy project by far plus 50K jobs Wales+SW England including thousands in Neath area why I'm supporting
Severn Barrage opponents and Plaid Cymru sectarians should stick to factual arguments not baseless personal smears
@Gillypedia nothing
Just challenged Hague in Commons on why he won't rule out UK military intervention in Syria civil war.
BBC Radio4 tonight Decision Time I'm on panel arguing for maintaining pensioner fuel allowance, free bus travel etc
Brilliant demolition job on Tory. Lib Dem benefits bill by  @dMiliband in parliament
@richt49 No I have NOT 'bought Tory strivers vs shirkers' story at all but important to nail their lie that only those home on benefits hit
@Chrisuk1943 @BrendaGunning So why did the Tories and Libs sign up to Labour Govt spending plans before the global banking crisis?
While millionaires get a tax cut, 7 million striving working families pay price for Cameron and Osborne’s economic failure
Majority facing benefit cuts are in work total hypocrisy by Tory Lib-Dems who have no idea how tough life is for low paid strivers targeted
Labour voting tonight against cuts of up to £1300 for 4.6m women, half working. Two thirds hit by tax credit and benefit cuts are women
@oflynnexpress @richarevans1 Patrick you come off it: you keep changing your tune!  Remember also: I voted against Maastricht Bill in 1992-3
@oflynnexpress @richarevans1 stop spinning Patrick! You left out from my quotes subject to Gordon Brown's 5 economic tests
@richarevans1 @oflynnexpress no I never said that as always Europhobes distort and their media hacks spin furiously
@oflynnexpress @PeterHain @guardian I actually said Euro could be in UK interest and case for it; nobody suggests joining now
@oflynnexpress @guardian I never said 'we had to join the Euro' but that we should never rule it out for dogmatic reasons
Great piece by Peter Mandelson in @Guardian today on reactionary perils of PM posturing on Europe: dangerous for future of UK + also Europe
Study shows Swansea City first year in football Premiership worth £58 million to local economy. Keep flying the Swans @SwansOfficial
Lib Dems out-righting even Tories on cutting winter fuel allowance etc. Expensive and punitive means-testing. Also saves peanuts
@Disillusioned__  have been @chelseafc fan since 1965 so cut the fake cynicism which is usually pseudonym for rightist politics
SuperFrank two goals @chelseafc he MUST stay sign him up Roman
Cameron strategy with Tory anti-Europeans pushing him means UK could exit EU by default if not design
Former Head of Foreign Office John Kerr absolutely right Cameron heading for Europe 'bust up'
At least 15000 families dependant upon Foodbanks for Christmas indictment of Tory-Lib Dem austerity failure

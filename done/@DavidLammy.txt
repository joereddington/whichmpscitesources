Extending Right to Buy might make good headlines but it's awful policy. Read my piece in The @Independent: http://t.co/6BElzBOREo Thu Apr 16 10:57:40 BST 2015
The Tories' Right to Buy extension isn't just awful policy - it's also a £12 billion hole in their spending plans.  http://t.co/v6jenpo4Lk Wed Apr 15 17:53:32 BST 2015
Very good analysis of Tories Right to Buy extension from Joe Sarling - http://t.co/v6jenp6tTM Wed Apr 15 17:19:30 BST 2015

Tories don't seem to get housing crisis will be solved by increasing supply, not constantly increasing demand. Only @UKLabour will do that. Tue Apr 14 13:01:38 BST 2015
Having a "home ownership" policy isn't worth the paper it is written on unless it has a plan to build new homes at its heart. Tue Apr 14 10:15:04 BST 2015
@Widerife81 Reducing supply while demand stays the same/increases drives up prices, hitting potential first time buyers hardest. Tue Apr 14 10:03:18 BST 2015
Tory Right to Buy pits prospects of one type of tenant against another. Labour house building boosts everyone. Tue Apr 14 08:54:42 BST 2015

National security too important to play politics with says Fallon as he, er, holds press conference playing politics over national security. Thu Apr 09 10:37:47 BST 2015
When we desperately need new social homes, new schools, more doctors and nurses, £100 billion on bombs could be much better spent elsewhere. Thu Apr 09 09:19:41 BST 2015

If you read into what they're refusing to rule out, Tories want to fund tax cut for richest few by taxing disability benefits. Astonishing. Mon Apr 06 21:47:41 BST 2015
Agree with @rickedwards1 on compulsory voting but don't think it should only apply to young voters. Issue is how to enforce it effectively. Mon Apr 06 17:44:26 BST 2015

@woeykitt It would be a more reasonable point if build to rent was common but it isn't. That's what I mean about properties already existing Thu Mar 19 23:54:54 GMT 2015
@tomwilson23 @IainDale Precisely. Thu Mar 19 23:52:34 GMT 2015
@IainDale And I agree that's a failure of both parties. But original policy should've mandated replacement. Thu Mar 19 23:52:00 GMT 2015
@IainDale 270,000 council homes lost in London since introduction of Right to Buy in 1980. Homes sold should've been replaced but weren't. Thu Mar 19 23:51:20 GMT 2015
@woeykitt Lack of demand for homes is not the reason we aren't building! Plus very few homes built specifically for rent. Thu Mar 19 23:47:13 GMT 2015
@IainDale But many thousands more lost for good under Right to Buy. Huge mistake not to mandate like for like replacement of every one sold. Thu Mar 19 23:45:43 GMT 2015
Now Javid attacks Labour for loss of council homes. Er which party introduced Right to Buy without replacing millions of council homes lost? Thu Mar 19 23:38:16 GMT 2015
Javid argument only works if private rented properties are mostly new builds. Vast majority aren't. #rentcontrols #bbcqt Thu Mar 19 23:34:40 GMT 2015

@chappers06 That's 'affordable' housing which is often anything but. It replaced social housing but we need to build new council homes Tue Feb 24 23:46:28 GMT 2015
10) Encourage the development of Community Land Trusts to ensure that land is developed according to the needs of local people. Tue Feb 24 23:42:39 GMT 2015
9) Expand the GLA planning department so it can oversee new home building in line with the London Plan, and support council planning dept's. Tue Feb 24 23:41:07 GMT 2015
8) Implement a 'Help to Build' loan scheme to support smaller developers. Also allow them to bid for land though London Development Panel. Tue Feb 24 23:38:59 GMT 2015
7) Push the Treasury to add new council tax bands for the most expensive properties in order to fund building of new council houses. Tue Feb 24 23:37:19 GMT 2015
6) Incentivise developers to build a mass of new shared ownership properties to help first time buyers get a foot on the housing ladder. Tue Feb 24 23:35:49 GMT 2015
5) Introduce system of rent controls to protect tenants from unfair rent rises. Move to 3 year tenancies & compulsory landlord registration. Tue Feb 24 23:34:41 GMT 2015
4) Tighten regulation around Right to Buy to stop so many council homes being sold into private sector. 270,000 lost in London since 1980. Tue Feb 24 23:30:27 GMT 2015
3) Redefine 'affordable housing' so it actually means affordable, linking it to average wages in each area and capping at 60% OMV not 80%. Tue Feb 24 23:24:39 GMT 2015
2) Revisit a 70 year old greenbelt system that protects wasteland and car parks in Outer London but not parks/playing fields in Inner London Tue Feb 24 23:22:31 GMT 2015
1. Lift borrowing cap on local councils to enable them to build a new generation of council homes. Just 40 were built in London last year. Tue Feb 24 23:20:19 GMT 2015

@ThatTimFramp There are pay scales but currently drivers driving same route are paid different wage. All depends which company employs them. Thu Feb 05 11:34:16 GMT 2015
Disturbed by news that anti-Semitic incidents at record high. No place for complacency in the fight against prejudice http://t.co/SLZsl8M79r Thu Feb 05 11:11:55 GMT 2015
TfL should find a way to ensure bus drivers in London are paid equally across the city. It's a basic issue of fairness. #BusStrike Thu Feb 05 10:53:08 GMT 2015

She has a huge amount still to offer our country - her energy & drive are a major asset to Barking & Dagenham, @UKLabour & Parliament. (2/2) Wed Feb 04 17:51:43 GMT 2015
.@margarethodge is a great friend, a ferocious campaigner and would have been a formidable mayoral candidate.

Tory affordable housing policy in tatters. Ordinary Londoners bearing the brunt of their shambles. Deserve better. http://t.co/51Irb7fdFu Mon Feb 02 23:01:51 GMT 2015

@sashtag I've said we should link 'affordable' rents to local earnings, and cap at 60% of market value, so they're actually affordable (2/2) Mon Feb 02 13:12:17 GMT 2015
@sashtag Yes, affordable housing quotas must be enforced. But also need to redefine 'affordable' so it's genuinely affordable for Londoners. Mon Feb 02 13:10:52 GMT 2015
@JewishNewsUK @HackneyAbbott Sickening. This kind of hatred and prejudice has no place in the London I know and love. Mon Feb 02 12:57:34 GMT 2015
Appalling anti-Semitic march planned on London's streets. No place for this in our city, which thrives on tolerance.
http://t.co/rlQWStM2FS Mon Feb 02 12:38:25 GMT 2015
Why is govt. making it even easier for developers to build fewer affordable homes? Total failure on housing policy. http://t.co/3xvZ6GYlG6 Mon Feb 02 12:26:03 GMT 2015

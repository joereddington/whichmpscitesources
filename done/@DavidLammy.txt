@JosephLCox Thank you
On ITV London Tonight in 5 mins talking about London education, pupils' successes and why we should be even more ambitious for our schools.
Looking forward to a few busy days on the #labourdoorstep in #Tottenham (and for @CatherineWest1) please get in touch for details.
Great to speak at @gooddayatwork conference on the importance of wellbeing and mental health, and what employers can do to promote it.
@sirsuj Thanks. V kind.
@mike_reader @votegarvie Thanks. V kind.
Brilliant piece by @pollytoynbee on human costs of council housing shortage. Must look at new limits on Right to Buy. http://t.co/A5ROHJIgvm

Big thanks to Labour friends in Wellingborough and @votegarvie. Great Evening. Let's fight for the council and get rid of Peter Bone.
@MogsyMorg @HuffPostUKPol Thanks Gareth
@TottenhamTories 5 more years of Tory government would be a complete disaster for constituencies like Tottenham and everyone knows it.

Good meeting just now on how we can keep pushing the Government to give the West Anglia Main Line the investment it needs.
@CCHQPress @Ed_Miliband Hardly! You wish.
@nick2ned Thank you - appreciate it. If interested you can sign up for updates at  http://t.co/akesRoKUT3
@nick2ned I've proposed linking the criteria for affordable rents to average local earnings, and capping it at 60% of market value.
And let's not forget that the Mayor moving the goalposts on affordable housing has priced thousands of low-paid Londoners out of their homes
An 'affordable' home in Barnet could cost £2100 a month. Sign here if you agree that's not affordable.

@crispymick Yes. I've already asked for my name to be added but it takes a day or two to update the list.
Very disappointed that @networkrail report on West Anglia Main Line doesn't include commitment to four-tracking. Serious missed opportunity.
@Biggsy58 Thanks Bernie. Enjoyed it.
@SeemaChandwani Thanks. V kind .

Answering my parliamentary Q, Govt admits it "has made no assessment of new river crossings on the economy of East London". Maybe it should!
@caitlin_sc All should, but it's more difficult for small businesses than huge football clubs already spending many millions on wages.
My colleague @frankfieldteam already running an excellent campaign on this.
@Joe_Dromey Agree with that Joe. If you can afford to pay a striker £15,000 a week you can afford to play a cleaner £9.15 an hour.
@KarlTurnerMP Thanks v much Karl. Much appreciated.
Had response from Foreign Office Minister to my parliamentary question on Kobane. Confirms UK "ready to respond" to help civilians. Good.
Pleased to hear government minister back my calls for Premier League football clubs to pay staff Living Wage. Inexcusable that they dont.
@KarlTurnerMP Ta.
@JackDromeyMP giving brilliant speech spelling out the human side of fair pay and the real difference Living Wage makes.
@peterc45 @UKPatchwork @UKLabour @JonathanHolt15 @KPMG Thanks. V kind.
In the Chamber waiting to speak in debate on Living Wage. Disappointing turnout on such an important issue. London worst for income poverty.
Pleased that @londonchamber #skillsgap report includes rec. to fund careers advice from Year 7. Senseless that Coalition scrapped it.
London as global city = Londoners are competing for jobs with workers around the world. Must ensure our training & learning is world's best.
Very important report published by @londonchamber this morning on #skillsgap in construction. Must improve London training & skills market.

Fair pay shouldn't be optional - it's a basic issue of justice. Important that London has own minimum wage to reflect higher living costs.
V pleased to see London Living Wage raised to £9.15-an-hour. Now to get more employers paying it and also introduce a London Minimum Wage.

Thanks to all who joined my #threetodecide campaign to keep London primary fee low. Great to see NEC recognising need to make it accessible.

Pleased that Mike Read's asked for UKIP calypso to be withdrawn. Clearly realises there's no place for that kind of politics in 2014 Britain
Also good to see some concrete proposals for implementing this. Government should set the ball rolling immediately. #CitiesGrowthCommission

@tomcopley very good on @LBC just now on how Boris has shifted goalposts on affordable housing and still doesn't get why it's an issue.
@KerryPollard_ I've proposed linking affordable rents to average earnings. 60% market value would be upper limit. See http://t.co/uHZGJyydzw
#MountPleasant shows huge problems caused by Boris' decision to allowed "affordable" rents to be up to 80% OMV. Next mayor must lower to 60%

Fantastic speech by Bill de Blasio - a call for action on inequality, honesty and bold leadership. Many shared problems facing NY & London.
@mralibi That's what I suggested in my housing report: http://t.co/uHZGJyydzw
@vincegraff @toryboypierce @ComingUpTheHill @jowellt @HackneyAbbott That's what I suggested in my book and here: http://t.co/uHZGJyydzw
@BelindaBG @andyburnhammp @SadiqKhan @jowellt @HackneyAbbott  Away from Westminster/Whitehall, yes. To regions and cities, including London.
Idea of taxing homes of the wealthy more is spot on. But must include exemptions for cash-poor, asset-rich London pensioners.
Big Q on mansion tax is how it'll be calculated. If on current value then London pensioners living in same home for years will be hit hard.
@kbrad1111 Yes. I've proposed investing it in new council homes for local people.
Really pleased to hear London colleagues tonight endorsing my proposals for more council tax bands on richest homeowners.
Great to join @demos & @londonchamber to discuss and debate big London issues with friends and colleagues at #Lab14 http://t.co/lgHrnWsEVE
Great speech outlining clear plan. Only a year ago people said we were short of policy. Now more than all other parties combined. #lab14
Votes for 16 year olds a long time in coming. I've often called for this. Great to hear it confirmed as party policy. #Lab14
Commitment on housing spot on. Achieving it will mean removing brakes on local councils & building thousands of new council homes. #Lab14
As I said yday, we won't have succeeded on further education until middle class parents see vocational courses on par with academic ones.
Delighted to see Ed promise on apprenticeships. As a Minister I pledged half a million new apprenticeships but Coalition hasn't followed up.
Ed right to promise focus on green economy. Creating jobs and boosting growth means investing in industries apart from service sector #Lab14
Ed emphasises Labour promise on minimum wage. Will help 2 million. Hope final manifesto will also include pledge to look at London min wage.
@hazmatt72 @UKLabour Nothing wealthy about the one in four Londoners living below the poverty line. They deserve to be paid a fair wage.
Great to join @billyhayes_cwu and the #CWU at their reception at #Lab14. http://t.co/NJj0viVYNH

Politics to one side got to admire Alex Salmond gutsy authentic style of leadership.Clearly has a place in Scotland's Pantheon of great sons
But must be applied equally & consistently. Giving 1 region greater autonomy while depriving others (London) of it is no long-term solution.
That 45% of Scots felt they'd be better off outside the UK is a real wake up call. Must now devolve power to regions across the country.
A historic day in which Scotland affirmed its belief in unity and co-operation over division and separation. Now time to fix the divides.

@CandourCollab Big difference is devolving power to local authorities rather than doing it top-down
@TabbyKinder Considering it, yes
Boris Johnson is already a part-time mayor, now will be even more of one. Always cared more about his ambitions than #London's problems.

@davidrobbo66 Lots of organisations doing great work on this but underused. Why not utilise that? Esp. when Jobcentres so overstretched.
@davidrobbo66 It's about giving local authorities power to commission organisations already doing great work in this area, e.g. @CreativeSoc
@patrickjbutler Key differences to Work Programme, e.g. more powers to local authorities. See my original speech: http://t.co/7DTibNQwJb.
It's time to make Jobcentres redundant. Let's scrap them and replace them with proper support for the unemployed.

Closing down a sports centre, deliberating over maintenance & reducing funding is no way to increase participation in sport in West Lancs
West Lancashire Borough Council should not hide behind figures and instead get on with increasing participation in local sport.
Welcomed the Minister’s agreement that WLBC should use the Olympics to drive up participation in sport across West Lancashire.
@matt855617 Hi Matthew, could you email me details to rosie@rosiecooper.net & I’ll take up your concerns with Lancs County Council?
Wigan AFC should come clean about their academy plans at their press conference at 4pm today. @richaskam @GranadaReports
Unfair Wrightington residents left with uncertainty. They deserve to have an answer on whether plans are on hold today.
I wrote to the club in mid-May asking if they intended to pursue plans to build training academy at Wrightington. No answer yet!
Asked Wigan AFC to confirm @richaskam tweet that academy plans are on hold. Club said they’re not making any public statements.

Action needs to be taken to deal with planning issues before WLancs residents completely lose faith in the process. http://t.co/vH6DHtjwYU
It appears WLBC’s Planning Dept is in chaos yet again. I’ve called upon the Planning Inspectorate to investigate the shambles.
I welcome LCC’s commitment to install a crossing on Derby St but fear it may just be another empty promise. http://t.co/EbXzYedOTk

After this answer I have to ask when is a rule not a rule... when Esther McVey is in charge?
Minister said issue will be looked at case by case. Doesn’t mention this in new regulations!
Not sure Gov u’stand huge cost of this. All cars have to be adapted for each person.  Ppl can reapply for a new car once out of hospital
Asked DWP Minister about new regulations that will take away disabled ppl’s motability cars after 4 weeks if in hospital

Sandy Lane parking should be free for everyone, not just for West Lancs BC and their staff members.

I asked the Local Govt Sec to ensure Cllrs duty to tax payers isn’t hindered by “commercial confidentiality".
Asked Q in Parliament about secrecy surrounding companies like One Connect – that rely on public money yet refuse to answer how they use it.
@sara_not_sarah Hi Sara, thanks, I will be represented at meeting as I'm in Parliament but will continue to work with W-RAGE.
@TriathlonAnge Hi, I’ve been working with W-RAGE to ensure voices are heard. All WLancs residents welcome to sign petition.
It’s time for Lancs CC to stick to their promise & provide residents with protection they deserve. Council must enforce the rules they set!

Report highlights why work of groups such as APPG on Obesity is so vital. We need action not just rhetoric on key health issues
Report published by Lancet yday says UK is ‘lagging behind’ on health issues – 30,000 lives per year could be saved if UK performed better.
@WLancsGP I've signed EDM 1104 & have written to Lord Goodlad of Lords Scrutiny Committee to raise concerns on this matter.

Not surprised then that the Minister that ignored my questions. Think this tells us all we need to know about the credibility of his claims.
Only problem is NAO said it ‘couldn’t offer a definitive view on affordability.
Defence Sec staked his credibility of balancing defence budget and  affordability of equipment plans on review by National Audit Office
Challenged Defence Secretary over his plans for the defence budget post-2015 at Questions today in Commons
Great visit this morning to St Mary’s Catholic Primary, Scarisbrick, talking with pupils about politics & their trip to Parliament in June.
I am sure the Planning Inspector respon. for examining the Local Plan will be listening to the strong concerns of local residents.
4016 name petition, 96% vote in the Parish Poll all signs of strong opposition to Yew Tree Farm plans.
Residents don’t feel WLBC listening to their concerns….so important to use other avenues to make those voices heard.
Tonight I presented Burscough Action Group’s petition opposing the Yew Tree Farm plans in the House of Commons.
Any local bands interested in 'Rock the House' 2013 should visit http://t.co/xWaVLZEZ for more info. Look forward to hearing entries!

Believe that we need a full investigation to assess how deep and wide blacklisting actually was.
@TopMarksTutors Happy to help. Please send me an email on rosie@rosiecooper.net or call my office on 01695 570094.
Activities of Consultation Association are just a snapshot of the extent to which blacklisting has been happening in the UK
Important debate today on blacklisting practices that deprived people of the livelihoods by stopping them from getting jobs.
Bedroom tax is unfair when Council’s are offering houses too big. Families forced to pay extra or remain homeless as they’ve no choice.
Gov’t’s approach on the bedroom tax is completely flawed....it won’t  work in terms of creating mobility within the social rented sector
Bedroom tax is just more cost-cutting and budget-slashing from the Con-led Gov’t whatever else they may say.
How shameful that there was not a single Conservative or Lib Dem MP in this debate on the bedroom tax.
Collective single raised thousands to help Hillsborough families with legal fees. It's right those profits are safeguarded. #JFT96

You can read my full statement about this decision here http://t.co/UkjeLohz
Staff at WL Health Centre are doing a great job even in difficult times for the NHS.  We need to protect not cut services
Since it opened in 2009 WL Health Centre been a great success... I encourage residents to keep using this great service
Wanted to look these people in the eye and let them know closing services shouldn’t be an easy decision or one taken lightly
Disappointed people making decisions are not from and don’t know West Lancs...made this point at the meeting
Attended PCT Board meeting where it was decided to close GP Registered  list at WL Health Centre but delighted the Centre remains open

Thank you to everyone who donated. This will go a long way to helping so many people.
Tesco have contacted me following national food collection day at Burscough Bridge. Enough food collected for 3093 meals.
This shows how cutting budgets is not always the best or only way to save money in the public sector! Let’s see if the DH is listening
Pilot studies show for every £1 invested you can save £8 for the NHS through effective multi-disciplinary foot treatment for diabetics
Yet 80% of these 6000 amputations are preventable with good foot care services.  This is why diabetics need good podiatry services.
6000 diabetic people per yr have leg, toe or foot amputations due to foot ulcers.  #diabetes #podiatry
Excellent debate on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diabetes this morning #diabetes #podiatry
Theory of LCP is reasonable...problem is it’s failing in practice in too many cases. Don’t need anthr Mid-Staffs situation hitting the NHS
Don’t u’stand why hospitals need financial incentive to put people of LCP – it is either right or wrong for the patient!
When 57,000 ppl are dying each yr not knowing they’ve been placed on LCP.  Time to take a look at how this system works
Spoke in the L’pool Care Pathway debate today over serious concerns that it is moving away from end of life care as initially intended
Hopefully new inquiry will ask questions of the FA and its decisions on choosing Hillsborough in 1989!  #jft96
Lord Judges comments on the ‘deliberate misinformation surrounding the disaster’ says it all #jft96
Another momentous day in the walk towards justice for the 96. New inquests ordered and a new police inquiry. #jft96
It's amazing how agencies seem to turn their back when people need them most!It was WLBC's turn earlier this week with their flooding report
This latest incident just shows how we need to keep fighting for a better deal for residents when it comes to flooding.
Called Lancashire County Council and Lancashire Police only for them to play pass the parcel.  Not us guv!
Seems that despite all the talk no-one has learnt any lessons when it comes to tackling flooding in West Lancashire.
Alty’s Lane is once again looking like a lake as water pours off  fields & onto road. Except no one is willing to help and take respon’y.
If you want to add your name to Railway petition go to http://t.co/DYdqZIFH

Families have fought tirelessly for over 23 yrs for correct verdict; hopefully latest announcement is another step towards Justice. #JFT96

Great to see @LoveOrmskirk working to reinvigorate our local high street.
Plenty happening in Ormskirk Town Centre with European Markets, Ice Rink and kids’ rides. @LoveOrmskirk #LoveXmas
Think WLBC have some serious questions to answer over their practices.
All this money yet WLBC has closed Skem Sports Centre whilst Ormskirk Civic Hall & 5 Community Centres face closure.
Audit Commission report says Councils have £12.9 billion in reserves. Last fig I saw for WLBC they had £17m of this. http://t.co/VRFhac3L
Local Government Secretary has slammed Councils for level of reserves. Think he should take a look at WLBC.
Skelmersdale residents have waited long enough; it is time for developers to set deliverable timescales for Town Centre development.
I’m delighted that at long last, the planning application for Skelmersdale Town Centre has been approved - http://t.co/X3aIzYHi
Many residents told me they were delighted w help they got improving energy efficiency in their homes, training opps and looking for jobs

Thanks to all customers at Tesco Burscough for their donations for National Food Collection.  Will mean a great deal for many families.
Latest West Coast Mainline announcement gives Govt almost 2 years to finally sort out their franchise fiasco.
Delighted to hear passengers will now have some stability as Virgin Trains to run West Coast Mainline for next 23 months.
Excellent turnout for #CAID with orgs offering advice on energy, health, jobs, training and much much more.  Come Along!
Come along to my 2012 Community Advice & Information Day Fri 7 Dec @ 10am-2pm at Concourse Skelmersdale.  For more info http://t.co/KGvIbBRI
A new full investigation into police handling of Hillsborough is a vital part of process to finally achieve justice for the 96 victims.
The Police (Complaints and Conduct) Bill will mean that IPCC has powers to look into past investigations of police conduct.
Great to have cross-party support last night on Hillsborough Bill. Retired officers must not be able to hide from IPCC investigations.
You can sign @TheOKFoundation’s petition on the Govt epetitions' website http://t.co/P4qUoRIv
Great campaign by @TheOKFoundation to have defibrillators put into public buildings, it could help to save hundreds of lives.
Very pleased to support @TheOKFoundation’s visit to No 10 yesterday with @JakeLabour @steverotherammp & @lucianaberger http://t.co/4NrCPytt

@hottershoes have asked me to present a pair of their shoes to each of the Party Leaders as part of excellent #Lancashire Day event.
Let’s celebrate #LancashireDay! What is your favourite thing about Lancashire and in particular West Lancashire?
On this day in 1295 Lancashire sent its first representatives to Parliament. 717 years later here we are celebrating #LancashireDay
You can add you name to the petition at http://t.co/yVx506Ep
Added my name to petition opposing privatisation of Welfare Rights Advisory Service by Con-led Lancashire County Council.
Justice for cyclists demands that dangerous drivers be charged with dangerous not careless driving.
Made the point today that helmets are not the easy solution. We need laws to be applied fairly when cyclists hit due to dangerous driving.
We mustn't forget other cyclists like Christine Favager who was fatally injured cycling on WL roads due to dangerous driving.
Bradley Wiggins accident here in West Lancs has highlighted the need to improve road safety for cyclists.  Timely debate then this afternoon
Afternoon in Westminster Hall speaking in debates 1st on safety of cyclists then 2nd on mobile comms tech use in healthcare
PM also claimed N’hood Policing is increasing.  Not if you live in Burscough & Scarisbrick who now share a neighbourhood team
Police face cuts to frontline, attacks on their pensions and conditions of service.  Strange how the PM thinks this is supporting the police
PM in response to my Q. Says Gov’t strongly sppts our police service except 96% of police service disagree.
Yesterday I challenged Home Office Ministers about Government decision to spend £100m on #PCC elections. http://t.co/Tk5c8sZb
On Friday I welcomed Shadow Employment Minister @stephenctimms to WLancs to discuss employment challenges for the area http://t.co/kcxJw6or
Minister has agreed to write to explain details of grant applications so residents can get help to protect their home from flooding
Residents can get funding for prevention measures w sppt of Council from EA. Only no-one knows about it or how to make a claim for a grant.
Raised with Min. the fact there is still no affordable insurance deal between Gov’t and insurers following my question to the DPM.
Experience from Sept flooding is more investment in prevention measures and desperate need for more effective co-ordination.
Many areas will need support of Central Gov’t to help with costs to help with clean-up costs.  Challenge in WL is to be more proactive
Spoke in Westminster Hall Debate on implications of flooding for local government spending this morning
Telling that the Minister had no answer to explain why Gov’t chose to spend £100m on #PCC election instead of frontline policing.
Would like to see the Home Office team try to police huge areas like the whole of Scarisbrick (32 sq miles) and Burscough as a beat.
Lancs Police do a great job but they need a Home Office supporting not attacking them
Home Office Minister tells me crime is falling. So too are frontline police numbers.
Several West Lancs employers, @scottreesandco & @WLancsCollege joined @stephenctimms and me to discuss range of employment challenges.
Good mtg with Church leaders and @stephenctimms.  Concern that as Gov't deserts vulnerable, people are turning to Church 4 food & shelter
Thanks to @stephenctimms for visiting West Lancashire today to discuss employment issues and the role of faith in our communities.
1m women still subject to domestic violence every year. Prosecution rate is still too low. More needs to be done to protect victims.
Real privilege to Chair WLDVSS AGM today; because of org's like these the view of domestic violence has  changed and is no longer tolerated.
Delighted to join WL Domestic Violence Support Service to celebrate 25 years of their work in protecting victims of domestic violence.
After promising to rethink #CICScuts Gov't left them unchanged. Now cuts will take place from Tuesday 27 November. @UsdawMedia
Clear this Conservative-led Government's priorities are not in the interests of,or shared by,West Lancashire residents. #fuelduty #CICScuts
I asked DPM about flooding insurance deal promised for July and was told constituents can wait.  Yet #CICScuts in 2 weeks!  Priorities.
Conservative-led Government so desperate to slash support for victims of crime new laws will take effect in 2 weeks. #CICScuts @UsdawMedia
Shameful how Tories cuts to criminal injuries compensation scheme which is an attack on innocent victims of crime. #CICScuts @UsdawMedia
Putting another 3p on fuel prices only puts more pressure on the economy and makes it more expensive to travel to work. #fuelduty
Tories voted against Labour motion to postpone fuel duty rise.  Incredible how they want to keep making it harder for hard working motorists
Unbelievable how many shopworkers are faced with violence and abuse.  Usdaw Freedom from Fear campaign has my full support @usdawmedia

Met with Network Rail to discuss action on flooding, esp. Railway Path in Ormskirk. http://t.co/i4PzbQyP
Unfortunately was not called to speak but @usdawmedia has my full backing against #CICScuts.
Gov't talks a good game as party of law and order yet has just committed a mugging on innocent victims of crime by slashing CICS @usdawmedia
Way Gov't has introduced Criminal Injuries Compensation legislation is an absolute outrage.  They should be ashamed. @usdawmedia #CICScuts
DoH support for regional pay in the NHS is nothing more than a race to the bottom. Another stake in the heart of a NATIONAL Health Service.
Gov't needs to understand that their broken promises have serious consequences for West Lancs constituents. #PMQs
Asked for assurances constituents won't continue to suffer due to Gov't inaction.  With risk of more floods this winter urgent action needed
Challenged DPM over Gov't failure to bring forward plans for a new deal on flood insurance promised by July.  It's now November! #PMQs
Had a Prime Ministers Question today and raised West Lancs flooding issues on how residents and farmers have been devastated #PMQs
Wonder if the knighthood will be next to go for Norman Bettison? #jft96
Seems it got too hot in the kitchen for Bettison after Monday's revelations during the Hillsborough debate.  There
is no hiding place.
It's good to see local fire services urging people to regularly test their smoke alarms. It could save your life. #TestItTuesday
As a Town Team Partner, I’m glad to offer my continued support to the Love Ormskirk team in their efforts to boost the town centre.

As I quoted in my speech, Gandhi said 'Truth never damages a cause that is just.  #jft96  is a just cause!
If your statement wasn't included in the evidence given to the Hillsborough Independent Panel, let me know.  Govt says it will investigate.
It was good to hear that the FA will be included within the scope of the investigation.
Want to thank Damian Kavanagh for all his work on Hillsborough and for keeping up the fight!
No. of WLancs residents at Hillsborough tragedy.They've waited 23 years to get these questions raised.  Now let's see what answers come back
Pleased to get called in debate on Hillsborough Report to give my West Lancs constituents a voice with their issues and questions.
So that's thanks to @EnvAgencyNW; @unitedutilities; @ElectricityNW; @NFUNorthWest; @lancspolice; @LancsFRS; @westlancsbc; @WWTMartinMere
Pity Lancs Cnty Council couldn't be bothered to come to flooding forum.  Thanks to other agencies who showed  they cared about West Lancs
Disgusted by how Lancs Cnty Cnl treat West Lancs with contempt by withdrawing officer from the flooding forum meeting at 24 hrs notice.
It's clear from emails and letters I got ahead of today's flooding forum mtg that more could've and should've been done for residents.
Today's Flooding Forum meeting with range of agencies was a positive start post-flooding.  Long road ahead to deliver solutions.
Gov's way out on West Coast Mainline could end up making the situation worse.  oh dear!
Heading to the Chamber for Ministers statement on West Coast Mainline - Gov has turned this into a right old fiasco! #WCML
Understand that the wreaths have now been removed from the former war memorial site.  Shame they didn't care enough to do it in 1st place.
Horrified by the disgraceful way wreaths strewn at Comrades site after war memorial moved - http://t.co/2CmOZpgU
This drop-in is just a start in clearing up the problems but the message is clear people want solutions so this doesn't happen again & again
From speaking to residents today it is clear if WLBC and LCC had an emergency plan to help residents hit by flooding it failed!

Congrats to @rsmck for starting the petition that raised awareness of West Coast Mainline fiasco and helped trigger Govt rethink.
Gov needs to ensure this fiasco doesn't carry on and hit rail passengers relying on West Coast Mainline
There are even more questions that they need to answer over this fiasco, including the ones they ducked in the debate
Gov climbs down over the West Coast Mainline decision....they took their time.

For more info on Burscough Parish Poll card and polling stations – http://t.co/JaWANRcu
No polling cards are being issued for Burscough Parish Poll today.  Just go along & vote 4pm to 9pm at your usual polling station.
We now await the judicial review.  Ministers won’t be able to hide behind this next time we come to ask questions.
Derek Twigg (Halton) asked some very probing questions of Minister, esp. on GDP projections
Don’t understand why Ministers think that repeating the benefits of the FirstGroup Bid will stop all the questions about the process.
I’m sure many will share my frustration at lack of answers still in West Coast Mainline.
Disappointed the Minister didn’t answer the questions that go right to the heart of the West Coast Mainline debate!
@rsmck thanks for your kind words.  Think it is you who deserves thanks for giving 170,000 a voice today.
Time has come for Transport Ministers to answer MPs questions over West Coast Mainline Franchise.
Good 7am interview on West Coast Mainline on Beswick at Breakfast.   This afternoon we will finally get to hear from Transport Ministers.

A time to remember those who lost their lives and those who dedicated their lives to the fight for justice

This recession, made in Downing Street, just keeps getting deeper and deeper and deeper...
Economy shrunk 0.7% and we're now in worst double-dip recesion for 50 years! When will Government accept it's on the wrong track?
@Dannnysfury Send me a DM or email (rosie@rosiecooper.net) with your address and I will write further
.@Dannnysfury The Council has consistently refused to invest any significant money for the long-term
.@Dannnysfury It's an absolute disgrace that Conservative-run Borough Council has taken the decision to close Skelmersdale Sports Centre
Hi, @patterson_jen. You can find South and West Lancashire Food Bank at Unit 10/11 Westgate, Skelmersdale. Thanks for your support.

Last year 271m portions of milk were funded for under-5s. At a time when poverty increasing, it would be wrong to take away this provision.
Shameful that Gov. are even thinking of scrapping @milkforkids. Typical of Cameron's Conservatives!

Pleased to add my name @HazelBlearsMP's EDM opposing cuts to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. #USDAW
Congratulations to Skem North JFC for securing £5000 from @FootballFoundtn to help start new teams!
Usdaw’s John Hannett is right - the Conservatives are, once again, making the most vulnerable pay.
Usdaw is right to point out these workers will lose twice – no compensation and lost pay having to take time off work...
Government cuts to injury compensation is another attack on the 11,000 shopworkers attacked each year.
Just met up with the @EnvAgencyNW to catch-up about their work here in West Lancashire. http://t.co/kuIgpThh
A big thank you to @StephenTwigg for taking the time to visit West Lancs today.
Great discussion and Q&A with staff and pupils from across West Lancashire at Ormskirk School. Lots to think about!
Great debate going on around the table about the future education policy in this country.
At Ormskirk School with @StephenTwigg and local headteachers for a roundtable discussion on education this morning.
Clear from my casework that we need a solution on social care now... People can’t afford to wait any longer.
Nice to see Dilnot Inquiry has been turned into a waste of time by the Health Secretary
Likely to be 2 more years until any final decision is made on the future of social care.
Social care is one of biggest challenges facing us as a society.  Today Lansley kicked it even further into the long grass.
Gov has dropped its Programme Motion on length of time for Lords Reform Bill debate.First signs of Gov backtracking? Embarrassing for Clegg!
Nick Clegg says public is 'nonplussed'. How do you know if you don't ask them?
Coalition inconsistent which issues & when Britsh public shld have their say in a referendum–new voting system,Europe,CityMayors,LordsReform
Yesterday Clegg said it's time to trust the British people.  Seems not enough trust to ask their view on Lords Reform – no referendum.
Question to Deputy PM today on his policy on a referendum on House of Lords reform.

Another Conservative u-turn to add to the ever growing list of them...

Let's be fair on David Cameron for once. It's very easy to forget which team you support. Nick Clegg spent 5 years forgetting his. Sat Apr 25 09:57:59 BST 2015

@guinners1 what about the women too ? :-) Wed Apr 22 17:03:43 BST 2015
Haven't yet seen the D&R Tory leaflet but already had complaints that there's no ref to Stockport in it yet 1/3 of the seat is in that town! Wed Apr 22 16:56:15 BST 2015
@charliebobs1 I agree. I'll be celebrating St George's Day tomorrow, and think others should too. Should be a public holiday IMHO. Wed Apr 22 13:53:22 BST 2015
En route to Kingswood for some #Labour campaigning with @jomccarron after a great morning campaigning with my mate @annesnelgrove #GE2015 Wed Apr 22 11:59:11 BST 2015

@karinsmyth @annesnelgrove @jomccarron @SWLabourParty pleasure to help Labour candidates in the South West. You're crucial to a Labour Gov! Tue Apr 21 20:31:01 BST 2015
Blimey, now Swindon Tory says 48hr guarantee for patients to see a GP should not be restored. @annesnelgrove will support it. Tue Apr 21 20:19:38 BST 2015
Swindon Tory calls Labour's Time to Care Fund (fully funded) "Bits on the edge". 20,000 extra nurses, 8,000 more Doctors (@annesnelgrove) Tue Apr 21 20:16:42 BST 2015
@torykipper @annesnelgrove @GwynneCllr yes. Tue Apr 21 20:06:28 BST 2015
Can't kid GPs. Swindon Tory being told by a doctor that the extra GPs he's taking credit for were trained under Labour. (@annesnelgrove) Tue Apr 21 20:04:08 BST 2015
@Bluemoon1956 never a problem! Tue Apr 21 19:44:00 BST 2015
@247SQN would love to but maybe after the election?  :-) Tue Apr 21 19:42:16 BST 2015
@Bluemoon1956 after the election if re-elected, yes. As I'm not currently an MP, I can't hold them now sadly. Tue Apr 21 19:39:59 BST 2015
Q from GP asking for Health&Soc Care Act to be swept away. @annesnelgrove commits to repeal. Tory defends Act. "Leave things as they are"! Tue Apr 21 19:39:14 BST 2015
@Bluemoon1956 through the hospital's complaints procedure and by 8th May also through the MP. Tue Apr 21 19:34:47 BST 2015

Off out for some local campaigning in a bit, then to check that Maisie is alright. Thanks to all for your concern yesterday! Appreciated. Sun Apr 19 11:54:25 BST 2015
@shameside quite frankly while our daughter is unwell we have more important things to concern ourselves with than your silly little games. Sun Apr 19 11:42:45 BST 2015
Enough said! Vote #Labour http://t.co/eeArbVyyQH Sat Apr 18 22:41:07 BST 2015
@LoobyFish oh dear :( hope ok? Maisie is fine (apart from blue lips) Sat Apr 18 22:06:56 BST 2015
@1ofthe8015mcfc thanks Alan. Still no closer as to why she's going blue but doesn't seem life threatening! Sat Apr 18 21:10:14 BST 2015
Finally out of hospital with Maisie. They think from tests that she's ok, but not sure why her lips keep going blue when she moves around. Sat Apr 18 21:05:45 BST 2015
Very very impressed with the Children's Unit at @TamesideHFT - staff are excellent and Maisie is being well looked after. Sat Apr 18 17:19:10 BST 2015
Off to see a paediatrician at Tameside Hospital now...not how I expected to spend a glorious Saturday afternoon, bit best to get Mai checked Sat Apr 18 16:42:12 BST 2015
@Steve__Allinson @frozenwarning @GwynneCllr staff brilliant. Double checking Maisie over now. :) Sat Apr 18 16:01:43 BST 2015

@frozenwarning @GwynneCllr @Steve__Allinson I have! I work shadowed at Tameside last year. Sat Apr 18 15:38:48 BST 2015
@frozenwarning @GwynneCllr @Steve__Allinson I said it's like hell on earth. If you were here you'd agree. Noone is happy in the waiting area Sat Apr 18 15:37:29 BST 2015
@frozenwarning @GwynneCllr @Steve__Allinson lots of crying & screaming. No one Gave up seat for heavily pregnant lady; water m/c leaking Sat Apr 18 15:36:43 BST 2015
@frozenwarning @GwynneCllr @Steve__Allinson who said anything about the staff? Waiting room is too small and standing room only; kids bored Sat Apr 18 15:34:53 BST 2015
@frozenwarning @GwynneCllr @Steve__Allinson the patient experience so far is less than acceptable. Not surprised people go to A&E instead! Sat Apr 18 15:29:06 BST 2015
Me & @GwynneCllr have unanimously declared Ashton Primary Care Centre on Saturday is the closest thing to hell on earth, @Steve__Allinson ;) Sat Apr 18 15:19:55 BST 2015

@Pelepurves well I know I'm biased but @MarpleLeaf is well worth voting for. Sat Apr 18 09:46:59 BST 2015
@Pelepurves or the fact she was threatening last year to defect to the LibDems along with Paul Moss, which is why he was deselected. Sat Apr 18 09:43:27 BST 2015
Beautiful day to go over to the equally beautiful High Peak constituency for some key seat campaigning with #Labour's @CaitlinBisknell Sat Apr 18 08:43:16 BST 2015

@chrisshipitv @MichaelLCrick yes but the earliest they could start to go out is this week. Many councils will issue new PVs in extra batches Fri Apr 17 22:30:29 BST 2015

Tories saying tonight was a vision of the future - they're right: Cameron wasn't in it #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 22:06:35 BST 2015
Even the DUP say the PM should've been in the debate just now. So come on, let's have that head to head with @Ed_Miliband #BBCDebate #Frit Thu Apr 16 21:53:29 BST 2015
@1ofthe8015mcfc I know we have a different political outlook, but on Danny Alexander we are as one! http://t.co/CSYA44XlsG Thu Apr 16 21:47:51 BST 2015
3 weeks left. Any time. Any place. any where... Why's David Cameron so frit? #BBCDebate  https://t.co/sNVXWNvInR Thu Apr 16 21:40:48 BST 2015
@Ed_Miliband has just challenged David Cameron to a proper head to head debate. If he wants the job he should 
turn up for the interview. Thu Apr 16 21:29:40 BST 2015
For me, @Ed_Miliband is the clear winner. It was a serious debate 
and he was relaxed & considered. A real Prime Minister #BBCdebates Thu Apr 16 21:28:48 BST 2015
@Deepvoice80 lol Thu Apr 16 21:23:48 BST 2015
It's basic arithmetic: For every one less Labour MP there is, it's more likely that Cameron will be PM in a Tory-led Government 
#BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:21:57 BST 2015
Why the Prime Minister won't debate tonight: There is a crisis in A&E - more 
patients waiting longer than four hours in A&E #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:09:38 BST 2015
Hits the nail on the head: "Here's the problem with you Nigel, you want to exploit peoples' fears not solve them." @Ed_Miliband #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:07:24 BST 2015
#BBCDebate - Where's the PM? https://t.co/etNZUQANmM Thu Apr 16 21:00:07 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband is relaxed and confident and is the only alternative PM in #BBCDebate. Not surprised Cameron was so scared of a head to head. Thu Apr 16 20:58:19 BST 2015
Cameron hasn't bothered to turn up to answer serious questions on the deficit, housing & national defence. What's he frit of? #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:45:18 BST 2015
Whoops, the only man defending David Cameron's policies is now attacking the audience it seems. #KeepDigging #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:36:15 BST 2015
PM won't debate because OBR says  Tories are planning cuts that are "more severe" than "anything we've seen in the last 5 yrs" #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:26:05 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband is right:"The real danger for this country is from a 
re-elected David Cameron who will double the spending cuts" #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:22:01 BST 2015
Fact: Farage is backing Cameron: UKIP back their extreme 
spending plans & experts say this means a "sharp acceleration" in cuts #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:17:26 BST 2015
EdM is the only alternative PM on BBC #leadersdebate: "If I'm Prime Minister I'll always put working families 
first" That's the PM we need Thu Apr 16 20:08:55 BST 2015

Take a look at what David Cameron has done in the last 5 years... No wonder he's ducking the debate tonight! http://t.co/aFcBmYAI7E Thu Apr 16 08:00:39 BST 2015
Not sure the LibDems have thought through their Wizard of Oz analogy... Surely this makes Clegg a cowardly lion? Oh. Wed Apr 15 22:14:26 BST 2015

@1ofthe8015mcfc so that properties don't fall into hands of Rachman style private landlords. 8,000 now on Tameside housing waiting list too Tue Apr 14 22:54:54 BST 2015
@1ofthe8015mcfc was actually started by Wilson Govt, but Thatcher rolled out big time. Personally think Councils should have RTB back too Tue Apr 14 22:53:39 BST 2015
@1ofthe8015mcfc and many are privately rented now, so don't meet decent homes standard and cost more to rent too! Tue Apr 14 22:48:52 BST 2015

@BBCPropaganda I'll be voting on Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh matters in this Bill at 2nd Reading.
@BBCPropaganda @Debbie_abrahams @unionstogether depends on who gets appointed to the committee. Let's get through 2nd reading first!
@BBCPropaganda @Debbie_abrahams @unionstogether you only have one vote at 2nd reading - for the whole bill - which has a UK wide remit.
@BBCPropaganda @Debbie_abrahams @unionstogether it's what's in the Bill that counts. For English NHS it's also about repeal of HASC Act 2012
@BBCPropaganda @Debbie_abrahams @unionstogether hopefully plenty. The Bill exempts the 3 devolved NHS systems from TTIP too so is UK wide!
MT @unionstogether: @GwynneMP will be voting to protect our NHS. Visit http://t.co/sVeaTkcAEW for info.   http://t.co/70z2W1mxct
@Kate_Butler yep @alex_jbutler will be a good addition to the team too. Let's get him involved in our campaigns!

@val_hudson you're damn right too ;-)
@sudavis I'm backing @CliveEfford's Bill Su, don't worry!
@angelabinkee2 we'll need to consider it all within the numbers announced in the Time to Care Fund. It's all about integration in community.
‚Äú@sudavis: Call from @GwynneMP for members to lobby Tory & LibDem MPs to back @CliveEfford bill on anti privatisation of the NHS‚Äù
@bludreid11 @jimmurphymp @Margaret_Curran TTIP exemption is in black and white. It's being voted on on 21 Nov. Labour is backing the Bill.
@bludreid11 @jimmurphymp @Margaret_Curran then you'll see on 21 Nov. TTIP exemption is in the Efford Bill.
@bludreid11 @jimmurphymp @Margaret_Curran not true. Labour will be voting to exempt the 4 NHS systems in UK from TTIP on 21 Nov #EffordBill

@nmc_yellow nor do you. Night x
@nmc_yellow Captain Cawley wasn't a Labour MP. It's about paying respect to those who died, not time for a political point.
@nmc_yellow there was a memorial service today for MPs for the places represented by past fallen MPs. I represent Audenshaw today.

@FraserNelson ...and Salford (another GM Council) votes YES, and now have a city Mayor. This time it's a GM Conurbation-wide Mayor on offer.
@mess6311 did it today
@ArmitageJW there's a lot to be angry about ;-)
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 ...and there's a small matter of a General Election first. Be interesting to see what's in manifestos on this!
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 it's up to parliament. Devolution can't happen unless we vote to make it happen. GM Mayor needs legislating for
@Ashwins2011 barmy
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts Iain said earlier, that's why there's 3 yrs of public consultation, to hopefully get it right.
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts except it's a different role. This is conurbation-wide, covering all 10 boroughs, not just Mcr
@Spetmologer but this *is* IDS's department. 10% is probably an achievement for him!
@Spetmologer and this glass in only 10% full!
@NickStathamMEN @TSAdvertiser I am just in the Chamber at the moment.
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts that was to replace Council leader in MCC. Salford voted for an elected mayor (and have one)
Just pointed out to DWP Minister the Work Programme has failed those on ESA. Only 10% helped. Doing nothing to help the remaining 90%.
@KieranJByrne @GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts to be fair to Osborne (I'm not usually) that's why he won't devolve to just the 10 Leaders.
@robsmithitv @lucywestITV only Manchester City residents. Salford City residents voted for (and have) one. Other 8 boroughs never been asked
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts there are polls conducted since Scot Ref showing people in parts of Eng want Devo.Not got links am on train!
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts ...but won't do without some accountability. There's a timetable for 2017. GMCA have 3 years to consult!
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts this is the start of the process George. The GMCA exists. They want more power. Osborne wants to give it...
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts there's a GE next year, and I'm sure parties will set out their own plans on English Devo in manifestos.
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts I believe the public do want more power from Westminster, yep... Especially after Scotland Ref.
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts ... Westminster to approve things like Parliamentary powers to build new tramlines etc!
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts ... I'd like to see GM attain secondary legislation powers too, like Welsh Assembly had, so don't need...
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts ...and that can't be done without some democratic accountability beyond the 10 Council Leaders.
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts this is a ¬£1bn + deal, but GM (rightly) want control over most of ¬£22bn public spend in county...
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts timetable is there for consultation but GM want the powers ASAP. Govt is starting process of devolution now.
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts this is a good deal for GM. Only the starting point. I want more devolved from London!
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts not another layer of bureaucracy because GMCA already exists (10 Leaders), the Mayor will be an 11th member
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts the mandate will be when he or she is directly elected by GM's 2m+ electors. We've never elected AGMA/GMCA.
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts my only concern is there'll be an 'interim' GM Mayor for 3 years before we get to vote for an actual one!
@GeorgeNewton1 @CllrIainRoberts what was rejected in 2012 was replacing MCC Leader and Cabinet, not a GM-wide Mayor on combined authority

@grannymargaret2 will do x
@iBreezeblock and is still promoted on the Tameside Countryside website:  http://t.co/ctdCTbhjwV
@iBreezeblock yes there can, it's officially Green Belt in the Tameside Development Plan and classed as Country Park and public greenspace.
@iBreezeblock indeed. When I met with Landcare on site about their signs, they hadn't appreciated what they'd got.
@iBreezeblock not sure. I'm going to FOI it. I think it was a single price for the lot as I was told it was a portfolio of sites.
@iBreezeblock we didn't ask them to buy a country park, and to be fair to them, they hadn't appreciated they'd bought one in the portfolio
@iBreezeblock we support renewable energy, but I object to this being about us losing an established country park so Landcare can make ¬£¬£¬£.
@iBreezeblock yes and no. It's previously developed land but is within the Greater Manchester Greenbelt as it's been country park since 1976
@AndrewGraystone the application is online. The photos on the earlier post were all taken today. Like this: http://t.co/OcQTGiirax
@iBreezeblock no. I only found out when Landcare put up some incorrect & ugly signs in Jet Amber so I contacted them to get them removed.
@AndrewGraystone it's not been a landfill site for 40 years. It was made into a country park by GMC in 1976.
@iBreezeblock my criticism is the officers at GMWDA didn't consult anyone, they just offloaded lots of sites in one go.
@iBreezeblock because GMWDA sold off all their closed sites two years ago, without any public consultation. Jet Amber was bought by Landcare

@James_monk1 I agree!!!
@James_monk1 no I mean the transparency - everything published. Now the computer system is unfathomable
@James_monk1 I didn't agree with IPSA anyway, as it's less transparent and more costly admin than the HoC system became after the scandal.
@mess6311 you have to sign the prayer and hand it in. Will do on Monday.
@mess6311 @MattWrack will do next week
@James_monk1 well I embrace it, and Facebook too. Think online exchanges can work if you try at it.

@James_monk1 I do. That's what I like about Twitter.
@James_monk1 or you'd never make a decision for fear of upsetting one group. That's not power to the people, it's power to powerful lobbies!
@James_monk1 that surely what an election is for??? Recall must be for serious wrongdoing not on how an MP votes on issues like gay marriage
@James_monk1 we need proper recall for acts of serious wrongdoing, not on how an MP votes on an issue. That's what General Elections are for
@James_monk1 I voted against an amendment that would allow recall to be triggered over how an MP votes on an issue. That's antidemocratic.
@James_monk1 I voted to give the Recall Bill a 2nd reading. It's now in committee where various amendments are being considered.
@JacobSutcliffe I also support Green Belt and recreation. This is a country park.

@JulieElliottMP @PoliticalYeti not you is it Julie? ;-)
@UKIP_Tameside @jreynoldsMP we didn't. We voted for 2nd reading and against an antidemocratic amendment to trigger petition on how MP votes
Just asked the Northern Ireland Secretary about the #BedroomTax and Welfare Reform in NI. Seems the UK Govt's plans are in a mess there too!

@BillEstersonMP @AnnaYearley @GwynneCat @GwynnePup oh dear :(
@BillEstersonMP @AnnaYearley so did I Bill... Sadly @GwynneCat went all playful. He thinks we bought him @Gwynnepup so we had to keep her!!
@BillEstersonMP @AnnaYearley @GwynneCat nor @GwynnePup!!! Shhh
Partners.... But Tim is homeless, can someone give him a loving home? He's at @DogsTrust Essex. Someone, please :-) http://t.co/iQzNRji9w0
http://t.co/V0K58rmGgf <Why Langtree's "spin" needs a public airing. I'll apply for an adjournment debate in Parliament to make public.
@PaulMoss7971 but actually I find that tweet offensive and without any basis. Accusing me of bullying is very serious. Withdraw it please.
@PaulMoss7971 Paul, grow up!!!! I haven't a clue what you're on about.
@PaulMoss7971 it allows you to speak the truth without fear or favour, why Paul??
@OffertonLabour go and have your hissy elsewhere. No one is interested anymore.
@OffertonLabour haha xx
@OffertonLabour harassment??!! FFS grow up Laura. You're using another registered political party's name.
@OffertonLabour oh and I think you need to update your Twitter name. You're not Labour. No point misleading the public.
@OffertonLabour prove it. You show me your evidence and I'll show you mine x
@OffertonLabour now that's not true is it Laura. You can only reinvent history if the truth isn't evidenced.
Might apply for a debate in Parliament to put some correct facts into the public domain... Parliamentary privilege comes in handy sometimes!
@CllrIainRoberts @OffertonLabour utter rubbish Iain. It's because his deselection appeal was thrown out yesterday. That's all!
‚Äú@charliebobs1: @unitedutilities @GwynneMP @TamesideCouncil aaah right. Looks like it's being used by road workers then.‚Äù <@highwaysagency??
Tim, part pointer, part collie is in need of a home. He's at @DogsTrust Essex. Come on Britain, don't let him down! http://t.co/u9eDQgvxZ7
@warren90 yes, the Denton service is a public event. http://t.co/gctPJZD6dm
‚Äú@KCLovesDogs: @gwynnemp up first in the interview ring this morning! #WestminsterDog http://t.co/9TVzYg0AjN‚Äù
With Tim for the Westminster Dog of the Year. He's a @DogsTrust rescue and needs a home! http://t.co/runLeofdlu
@charliebobs1 @TamesideCouncil think it might be @unitedutilities doing work? Certainly the Thirlmere aqueduct runs through the site.
@marzy120 @MissKingsley85 @MissJPlant I'm in London, but I'm sure @GwynneCllr and Cllr Mike Fowler could if they have a spare moment!

@CllrMcAuley @OffertonLabour @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews LibDems run Stockport Patrick I've already reported SMBC to LGO over RVCP fiasco
@CllrMcAuley @OffertonLabour @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews my orders??? What kind of party do the LibDems run. Do your MPs "order you"??!!
@CllrMcAuley @OffertonLabour @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews whatever Patrick. I don't hold up posters I don't believe in unlike Nock Clegg!
@CllrMcAuley @OffertonLabour @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews no Patrick. Other reasons. http://t.co/xH5Sj7EODi
@OffertonLabour @CllrMcAuley @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews happy to show you the facts Todd.
@CllrMcAuley @OffertonLabour @TFitzgeraldMEN @stockportnews not that he was deselected weeks ago and his appeal has been rejected today? Oh

Wow. My website has had 12000 hits since I posted on Langtree's plans for the Oldham Batteries site in Denton. People care about their Town!
@darrenrav no, I'm introducing some of the dogs in the dog parade apparently!
@GaryWaites @DogsTrust see: http://t.co/F7eUhnP7iM
@darrenrav @DogsTrust see: http://t.co/F7eUhnP7iM
@darrenrav @DogsTrust not sure what time it opens to the public tomorrow. Afternoon I guess.
@McDermottQC @RebeccaHerber44 @tara_snow good job Tim isn't an MPs dog then. Just trying to get him some rehoming publicity poor chap!
‚Äú@LabourEoin: For once, I agree with David Cameron. http://t.co/XWy9zLzxjT‚Äù
@McDermottQC @RebeccaHerber44 @GwynnePup there'll be a few needing homes at the @DogsTrust centre in Denton (behind Sainsbury's)
@RebeccaHerber44 @McDermottQC Tim is a rescue dog (don't tell @GwynnePup I'm being unfaithful)
Looking forward to the opening of the new @DogsTrust Rehoming Centre in Denton tomorrow. Oh and please vote for Tim! http://t.co/LS7QI8lqP0
@joswan1 everyone was told something slightly differently as the night went on it seems. Remediation cost will be very high for residential!

MYTHBUSTING: Langtree‚Äôs Oldham Batteries¬†‚Äòspin‚Äô http://t.co/0pijQnoLGR
@craigw327 no, it's grotesque to think that in the year 2014 big business can employ disabled people to do a valid job & pay them below NMW!
@joswan1 indeed. They have a CPO granted to acquire the land they need on Ashton Road. All they've got to do is pay the Council to use power
@dentontown my view is this: http://t.co/S1y0vKEcGJ
@VegasTaffy The Council didn't. They got regen money for it. And it's not in my constituency so not for me to campaign on.
@victoriadesmond actually I'm entering a @DogsTrust dog who's up for rehoming, hopefully they'll find a good home too!
Seems Langtree are saying Council (ie you and me) should pay for Oldham Batteries link road while they make mega profits from the housing!
‚Äú@GaryWaites: it appears that everything hinges on a set of lights in Edward Street #chaos #gridlock http://t.co/XpbOKRijFM‚Äù <awful
@GaryWaites indeed. They just do not get it!!!
@GaryWaites good to hear. Important they hear the views of Denton residents on this issue.

@CllrIainRoberts @Kate_Butler @paulharrison68 no reason why you should.
@CllrIainRoberts @Kate_Butler @paulharrison68 no bullying Iain. You only know half a story, but don't let that get in the way.
@craigw327 @LabourHealth no.
Great meeting with Haughton Dale residents. Next steps to start consultation on Neighbourhood Plan for the area to protect our heritage.

@jacksduncan plus the block grant on NHS shouldn't be being cut because it's proportionately 'Barnetted' to England's budget.
@jacksduncan and the Scots Gov has tax raising powers they've never used + more to come!
@DoctorAngry @FrancesHinde and Andy Burnham scrapped Any Willing Provider for NHS Preferred Provider, which he'll reintroduce.
@jacksduncan not from an English Secretary of State it's not. NHS in Scotland is for the Scottish Gov to run.

What a disgrace nutty Nuttall is OPPOSING @KeeleyMP's Bill to exempt Carers from the #BedroomTax. Bury can do better than this: @JimmyFrith
Now I'm supporting the excellent @KeeleyMP with her Bill to exempt Carers from the #BedroomTax. I hope Tories don't try to block it!
Asked the Attorney General how many councils adopted the protocol to share info with police & prosecutors for child sex abuse. Non answer!
Wish I could shake off this blasted "conference" cold. Is one of the worst I've had for years. Seriously impairing my ability to function!

@Bluemoon1956 @BrooklineDems there is. It's called spoiling your ballot paper. But at least you made the point!
@dimayray @GwynnePup she's a chihuahua - I don't think she needs a giant beef bone. A rat bone would be mammoth to her! :-)
@janinewat @GwynnePup it's ok the bone wouldn't even fit in her tiny mouth. It was an opportunist move on her part.
Seems Lottie (@GwynnePup) has got the lamb bone, and she isn't giving it back! Ooooh no! http://t.co/0WEkgcicGY
@DanJarvisMP totally misread your tweet while scrolling as "talking to UKIP". Talk about a minor heart palpitation here! :-)
@PhWolstencroft @GeorgeNewton1 thanks. My website went bonkers yesterday after it was posted on the Denton Memories FB page
@PhWolstencroft @GeorgeNewton1 thanks Philip. Every little helps. Got to mobilise the town, so please spread the word!
@herbertson46 I already have. Threw them out of my office. I can't go to meeting as am in London. Hope the town gives em hell!
@GeorgeNewton1 plus it is a prime town centre site. Just how incompetent are Langtree that they can't market it properly?
@GeorgeNewton1 indeed. 10 years of false promises and dereliction, now a substandard development and potential traffic chaos!

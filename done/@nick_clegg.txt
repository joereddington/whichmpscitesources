@nick_clegg
A sensible decision by Sheffield United regarding Ched Evans. Step in the right direction.
Very happy also to meet up with volunteers from @LittleSheffield who help parents of city with childcare issues. http://t.co/7v6EuX5YFH
Great to be a part of @MumsnetTowers #FamilyFriendly Awards tonight  recognising family friendly policies in the workplace.
Very pleased that @lfeatherstone pushed for Julien Blanc to be denied entry to the UK.
Excellent news today that the average full-time pay gap between men and women is at its narrowest since comparative records began in 1997.
Looking forward to taking part @bitetheballot’s #LeadersLive debate on December 16.
Saddened to learn that British man, Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, was mercilessly killed in the terrorist attacks in Jerusalem.
Very sad to wake up to news of what is believed to be a terrorist attack in a Synagogue in Jerusalem. Thoughts with people of that holy city
Great Twitter Q&A thanks for all your questions today.
@Sexpression Have supported for years, long before it was fashionable! Real struggle to persuade Tories.
@Kirstylmarchant It should do. That's next phase of childcare reform in our manifesto for election.
@jack_fletcher1Make parental leave, flexible working etc equally available Gender pay gap still way too big. Big cos should publish pay gaps
@BennettArron Yes. Great campaign. Bullying of all kinds, not least new on line threats, needs confronting.
@Matt_RJ87 You bet Econ recovery not poss without us. Nor would fairer taxes, more apprentices, green energy boost, help for poorer kids etc
@RichardNorthey Prob is under old rules women had no choice. Had to take time off even if they wanted work. Bad for lots of small cos.
@Domtheseal We are. just gone up to £6.50 and Vince C has asked Low Pay Comm to go for above infl increases.
@jackeryyyy Mums 'n dads should make up their own minds how to divvy up parental leave. will be able to from next April.
@JacobMCampbell Single party govt Cons or Lab would be v bad. Lab can't look after econ, cons don't know fairness. LDs needed in govt!
@alexjmichie Learned hard way realities of govt at times of econ crisis. But v v proud of fairer taxes, pensions, apprentices, childcare etc
@VivaLaTisha Stone Age.
@Sameet10 LD MPs and Lab MPs not enough to form majority. Govts without majorities can't take decisions.
@Gingerbread Just spoke to folk at Deloitte - have great agile working rules. other big cos have modern parental leave rules. leading by eg.
@Gaz_Ince True school hols, esp half terms, can be tricky for working parents. but don't think treating schools like offices is the answer.
@SWRUCAB Childcare costs finally starting to come down. good news. still way to go tho. 85% of childcare costs will be covered by UC.
.@RichardNorthey No evidence that better parental leave stops small cos from doing well. Happier employees make better employees
.@JKOOMO @nick_clegg 15 hrs free help to all 3s and 4s, 15 hrs free help to all 2s from poorer families, tax free childcare next yr
Ready to go - will try to get thru as many questions as possible.
I'll be starting my Twitter Q&A in about 10 mins time, a little later than scheduled. Sorry for the delay.
Tweet me your questions on childcare, paternity leave & family-friendly issues. I'll be answering them live in about 20 mins.
I'll be hosting at Twitter Q&A at 11.30am today. Tweet me your questions on family-friendly working.
My thoughts are with the family of Abdul-Rahman Kassig today. ISIL have once again shown how barbaric they are.
Rape threats against @J_Ennis are sick and vile. This is totally out of order.
I think @bbcnickrobinson has some competition here from young Alex from @BBCSchoolReport #SkillsShow in Birmingham. http://t.co/bSxtYUJfHJ

So this #indyref marks not only a new chapter for Scotland within the UK but a new chapter of constitutional renewal across the UK.
The #indyref has led to demand for constitutional reform across the UK. People want power in their own hands, not hoarded in Westminster.
A vote against independence was not a vote against change and we must deliver on time and in full the package of new powers to Scotland.
In a dangerous and uncertain world I have no doubt we are stronger, safer, and more prosperous together than we ever could be apart #indyref
I'm absolutely delighted the Scottish people have taken this momentous decision to safeguard our family of nations for future generations.
The people of Scotland have cast their votes. I sincerely hope that they remain a part of our family of nations. #indyref

ISIL are a brutal terrorist outfit whose actions are an affront to every peace loving Muslim around the world.

Liberal Democrats will always fight for the same things abroad as we do at home: stronger economies and fairer societies. #ProudofUKaid
In our election manifesto, we will make class discussions and info about FGM a required part of the school curriculum in high-prev areas.
I want to pay tribute to @lfeatherstone for her tireless work to increase the public's understanding of this unnecessary, harmful practice.
FGM is one of the most extreme manifestations of gender-based violence there is. But working together, across nations, we can end FGM
The cynicism of aid sceptics, UKIP and others on the right, is out of step with our national interest. #ProudofUKaid
The help we provide is the hallmark of a Britain that is open, compassionate and engaged in the world #ProudofUKaid
The things we do with this money helps people abroad. It also helps people in Britain too- making people safer and more prosperous.
On average, people believe that around 20% of all money UK spends in a year goes on foreign aid. It's actually 0.7%
The commitment to spend 0.7% of our nation's wealth on aid, and enshrine it in law, will be in Lib Dem manifesto #ProudofUKaid
Giving a speech today about Lib Dem commitment to int dev and how I'm proud of British values of openness and helping others. #ProudofUKaid

@KulganofCrydee @bbcnickrobinson Actually some think tanks et al say the figure is as high as 4 million. but why put any job at risk?
@arembooks @bbcnickrobinson with 50% of everything we export going to the rest of the eu we'd be mad to put all that at risk.
@Hayley_Spore i so happen to love indian alfonso mangos which are affected - but safety comes first.

.@melindiscott No it's not. See you next time. Thanks http://t.co/jR7u7HPmce
.@georgecarson_ yes. New Erasmus+ scheme gives 240,000 young Brits opportunity to study abroad. https://t.co/3olNdZUqYz
.@CrisisXVII not just flood measures. UKIP voted against all of these too http://t.co/d5KoeNMimO
.@NathanialHine Yes it is! Stanage Edge, my favourite spot of all.
.@Desboy1 nope. But ask the PM. He was there on holiday recently.
.@kanecalvin he usually does. Did you see his last back heel volley? Genius.
@CCKingsbury jobs, jobs, jobs.
.@sausagemonkey64 Wookey hole, Dorset cheddar.
.@HugoFielding have done by £30bn.
.@joerayment91 Greens all over the place. Against single market and jobs sometimes for IN, sometimes for OUT. Voting shows LD MEPs greenest.
.@Student_1984 @LibDems it's monthly not annual! Absurd waste of £150m a year. Lib Dem MEPs have been leading the campaign for change
.@Kim_Peta @LibDems CBI say net benefit is approx £3000 per household. We gain so much more than we pay in.
.@Sanjava anything Mediterranean.
.@tomturner0006 yes to reform - can only do that by being in. You've got to be in it to win it.
.@dan_davies91 about half a billion in EU. That's a lot of customers.
.@idvck have gone further than that already: passed a law in 2011 guaranteeing referendum when powers go to Brussels
.@nimuealba and here's the proof http://t.co/kn31yaIRgJ
.@nimuealba Like all populists across Europe, I think they are plain wrong and don't pull their weight
.@DouglasDickie1 Atletico. I always go for the underdog.
.@1bunlady No it won't. More trade = more jobs. Isolationists think fewer jobs is price worth paying.
.@KulganofCrydee yes to a referendum but no to a timetable set to paper over the cracks in the Conservative Party
Ready to go. Send me your questions on Europe. @nick_clegg
I'll be on twitter today between 15:00-15:30 taking your questions about Europe. Send your questions to @nick_clegg

.@n4dav Will ask my office to find out. Would love to if I can.
.@TimWilliams72 Britain IN not OUT. More jobs and trade. Less waste & red tape. More police work together. EU  leading world on climate.
.@rogerth24874089 to take allowance to £12,500
.@davebroadbridge Govt estimates over 3m. Others say over 4m. Either way it's a lot of livelihoods at stake.
.@Tobar26th strawberry everytime. And I dunk my hobnobs.
@_DavidGriffiths teaching.
.@GardnerTVFTW one thing's for sure: EU countries must depend less in future on Russian oil and gas. @EdwardDaveyMP pursuing in EU.
.@JamesThornetto @LibDems Will send you a fire proof one if you vote for us.
Backing up my last answer, here are the facts http://t.co/b7p4tMVu3c
.@matthud59 your son will repay less per month than your daughter.
.@luciopezz more say for national parliaments. More openness in council of mins. MEPs holding commision to account.
.@IcySedgwick jobs, jobs, jobs.
.@aldoingy Being Scottish and British = best of both worlds.
.@psychotic_pete already is. We're the first govt to put mental and physical health on same footing in law http://t.co/DRpyZqmpI1
.@tomcmmiller you're right. This is also about hope vs fear, open vs closed, confident vs cowering. What kind of country do we want to be?
.@Jules_NS pro EU = pro reform. Can't win argument for less bureaucracy, more trade if you're halfway out.
.@supersizefries It's total nonsense. And even UKIP admit it. The evidence is here: Page 18: http://t.co/1vbh036DY4  
.@emilyryall massively important. Just check this out. http://t.co/WeyUDz9qOw
.@rachelle1234567 US, China, Brazil, et al listen to massive EU trade bloc. On our own we'd get the short straw.
.@lross50 Some estimates say around 1m jobs in the North linked to EU membership. Isolationists don't care, jobs lost?
.@BanksJenny can't beat climate change on our own. Can't create green jobs unless we are in the EU.
.@Jedi4Peace @LibDems you don't win a fight unless you are prepared to get in the ring.
To back up that last answer, take a look at this http://t.co/KIPGVXW1zW
.@SimondForbes For a start, Miliband and Cameron could stop sitting on their hands. They're missing in action. When will they make the case?
@seldomseenkid not against. Would relish referendum at right time, when new powers go to EU. We've made that law.
@tobyornot_toby EU best repsonse to globalisation = strength in numbers

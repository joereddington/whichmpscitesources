.@joswinson and I fought hard against the Tories to guarantee all large companies publish difference in pay between men and women. Sat Mar 07 10:22:01 GMT 2015
It simply cannot be acceptable that, in the twenty first century, women on average still receive a smaller pay packet than men. Sat Mar 07 10:16:28 GMT 2015

IFS figs show we're heading in the right direction but still a long way to go. That's why we must stick to a sensible economic plan. 1/2 Wed Mar 04 11:23:55 GMT 2015

The WC in winter won't feel right. I agree with @johnleechmcr - this is not the basis on which Qatar bid for WC and process should be rerun. Tue Feb 24 16:27:21 GMT 2015
That is the Tory policy - tough on the weak but soft on the strong. Nothing asked of rich pensioners but working age poor to be hammered. Mon Feb 23 12:32:39 GMT 2015

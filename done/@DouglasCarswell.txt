@MrsStaceyColley @shiv37 you are correct. It is the school in the background. Flag has nothing to do with said school Mon Apr 27 11:52:02 BST 2015
UKIP flag flying over Holland (to be clear, this is not being flown by any school) http://t.co/lH7GKYV6mX Mon Apr 27 11:22:16 BST 2015
2b clear, this UKIP flag is not flying in Walton school or anything 2 do w/ Walton school. Tis a great flag though! http://t.co/hM1m6mtjWE Mon Apr 27 10:29:08 BST 2015

@montie me, too! Let's speak after the election Sun Apr 26 13:53:27 BST 2015
@TheAquaFresca @montie Safe seats if your on the A list .... Sun Apr 26 13:51:39 BST 2015
@montie too many fiefdom seats to make that kind of change Tim. Creates toxic culture of obsequiousness combined w/ ineffectual campaigning Sun Apr 26 13:50:49 BST 2015
@xtophercook @montie the modernisers failed to modernise. A-lister not proper primaries. Top down rather than grass roots. #iDemocracy Sun Apr 26 13:44:07 BST 2015
@montie They've had that chance Tim. Once again they offer a tepid, fatuous prospectus and seek fear to drive supporters to the polls. Sun Apr 26 13:37:54 BST 2015
@montie Tim, good folk have been saying that since 1997. What if they cannot change? Sun Apr 26 13:34:32 BST 2015

@928ster @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage his early interviews were good. Refreshing. Now it's usual Guardian TV stuff Thu Apr 23 22:24:46 BST 2015
@LordOfPimps @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage it does. But Evan - like IFS - probably didn't bother with the UKIP one Thu Apr 23 22:23:23 BST 2015
@LordOfPimps @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage @afneil Andrew is the toughest interviewer imo. Precisely because he gets where you're coming from Thu Apr 23 22:22:12 BST 2015
@928ster @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage actually I rate him. Which is what makes his dire questioning rather depressing Thu Apr 23 22:20:02 BST 2015
@Dexterker @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage when Newsnight asked me on to talk manifesto, I didn't get a single question about it. Thu Apr 23 22:11:39 BST 2015
@MarcusStead @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage like all aristocrats, the aristos at the top of the BBC can't see themselves as others see them Thu Apr 23 22:03:56 BST 2015
@emmasnosey @EvanHD @FarageUKIP wasn't it bizarre? Not a single policy question. Just sneer and jeer - with question mark at the end Thu Apr 23 22:02:14 BST 2015
@LewistoryMary @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage I think Evan seriously misjudged that. But BBC pundits tend not to care Thu Apr 23 21:58:58 BST 2015
@the_kid49 @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage not sure about that. The trouble is that Evan probably can't even see how unreasonable he was being Thu Apr 23 21:57:26 BST 2015
@FCC_Scooter I'm looking forward to being there! Thu Apr 23 21:55:31 BST 2015
@LordOfPimps @EvanHD @Nigel_Farage it was a sneer and jeer job. A line of questioning reserved by the BBC for UKIP. Thu Apr 23 21:54:27 BST 2015
Catching up on @EvanHD interviewing @Nigel_Farage on Newsnight. Questions tell us more about @EvanHD than it does UKIP. Disgraceful Thu Apr 23 21:45:58 BST 2015
@Ling491Janet I do frequently.  I understand that legal action is underway and I cannot interfere in that Thu Apr 23 20:28:49 BST 2015
That's six polls in almost as many days showing UKIP on the up. How's the bubble's peak UKIP theory coming along? Thu Apr 23 20:27:51 BST 2015
@icclesuez you are kind. Happy to give you update on progress. New operator cold take over running service Thu Apr 23 17:37:26 BST 2015
Interesting canvass data from #Frinton. Could Conservatives lose local council seats in Frinton-on-Sea for first time ever? Thu Apr 23 17:18:27 BST 2015

@icclesuez @Delayed_Again I do see your point as a regular commuter Thu Apr 23 17:06:03 BST 2015
IFS finds UKIP has detailed tax and spend plans. So why does BBC manage to report item without saying so? http://t.co/BPtc6krCRN Thu Apr 23 14:04:41 BST 2015
Only UKIP provides credible fiscal plan, says IFS. Yet @bbcp can't bring themselves to report it http://t.co/BPtc6krCRN Thu Apr 23 14:02:23 BST 2015
@icclesuez agreed. Why spend billions on HS2 when a fraction of that would improve East Anglian lines Thu Apr 23 12:32:30 BST 2015

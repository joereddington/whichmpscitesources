@mattholehouse @IsabelHardman tragedy for the left isn't it? IDemocracy dooms the left as anti establishment force.
@mattholehouse @IsabelHardman  Westminster is not a slur. It is the problem. Being against it is not a device, but a prerequisite for change
The Cameron clique would struggle to recognise a swing voter if they ever met one. It shows in #rochester
How many inside the Cameron clique have ever personally won over swing voters in a marginal seat? Not one. It shows
“@Spectator_CH: From @isabelhardman: The recklessness of CCHQ http://t.co/kWoWPtXuud” <- Cameron cliques basic errors. #MessinaWontSaveYou
@IsabelHardman what if those running established parties just aren't v good at politics? Safe seat syndrome?

@owenjbennett shhh! Don't tell anyone
@Aaron3ree I'm against it
PM promised vote on EAW in PMQs. Tonight he rushes back in white tie to quash it
Govt plan to get EAW thru Commons with minimal fuss not really worked out
Is PM back to vote in white tie from banquet yet?
@UKIP4Swaffham actually Speaker Bercow has been rather brilliant this afternoon. He called it right
The govt whips are all working the phones in panic. "I know we said go to Rochester, but we need you back here now"
@RebeccaKeating @David_Cameron seems like it
PM promised a vote on EAW today. He has failed to honour his word. Responsibility for Commons farce 100% with his whips office
@ajcdeane Commons might ruin his  dinner
Greg Hands back in his chair. Hushed, rushed whispers with whips. Perhaps they're asking "where's George?"
Massive mood gap between whips / T May cluster on frontbench and sullen, mutinous MPs behind. Ominous
Govt whips mouthing insults across the chamber. Discipline breaking down.  Shambles
Govt whips panicking. Asking Cabinet to rush back to the Commons. Inept Whips operation brought this on themselves
If any journos have written up today's Commons shambles, hold on. Not over. More drama to follow
Commons catches ministers off guards. Whips operation floundering. Panic
It's not over. Govt whips looking panicked

Ahead of #Rochester, govt dishonesty over Europe on a shambolic scale.
@tnewtondunn Deputy Chief Whip stuffed up
Govt whips office a shambles.  Had to get PM over to Commons to secure vote. Can't secure credibility
Govt whips desperate for every vote to rescue their shambles. PM asked to vote in division. And Chancellor.
The afternoon Theresa May's leadership chances collapsed
@montie much kindness towards its MPs and members. It's front bench are appalling. See underhand behaviour right now, Tim. Not my values
Was my former party always this way but I just couldn't see it - or are they falling apart? #GovtWhipsChaos
Devious and underhand tactics by govt whips have reduced Commons to a farce.
@IsabelHardman appalling behaviour by whips. Disgraceful
@GuidoFawkes govt whips tried spivish tricks. Backfired. Greg in crisis meeting with Gove
@jameschappers they are spivs
Commons chaos as govt whips spivery backfires
You can't take ministers at their word. Over the European Arrest Warrant govt whips don't even give honest words
@jameschappers Deputy Chief Whip stuffed up
Speaker rightly suggests govt whips not being straight. Awful school boy tactics by whips
Govt whips / "usual channels" stuff up Commons vote. Shambles.

David Cameron does not have my former colleagues with him on this statement. They don't believe him #NotSeriousAboutChange
David Cameron attacks "scale and timing" of £1.7Bn EU bill. But does not rule out paying it -after posturing
Thus far neither front bench has said they would refuse to pay £1.7 Bn EU bill.
Cameron's stance: can pay. Will pay - after a bit if delay and sounding very cross and challenging Commission's calculation. So there!
Sounds like PM said he'll dispute amount and methodology. He has not actually refused to pay point blank
@AllieRenison scale. Wiggle room
Classic Dave: PM sounding tough but so far not actually ruling out paying £1.7bn. After December. After all the bluster

Perfectly possible to extradite criminal suspects without Euro Arrest Warrant.
Euro Arrest Warrant meant my constituent faced extradition without British court being able to look at any evidence. Deeply illiberal

@craigawoodhouse curious how the "modernisers " consistently made mess of change eh ?
@craigawoodhouse it means you need to do them properly.  As per my Bill on primaries
Does having Conservative party leader talk over the candidates at the hustings increase or reduce local enthusiasm in the primary process?
Banking crisis showed banks not v good at banking. This anti politics thing reveals SW1 parties not much good at politics.

The sheer spivery of Coalition frontbench over recall is staggering. Never trust them when they promise political reform. Never
Big corporate parties have cooked up a deal to ensure bogus recall ..... #frontbenchFix
Frontbenchers making clear they've done a deal to quash real recall. Voters being mugged again....
Labour opposes "political" attempts to recall MPs. What the heck are MPs for if not politics? Pathetic
@tomwilson23 indeed. That is Zac's amendment and real recall
MPs talk about dangers of big money capturing politics. Surely email, YouTube and internet level playing field? Big is no longer advantage
Opponents of recall in this Commons debate have extraordinary contempt for public. They simply don't trust them
Poobahs and grandees in SW1 today been attacking idea of recall. Voters might ... horror! ... vote against MPs over policy differences.
Large number of MPs in HoC debate terrified at idea of allowing local voters to decide if they should be recalled. Bizarre.
Frank Dobson MP making the case for recall. Unintentional, perhaps. But effective
@edstaite @nigelfletcher read The Plan
@ChrisBryantMP on cracking form in recall debate!
Central flaw in Coalition recall Bill.  It does not actually have a recall vote mechanism in it
Andrew Lansley MP wants lay members to decide if recall sld be triggered. Yes, Andrew. Those lay members are called constituents
MPs discussing recall. Many terrified of allowing voters to decide their futures....
@ProfTimBale @Telegraph And still they keep on underestimating the change that is happening ....
Technology ought to be making energy cheaper, yet Britain faces an energy crisis. Sofa govt is incompetent govt  http://t.co/anEXNlFMXf
What might real bank reform look like? Here are some suggestions for After Osbrown  http://t.co/IMm4lC5BB2
Richard Lambert's crude corporatist efforts at bank reform seem to be falling apart. It's time for real bank reform #VickersFail
@cranfieldadams thanks! Good to meet you too
@AndCounting321 @simsini @MatthewdAncona well done!
@AndCounting321 @simsini @MatthewdAncona please be kind. Even to those with whom you disagree
@MatthewdAncona "Dude, what are you doing?" was how you put it at the time, I recall. It's called change, Matt. And the voters want it.
@MatthewdAncona I've been answering that question on Marr, Guardian and various other media outlets quite a lot recently ....
@grantshapps Grant has denied on air any connection between the Conservative party and telemarketing smear activity. He gave his word.
@GlynDaviesMP Agents Parris and Barroso have done sterling work
@jasonomahony you are kind, Jason. Thanks
“@whedonworship: This is not the funny parody. This is the real wanker > @DouglasCarswell <” <- RTtheHate
@MatthewdAncona your analysis of politics occasionally tells us more about you than those you seek to analyse
@KaneSilver thank you Kane!
For the record, @grantshapps is on record denying that the Conservative party has used smear push polling tactics. Let's see if that holds.
@MatthewdAncona @guardian Fear driven party?  You mean like twitter trolling the opening ceremony of the Olympic games?  That party? Hummm..
@MatthewdAncona @Damage_13 @wallaceme @guardian Maybe its your assessment of my new party that is wrong, Matt?
“@Watforddogs: @DouglasCarswell @MisGrace You are odious-biting the hand of the people who developed you" <- RT the hate
@duncanrobinson you are kind. Thank you
@spignal @ravmattu @duncanrobinson @FT says Economist journalist
George takes charge of #Rochester campaign. What could possibly go wrong?  http://t.co/Cov1fB1a9Y
Bank crisis revealed big banks weren't good at banking. Anti-politics crisis shows established parties not very good at politics.
Westminster's #team2015 were bused into #rochester yesterday. If they lose, there won't be much of a team by the end of 2014.
Downing Street desperately asking around for anyone with an Eurosceptic ideas. Anyone got a clue? Anything?... #desperate #NotSerious
You know that knee jerk reaction by the PM to try to win the #Rochester by election? It's just talk ... http://t.co/80BT54ocdf
Govt's policy on EU migration looks like it hasn't been thought through because it hasn't. Desperate post-Clacton scramble. #NotSerious
Sunday papers show David Cameron desperately scrabbling about for new policies to appear EUsceptic and firm on immigration. #FourWastedYears
Janet Daley on appalling lack of accountability in NHS following Andrew Lansley's reforms | via @Telegraph http://t.co/vAtQXNciht
@politicsastar @bbcthisweek V kind. Thanks!
@MissV_est80 Awful. Local councillors should stick with the original plan. Not tag along with ministers demands for 12k more houses.
Sofa government has failed. Citizen consumers are fed up with it. Even @matthewdancona can see it  http://t.co/u7z4tGk72X
“@Michael_Heaver: UKIP polling record 24% with ComRes tonight” <- how's that Peak UKIP theory coming along?
Great article on green energy folly by @CharlesHMoore  http://t.co/u311H4YFl3
@SelfeJohn UKIP Chief Whip in the Commons is basically okay. For a whip...
@Tweets2CV I was having a quick chat with one of her colleagues
EU referendum vote in House of Commons. Few Lib Dems and Labour MPs. Half Conservatives. 100% UKIP attendance!
@barclaycards vote out Tendring councillors next May who went back on the initial local plan
Conservative intervention disintegrates into playground point scoring.... #onceGreatParty
I get to speak in EU debate. Some former colleagues still try to argue that PM's position is credible. #askRochester
Govt whips seem to be manoeuvring to prevent UKIP first MP from speaking in today's EU debate
@DiggeryWhiggery you are spot on
Waiting to speak in Commons debate on In Out EU referendum. Many speeches about case for voting in or out, rather than merits of referendum
@DiggeryWhiggery not yet
“@GuidoFawkes: I accept your challenge of a duel. @PeterJLuff” <- Cool!
@JoshMay_PH dunno.... ;0)
@barclaycards appalling, isn't it. So much for localism
The divisia index is the canary in the monetary mineshaft - as per my paper on monetary policy http://t.co/oe22dvw9la
After Osbrown?  http://t.co/oe22dvw9la
.@SJacksonMP @downingstreet will you be voting for the Euro Arrest Warrant?
@kingbagcarrier @ZacGoldsmith thanks Stephen!
@DavidT_York let's see eh....
Net migration into UK up by more than 38% to 243,000 http://t.co/Pg6oh9bCCd #JustAnotherFailedGovernment
"One last go" at EU migration curbs promises Mr Cameron. He's yet to try once after four years. #NotSerious http://t.co/ePDFV8Gu48
How many MP candidate selections did Matthew Parris preside over in Kent for the Conservative Party? We should be told
@ProfJCharmley thank you for your kind comments on the radio the other day...
@ProfJCharmley ah! Apologies. I understand. You make a good point
@ProfJCharmley read what I wrote John. Not what you perhaps imagined I wrote
These are the values of those at the top of today's Conservative party. This is how they think #LostTheirWay  http://t.co/yebs3jEqZg
It's the self pity of it all that is so remarkable. #MattParris #OnceGreatParty  http://t.co/yebs3jEqZg
@AGilinsky read his words, Alic.
Has Matt Parris ever been paid for presiding over Conservative candidate selection contests? We should be told http://t.co/yebs3jEqZg
How many times has Matthew Parris been a guest at Chequers or Downing St over the past couple of years? http://t.co/yebs3jEqZg
Matthew Parris. The gift that keeps on giving. Top Tory cheer leader seems to despise Britain today. #OnceGreatParty  http://t.co/yebs3jEqZg
.@Mike_Fabricant thank you, Michael. I value your advice on holding ministers to account
.@BBCPolitics so much for the fallacy that it's the constraints of coalition holding them back from real change....
@colonelstewart then quit following
@dizzy_thinks whips are generally petty. Others are good and honourable
Cameron's promises of EU reform have the credibility of a Greek govt bond. Like Greek bond, can only be redeemed on say so of Mrs Merkel
Ministers promise they'll toughen up rules on foreign criminals. What have they been doing for past four years? http://t.co/YrztrOE3NZ
Six years after first promising to scrap Inheritance Tax, Mr Cameron promising to cut it. Not serious about change http://t.co/2wzfxxqW30
Despite tough talk about Europe, David Cameron opts back into Euro Arrest Warrant. Not serious about change  http://t.co/bUMqJ01RYT
After four years of inaction and spin, PM scrabbling about for something on immigration and EU. Not credible http://t.co/tIeUa4zWnY
@SkyAnushka as per my resignation speech.
@SkyAnushka why the shift, eh?....
@SkyAnushka I think he came as close to saying "yes" as he could bear. Hints he no longer backs faux recall, and give us what he promised.
@ShneurOdzeUKIP thanks, my friend!
@andrewpolitics they must keep digging!
“@andrewpolitics: @DouglasCarswell asks PM re recall. PM agrees with principle and will look carefully at proposals” <- we have momentum!

.@patrickwintour @IsabelHardman not what he told the 22 in June
.@chrisshipitv will Mr Cameron meet any local voters, or do another behind the barricades visit like in Clacton?
@owenjbennett I've always personally got on with Dennis.

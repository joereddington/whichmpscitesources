@XrdYorks @WortleyMensClub it was a pleasure to be there, thanks for the invitation.
congrats to @AlanBillingsPCC a very worthy winner.  now the hard work starts, much to do to rebuild trust #SYPCC
mood y'day on doorstep very different from that encountered in May; people voted for a sensible candidate for a very serious role #SYPCC
@paulwaugh @Markfergusonuk not a FPTP election - in that context would not have been so close

wonderful concert tonight at Cutlers' Hall to celebrate 80th anniversary of Bolsterstone Male Voice Choir - here's to the next 80 years
every time Cameron is seen losing his temper in public, he looks more & more like a man no longer in control of events #EuropeanCouncil
@Jamie_S88 @ChukaUmunna lol, not a bad performance by the Owls but do wish we could put the ball in the back of the net! #swfc #uto
@The_ChrisShaw haha, you too.
@The_ChrisShaw Ladybower Inn is in Derbyshire
@The_ChrisShaw yes!
@The_ChrisShaw it's a great photo
@The_ChrisShaw Hathersage is in D'shire; Strines Moor is Yorkshire, with the boundary at Derwent Edge/Derwent Moor
@The_ChrisShaw before 2010 boundary change, it was well and truly within my Sheffield constituency!  It's definitely not Derbyshire
@The_ChrisShaw superb; but I think Strines is in Sheffield!
when is a recount not a recount?  when it's a bundle check.  better communications please from by-election counts! #HeywoodAndMiddleton
@lettimknow well done Tim, pleased to hear it
@alioldknow he needs to e-mail me or contact my office
@matrobinson88 that's why I'm not a photographer!  the views/landscapes that grab me very rarely impress when captured in a frame!
@matrobinson88 gr8 photo; was there on Sunday when the weather was glorious - it's a very special area
@AndrewRWhite I know; sheer laziness on my part
@IMcMillan @johnbroom1970 it really is :)  but cod is a wormy fish
@johnbroom1970 @IMcMillan it's enough of a variation that Barnsley folk eat cod! Grimbarians & Meggies know that haddock is better
@johnbroom1970 @AlanBillingsPCC http://t.co/B0ZT514QKb
very pleased to see @AlanBillingsPCC as Labour's candidate in the South Yorkshire #PCC by-election
@frederickJWill2 @LabourDefra @trussliz ...& no mention of affordable hsg, broadband or rural transport #cpc14
Nothing from @trussliz on water bills, natural environment, food fraud, MPZs #toryfail #cpc14
... think the Tories should be thanking Gordon Brown as much as anybody for saving the union #CPC14
Was pleased yesterday to attend the official opening of the Brammah gallery at Silkstone church #barnsleyisbrill
@elliereeves that's bang out of order - all NHS users should be treated with respect
@michaelj9 think it's the bigger version that has bent on some occasions?
@ZepStox well done and good luck
@ZepStox lol no!

@Markfergusonuk you're not the only one, Mark - it's happened to others too
a great piece from Will Hutton with some fascnating stats relating to the West Lothian Question  http://t.co/DcmsOz7ARA
@steviespuduk @UKLabour good - make sure you join the debate.  oh wait, you already have!
@steviespuduk exactly! need a public debate about how to devolve power. West Lothian Qn is about W'minster votes - nothing more than that
@steviespuduk you haven't answered my point about Eng Parl - it would be too big to work for all the regions of England
@steviespuduk @UKLabour that was some time ago & voters are much hungrier now for change ....
@steviespuduk @UKLabour need a redistribution of power to regions of England; twiddling with Westminster votes does nothing to achieve this
@steviespuduk @UKLabour separate Eng Parl will do little for northern regions; would still be utterly dominated by London & the S/East
.... but where is Clegg in all of this?  The position he & his party takes will be critical in all of this  #scotland2014 #englishdevolution
Cameron cannot be allowed to hold Scotland to ransom, in an effort to placate his own backbenchers ..... 1/2
after the exuberant debating spirit of the referendum, @BBCNewsnight falls back on aggressive, reductive interviewing technique #fail
#JoyceThacker has resigned from Rotherham council #rotherham
#FF @IrrancaDaviesMP @pamela_nash @SDoughtyMP @Vernon_CoakerMP @cllrstevewilson  all cracking No campaigners & the lovely people of Scotland
Scotland votes NO!  And the constitutional debate is only just beginning .... #indyref #bettertogether
if the No vote holds, then the real work begins ... a constitutional settlement for the whole of the UK & a fairer UK #bettertogether
got some sleep and the headline I was hoping to wake up to:  Scotland votes NO #bettertogether
YES!!!!  Clackmannanshire votes NO!
is the really big story tonight going to be the massive turnout?  and what we can learn from it about what is lacking in our democracy?
Lord Hennessy talking sense on BBC right now; UK needs to look at the constitution as a whole & needs a commission or convention
@steve_mccabe @bushbytiger yes; and last thing we need is a rushed, badly thought through constitutional settlement
@qprdave1234 @Markfergusonuk #englishdevolution debate not about more politicians, it's about redistributing power - decentralization
@tomriordan well said
@Markfergusonuk spot on; number of us tweeting about this tonight.  we need a hashtag - #Englishdevolution  #constitutionalconvention
we need a hashtag to organize the online debate on #Englishdevolution
@steve_mccabe spot on; we need a rigorous, open, public debate - no closed minds, no preconceived options that close down the discussion
debate about devolution in England should not be narrowly defined ie whether or not we have an English Parliament #englishdevolution
@suttonnick @jackconnor89 ... if  result is no, 1 debate closes & 2nd big debate begins: how best to devolve power across whole of the UK?
@Markfergusonuk mmmm .... you may be right
@Markfergusonuk if alarm is set, what do you think is the best time to get up for a meaningful sense of where it's going, Mark?  3am? 4am?
'The offering from the Yes camp is unscottish to me' @NEIL_OLIVER_ tells it how it is on #BBCNewsnight
Proud to be English.  Particularly proud to be a Northerner, heart & soul.  But more than anything, proud to be British.  #bettertogether
@bmac1906 @barton71 have spoken to a number of voters who have felt intimidated by tactics of some in the Yes campaign

No vote looking good I'm Airdrie http://t.co/cTPmIcwelG
@GeorgeFoulkes came across 76yr old lady y'day, No voter, who had been badly harassed by young male from Yes campaign - not acceptable!
Out in Airdrie today, overwhelming support for No campaign #bettertogether
The narrative of industrial decline in Scotland outlined on @BBCPanorama could just as easily be used to describe Northern England

@ianaste you could say that ...
@ianaste they think cyclists shouldn't be on road - but this BMW driver equally didn't want to make way for a car ambulance!
@ianaste we had exactly the same!  and from a BMW driver who looked as though he needed a bit of exercise ....
@ianaste exactly; arrogance of some car drivers is unbelievable
28 miles road biking up and down the hills of Sth Yorks. good stuff, but wish car drivers would think a bit more about cyclists on the road
@matrobinson88 'til I die.  and thanks, followed back!
@matrobinson88 really! would love to see successful pics then - it's no easy task, capturing the spirit of the Peak District hills
@matrobinson88 that pic is just superb!
@paulsalveson you're right there
@paulsalveson thanks Paul; I agree we have a lot in common with Scots - socially, economically; hence want Scots to stick with us
@paulsalveson I absolutely want real devolution for the north Paul - you know I do  - but within the context of the union
Please help support No Thanks, add a #Twibbon now! http://t.co/GwG1lncTOM http://t.co/in9z3XFqfp
@TobyFoster they're great people, warm and welcoming when they get to know you

I've just voted for Andrew George's #bedroomtax bill; we win the vote with huge majority, let's hope the Govt listens & acts accordingly

@alstewitn it's worrying for politics in general!
@steve_hawkes @PaulBrandITV true and by-elections don't always follow patterns seen in Gen Elections - notoriously unpredictable
@PoliticalQuaker @Callaghan2015 @politicshome wouldn't bet on any outcome - but it looks as though we will soon find out
@politicshome @PoliticalQuaker didn't a Tory MP in previous Parliament defect to UKIP?
@bphillipsonMP @PatGlassMP congrats!  what a lovely pic
has the BBC moderator retired for the night?  #indyref
such a turn off; BBC moderator needs to do his job - just a slanging match with  Salmond ensuring that Darling didn't get answers #indyref
@PeakDistrictUK spot on; exactly what we need - improved transport links between Manchester & Sheffield which don't damage Peak Park
@AnnaTEvans @lukepottermusic @TJWrigglesworth will do!
@AnnaTEvans @lukepottermusic @TJWrigglesworth congrats!  we didn't know x

@BarbaraHoll1 @Wentworth_house @jonnieirwin @LondonFreemen Rotherham & indeed the UK's best kept secret. needs restoring to its former glory

So Bob Kerslake, as a civil servant, hasn't performed well enough, but Ian Duncan Smith, as a politician, deserves to keep his job? Really?
Bob Kerslake axed as head of Civil Service? Astonishing. Worked with Bob for 9yrs when he was CEO of Sheffield Council - a 1st class officer
@KyleButcher ... I think not; hugely looking forward to seeing @angelaeagle sparring with William Hague
@TomDunn89 @angelaeagle yes
William Hague (Rotherham) v @angelaeagle (Sheffield).  Business of the House in future will have a distinctive South Yorkshire flavour ...

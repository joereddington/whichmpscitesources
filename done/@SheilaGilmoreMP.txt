@IainTaylor2014 Thanks Iain. Tue Mar 31 14:45:08 BST 2015
@IainTaylor2014 OK well I'm not going to convince you, but you must at least admit we have very different policies to Tories? Tue Mar 31 14:26:35 BST 2015
@IainTaylor2014 But we said we'd introduce a min wage in 97. And did. We said we'd introduce a Scots Parl. And did. Mean nothing to you? Tue Mar 31 14:14:25 BST 2015
@IainTaylor2014 Why won't we? Tue Mar 31 14:03:05 BST 2015
@portyalliance Hello - what's your name and I'll search my inbox. I make a point of replying to all emails so keen to do so here. Tue Mar 31 14:01:47 BST 2015
@IainTaylor2014 And we'd raise min wage, ban zero hours contracts, guarantee jobs for unemployed and scrap bedroom tax - Tories wouldn't! Tue Mar 31 13:58:34 BST 2015
@IainTaylor2014 Hi Ian. Tories are against EU, tackling climate change, international aid and human rights - we support all of these. Tue Mar 31 13:58:01 BST 2015

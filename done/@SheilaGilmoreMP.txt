@Bigscout None but all intercity services on West Coast line removed, freeing up space for commuters in placed like Watford and Northampton.
Only alternatives to HS2 are more roads or short-haul flights. For those who understand benefits of rail, HS2 is still the only answer:...
Reducing speed of HS2 would only reduce costs marginally, but reduce economic benefits significantly: http://t.co/uIMGFCCBiP
HS2 gives huge capacity boost without years of rail-replacement bus services on major intercity routes: http://t.co/uIMGFCCBiP
@CherylGillanMP @GeorgeFoulkes Trains will use HS2 and then run at conventional speeds on the WCML to Scotland. Time savings from phase one!
HS2 doesn't mean forsaking investment in existing lines. This is happening now, and will continue: http://t.co/uIMGFCCBiP
HS2 will boost Scottish economy and could attract people away from short-haul flights, reducing carbon emissions: http://t.co/uIMGFCCBiP
Ed Balls asked if HS2 best way to spend money. It is. 30 mins off Edin-London journey from 2026. Hour from 2033. http://t.co/uIMGFCCBiP

Only alternatives to HS2 are more roads or short-haul flights. If you support rail, HS2 is still the only answer: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
HS2 doesn't just go to Birmingham! Services continue to destinations on classic network, so Ed-London = 1 hr saving: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
If we reduce speed of HS2, costs are only slightly less but economic benefits drop significantly: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
HS2 takes intercity routes of classic network, so room for commuters and services to smaller towns and cities: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
HS2 less about speed, more about capacity. West Coast line is full, with no room for London-Blackpool service now: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
There's a law of diminishing returns on investment in classic network - HS2 offers better value for monety: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
HS2 will augment rather than distract from investment in classic network: http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw
Thanks to @LabourList for publishing my article in defence of HS2 earlier this week - http://t.co/IlU4Ihhdvw - it's still the only answer!

@leonc1963 @portsmouthnews @HilseaLido ..Hopeful new admin will do that. Asset transfer gave lido nothing. They've done it all themselves.
@leonc1963 @portsmouthnews @HilseaLido agree, always said PCC should recognise the community benefit and make a contribution......
@HilseaLido has done an amazing job to get pool back. Need lifeguards & our support. Their volunteers shouldn't have to put up with aggro.

2. Birmingham problem needs simple requirement that all public funded schools must offer open and welcome environment to all pupils.
1. Good debate on promoting British values but still fear Government's focus is on intervention, not supporting teachers to do it well.

@teachinggrid @StevenJones_MCR Thanks. Pleased to see you promoting this important debate.
@StevenJones_MCR true; but high fees waste £bns on debt cancellation. Lower fees make better use of public and private money.
@StevenJones_MCR 2. Can recoup more from well off graduates through tax as made clear. Desirable p'haps but not essential to lower fees.
@StevenJones_MCR 1. Low income graduates would pay less than now. Do we want them to pay more so rich can pay even more?
@teachinggrid @StevenJones_MCR Not clear why cutting cost of three year degree to £10k from £25k would hit the poor?

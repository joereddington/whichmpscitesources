@EmmaEHoward And me you! Hope the fundraising goes really well. And look up Camilla and Kids Co also. They do amazing work.
.@CliveEfford's #SaveTheNHS Bill passes by 241-18. Astonishing for Govt to barely turn up, but great victory for NHS users and staff.
Closure motion passes 239 to 20. Vote proper now underway; let's see how many Tories come out of the woodwork for this one! #SaveTheNHS
First vote on @CliveEfford's Bill to #SaveTheNHS has begun. There's still time for you to back it too http://t.co/dHihfzJkIC
2/2 They wanted to sit next to @CliveEfford for his NHS Bill. So we all had to move! Sitting next to Clive won't detoxify them over NHS!
Me and @EmmaLewellBuck had a mexican stand off with Reckless and Carswell as they jumped in our seats when we went to vote. 1/2
@JuneOSullivan @cypnowawards @thedeniseb Ditto to you two too! Was a great night such amazing people.  All so deserving of winning!

Fantastic victory in the Lords for fans as #putfans1st amendment passes! Well done to all concerned. Let's hope the Gov now listen at last!
I'm in the Chamber hoping to catch the Speaker's eye at #PMQs
@DRLT @christopherhope why aren't the leaves allowed to fall naturally as nature intended #slighlyconfused
Govt defeated on #NewClause2 by 284 to 269! Great victory for the #fairdeal4yourlocal campaign and will be big boost for local pubs.
Voting now for a #fairdeal4yourlocal with #NewClause2. Strong cross-party support for measures to bring fairness to pub-brewery relationship
@JoelBakerMusic yes all well, great look forward to it.

@Jon_Proctor92 Yes he can re-take his place in society but not everyone can walk back into their former job after committing certain crimes
.@jeffers249 Exactly! I've written to HMRC to make this point and they don't seem interested sadly!
@StandbackLiza @jeffers249 this proves there are measures artists can take if they want to try and #putfansfirst
@jeffers249 @StandbackLiza I agree with you I wouldn't pay them either. Fans shd be brave and boycott these sites then they'd be the losers!
.@jeffers249 @StandbackLiza if anything I think Govt may lose revenue due to this practice ie are powersellers paying tax on their income?
@StandbackLiza @jeffers249 Yes touts and secondary sites are the big winners and fans the losers. Esp fans who end up paying these prices!
Would also expect other patrons & advertisers to follow @CharlieCW's lead if SUFC continue to promote Ched Evans & take no action on chants
.@CliveEfford, @CliveBettsMP and I discussed Ched Evans issue with FA's Heather Rabbatts last week. FA need to act if SUFC persist in this
.@CharlieCW absolutely right to make a stand against Sheff Utd stance on Ched Evans. Clubs as well as players have resp to be role models
.@StandbackLiza #fleetwoodmac I know it is so unfair and it has to be stopped and I'm still trying to make Parliament legislate to stop it.

@stettip free bus travel to age 16 & is valid til 30/9 to overcome this 'gap' even this small extension would help. I will take this up. 3/3
@stettip when they have to basically pay full adult fare at 16 which is crazy as you say. In London kids get a pass which gives them 2.5/3
@stettip students cards which help but these can't be purchased til they start 6th form/college in Sept so worst period is 31/7 til sept 2/3

@kuz_mann I learnt from Iraq that  military action must have plan to follow up and build future  this action from sky not enough & no plan
@mrkoampah  NO "EU judges"decide ECHR cases, much wider covering over 40 countries. Britain led the world to create human rights standards
I am sorry I mistyped Alan Hennings name, but horrified angry and sad that he has been murdered.
@stucrow @jameschappers not At all I didn't support action because I did not think there was a plan which would work I tweeted out of anger
@mrkoampah uk lawyers drafted convention and by bringing the convention into our law in 1998 we gave British judges jurisdiction
The vile murderers of ISIL make me almost wish I  voted to bomb in Iraq last week. I want to avenge the death of Alan Hemming I despise them
#bbctoday human rights convention is NOT a creation of the EU but the broader council of Europe. Grayling whips up ignorant prejudice.
@andybolton you misunderstand that tweet was intended as a description of Tory policy which is economically ignorant, divisive and cruel
Restrain public sector pay, freeze benefits, cut police to boost incomes of the few whose incomes haven't yet  been reduced by Tory gov't
Tories briefing will cut taxes after deficit ended, which they say will be 2018. In 2010 they said by 2015 *so not in next parliament then.
Cameron asserts "under this government there are fewer children in poverty" not true but how does he justify claim

@DavidDurant they hate all women and turn them into sex slaves so I see no point in asking ISIL barbarians why they hate yazidis Kurds or us
Most MPs clear bombing needed to stop ISIL. Last night constituents more unsure. I not sure.  Galloway makes me want to bomb, but what then?
@DavidDurant like what
@DavidDurant if we listen to people in fear in Iraq we will send bombers. That would create temporary relief but would worse horror follow?
@LindseyCape @macmillancancer @vincecable rest of us cancelled to be in parliament to vote on military action tho we support #CoffeeMorning

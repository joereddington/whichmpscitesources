Amazed that Theresa May has not written to Met Police Commissioner giving an answer as to whether he can use the 250k water cannons
@CommonsHomeAffs hearing evidence from Alison Millar, Peter Saunders and Hilary Willmer on historic child abuse
It is absurd that there is to be no vote on the European Arrest Warrant today. Three Parliamentary Committees have recommended this. #eaw

@Ty_Duarte Actually if you read the speech you will see that is not true.
@Hp46N. Sorry I don't understand I think Gibralta is a wonderful country.
I have also written to The Home Secretary about the Home Office role in the appointment process

@anytimefrances it is not "favoured" if you contact your MP he or she will act. That's why they are there to act for their constituents.
@anytimefrances. I agree the quality of service should be the same. People are desperate so they contact their mps.
@GirlSummit. Note the HASC report into FGM published two weeks ago. Action needs to follow.#GirlSummit

Examples about passport concerns should be sent to the  HASC office before the appearance of the Head of the Passport Office next Tuesday
@BermondseyBeach. Nonsense. HASC accepted the report in good faith( redacted) then the entire report was leaked to the BBC. Not good.

Fed members upset by tone of Home Secretary's speech. They should have first opportunity to vote  #pfewconf14
@JoeThorpe1963. Excellent send me a pic.
Tough speech from Home Secretary goes further than Normington Review and HASC.  #pfewconf14
Legacy speech from Home Secretary. The vision has always been there, but we need to carry people with us when executing change. #pfewconf14

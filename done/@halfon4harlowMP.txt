Amazing, Miliband ignores deficit reduction,& huge growth in jobs& big decrease in unemployment under Conservatives #LongTermEconomicPlan
Sad that free world having to go to war again to defeat extreme Islamist Terror.Huge respect to brave USA Armed Personnel for their efforts.
@CllrWaidaForman was Labour who signed huge unsustainable Private Finance Contracts PFI wth big business,leading to many probs today.
Miliband: rejection of Conservative pledge of In-Out Referendum on EU
Miliband seemingly rejects #EnglishVotesforEnglishLaws. Would rather have Lab bloc of Scottish MPs voting on only English legislation
Miliband says duty on NHS,forgets Lab mid-Staff +extra 3000 nurses under Govt, extra 850,000 operations a year, 19,000 less managerial posts
Miliband talks  apprentices-but under Govt, more than 1.5 million apprenticeship starts. 860,000 apprentices in 2012/13. Harlow up by 84%
Miliband says vulnerable 'on their own'. Yet he & Labour voted against Govt fuel duty freeze,Council Tax freeze & tax cuts 4 lower earners
Miliband spks on lower wages 4 lower earners, yet he & Labour voted agnst Conservative-led Govt raising tax threshold 4 lower earners 2 £10k
@myharlow  please kindly provide me with evidence by email of this happening and I will contact schools to ask why.

@Sean_Howlett @Phones4u that may be the case but not the case with all. Mostly @Phones4U cheaper. Need variety not just 1 or providers
@Sean_Howlett if big players Vodafone only allow u to buy direct frm them, means more expensive contracts. @Phones4U was generally cheaper
@chrishawtree @DJSkelton @Phones4u issue is whether we are moving to stage where u can only buy mobiles direct frm providers =more expensive

@realperidot54 Yes - I have done so. Mon Apr 27 14:43:13 BST 2015
@discovery77_ Yes, I agree with the need for a review and that the decision should be taken in open court with a jury. Sun Apr 26 15:39:26 BST 2015
@KimSnape @CllrCritchley Thanks Kim - great to see you. Sat Apr 25 21:00:10 BST 2015
Thanks to all who came campaigning for @robert_a_sharpe & me in Walkden South today, especially good to see @KimSnape http://t.co/w56udnjZQN Sat Apr 25 19:01:56 BST 2015
@Bridgeanne @rosiecosy I agree. Support and care should be there to free young Carers from caring. Sat Apr 25 00:30:19 BST 2015

@helnf In Irlam. We are meeting lots of people on the doorstep to answer Qs, can you email your address via http://t.co/PhAzVNntLu for that? Fri Apr 17 10:34:52 BST 2015
@helnf Candidates not able to attend event on 14th so not part of discussion. Maybe better if candidate views had been taken into account. Thu Apr 16 21:57:34 BST 2015
@helnf also I will be taking part in a panel style hustings in the constituency on Wednesday 22nd Thu Apr 16 21:46:30 BST 2015
@helnf I haven't dropped out at short notice - I have issues with the venue & format of event which I raised months ago but no changes made Thu Apr 16 21:43:43 BST 2015

@militant25 Not an assessment. Identifying #carers means helping refer them to sources of advice, help & support when they start caring. Tue Apr 14 21:36:04 BST 2015
@militant25 Key point is duty needs to be on NHS organisations NOT local authorities e.g. Carers of ppl with cancer have no contact with LAs Tue Apr 14 21:24:48 BST 2015
@MendingTheGap Not surprised - Conservatives have done little for carers over last 5 years but reduced services & caused stress & worry Tue Apr 14 20:30:42 BST 2015

@ChristianLyth Format of the event in shopping centre is the problem - have suggested changes, hope they can take on board. Tue Apr 14 20:13:09 BST 2015
@MissAnnette Format of the event in shopping centre is problem - most hustings are in church halls/schools. Have suggested changes to format Tue Apr 14 20:11:56 BST 2015

@elainem76 @mrsnickyclark so many #carers and #youngcarers give so much. We need to recognise that & give much more support, not cuts Fri Mar 27 22:37:57 GMT 2015
@sunnysalfordgrl 1 million #carers have given up work or cut their hours in order to care. Enough hardship, how can they add to it? Fri Mar 27 22:13:25 GMT 2015
Appalled that Government would consider reducing #carers eligibility for Carers Allowance. So shabby, even for Tories http://t.co/t5P1IGtQQJ Fri Mar 27 22:07:01 GMT 2015

@JenWilliamsMEN indeed. Replay and see the difference in handling interview/ haranguing/ relevance if questions asked. Thu Mar 26 23:17:29 GMT 2015
@JenWilliamsMEN we were discussing leaders' interview. I suggested you replay to assess balance of way that Paxman & Burley handled sessions Thu Mar 26 23:13:14 GMT 2015
@JenWilliamsMEN didn't notice that came up in the programme tonight. Thu Mar 26 23:08:18 GMT 2015
@JenWilliamsMEN Paxman decided Qs. He could have asked about NHS/social care/representing older people which audience obvs cared about. Thu Mar 26 23:05:40 GMT 2015
@JenWilliamsMEN invite you to replay interview and count how much Paxman intervened on & harangued Ed vs same in interview with Cameron Thu Mar 26 23:02:35 GMT 2015
Why is Kay Burley putting so many questions to Ed Miliband herself? Such obvious bias. #Battle4Number10 Thu Mar 26 21:56:43 GMT 2015
Cameron so clearly does not understand what his Govt has done to #socialcare - £3.5 billion cuts, ILF closed. #Battle4Number10 Thu Mar 26 21:38:20 GMT 2015
Cameron gives weak answer to Q about appointing Minister for Older People. Essential to focus on this group & their needs #Battle4Number10 Thu Mar 26 21:30:29 GMT 2015

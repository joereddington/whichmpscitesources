I have requested public meeting in #Salford on roadworks on A580 & been told that @urbanvision_uk @SalfordCouncil @OfficialTfGM will do this
@Debbie_abrahams asks excellent Q at PMQs about state of Child Adolescent Mental Health services criticised in report of Health Select Cttee
@samjaneburgess @LeanneSparkes Very imp. that @urbanvision_uk understand how roadworks are affecting ppl. - How long added to your journey?
@LeanneSparkes @urbanvision_uk I agree - I know it is awful. I have never supported the Busway & I am now calling for an Independent Review
@adamkidson_ I raise many issues about nurses pay and safe staffing - & Dennis Skinner had just asked Q about pay for nurses and midwives
@09EA63 I know it is bad. I am passing on complaints. I have asked @OfficialTfGM @urbanvision_uk for an Independent Review of the roadworks
44 years after Equal Pay Act, women in the North West earn 82p compared to every £ a man earns. Working for no pay from today #equalpayday
@vb24aw @andyburnhammp @urbanvision_uk I have asked Urban Vision and TfGM for an independent review of works on the Busway.
Just asked IDS if he agrees with exempting 60,000 #carers from the unfair #bedroomtax  - His answer indicated he doesn't think so
@PdunnPaula @urbanvision_uk 
I agree - it is horrendous. I will keep pressing for action.
@vb24aw @urbanvision_uk I agree, have never supported this Busway. Traffic queues to cross East Lancs seem worse in the last week or so.
I have reported to @urbanvision_uk  that traffic is backing up on Walkden Road either side of East Lancs Road, asked them to investigate/fix
@wintonwanderers Hope the match goes well.
@imperialcollege Thank you. It will be good to learn if there is full transparency and valid consent for all human tissue used.
@wintonwanderers would have been great if I could be there, but I work in Westminster from Monday to Thursday. Hope to see a future match.

@kevpeel that's not the vote from each area Kev. Ought to be an opt-in to command popular support.
@JenWilliamsMEN let's see then
@JenWilliamsMEN not mixing ideas here. 1. How can council leaders agree to mayor as part of devolution? 2. More likely mayor wd be from Mcr
@JenWilliamsMEN @kevpeel just think that unlikely. Surprised that this has been "agreed" without a vote on the idea
@JenWilliamsMEN @kevpeel never said anything about person being Labour. Would be an elected role,
@kevpeel @jenwilliamsmen would be astonished if GM elected mayor came from Bolton, Oldham or Tameside. And it appears this already agreed.
@kevpeel @jenwilliamsmen doubt that applies to others Kev.
@JenWilliamsMEN @kevpeel think that Manchester would expect elected Mayor to be from Manchester. Just saying - would they support if not?
@kevpeel @jenwilliamsmen wonder if ppl from Manchester would support an elected GM mayor from Oldham or Salford. Doubt it somehow.
Looking forward to seeing film made by young #carers in #salford tonight, film made in partnership with @The_Lowry
@caulfieldr @michaellcrick but I think they would vote against G Mcr Elected Mayor if asked
@JenWilliamsMEN somehow doubt that elected mayor for Greater Manchester will appeal across the 10 authorities
@horatioharry It is part of the business for that day, I hope it will get time for debate.

I would pay the nurses what their independent pay review body recommended. For #fairness and #patientsafety

I supported introduction by @DianaJohnsonMP of Bill in Commons 2day on important subject of Sex and Relationship Education. Tory MPs opposed
@andrew_barratt I will look into that.
@ChristianLyth agree absolutely. We need train service improvements more than this Busway.
MT @FCUnitedMcr: Just about to start the FC Minithon. Good turnout and still dry. < hope it goes well, can't join you as foot still injured
@andrew_barratt yes I have been reading it. Really shows how totally fed-up people are with the whole project.
@ChristianLyth I think you'll find that Lib Dem & Conservative Cllrs supported Busway when they were in control of Transport Authority.
@ChristianLyth that would be my preferred option. I have never supported Leigh Guided Busway. Terrible waste of public money.

@StevenHMcIntosh sorry spelled your name wrong. Long day but great result.
@StevenHMcIntosh Thanks Stephen for your help with the Bill. Really appreciate it.
@bernadette42020 I moved introducing the Bill, Tory MP David Nuttall spoke against it, we had a vote which we won by 204 for & 8 against

@LetToysBeToys  Apparently @Tesco think their ELC range with only boys as doctors is OK because packaging "does not specify a gender" Views?
@Tesco I think that a weak response. Packaging shows only boy as doctor. Can you get me a more considered answer from person responsible?
@UnaSummerson @ContactAFamily Thanks
@onmybiketoo understand that point. It should have been understood by Govt
@SalfREACH @parliamentors @salforduni thanks for letting me know. Hope it is going well.
@Tesco no answer to Tweets? 
girls can be beauticians but only boys can be doctors? Disappointing @LetToysBeToys http://t.co/QaqCogTKd3
@doufous @CoombesMostyn A Labour Govt will abolish Bedroom Tax - my Bill is to bring help to #carers by exempting them from #BedroomTax now.
@Simplicitly @pamibells Bill wd exempt those eligible for Carers Allowance & where overnight care needed & Labour will abolish Bedroom Tax
Working on my speech for Tuesday when I hope to introduce a Bill to exempt unpaid family #carers from the #BedroomTax
@wintonwanderers Thanks - would like to visit when girls team playing. Very keen to promote sport for girls and women.
@wintonwanderers Hope you find an assistant. Good if I could come to see you play on one of your match days.

@GregBroadhurst @mndcampaigns @mndassoc Thanks Greg. Happy to support this campaign for people living with #MND and their carers
@RolandsDelectus thanks
@RolandsDelectus I want to champion #carers who shd always have been exempt. I voted for @AndrewGeorgeLD Bill but LDs voted for Bedroom Tax
@RolandsDelectus Labour pledged to abolish Bedroom Tax if elected in 2015. Carers a priority as caring workload means can't earn to pay it.
@1963JFK @CllrCritchley Planning to ask for a public meeting to discuss issues caused by works on A580. Will put out details when fixed.
So Lib Dem Conference votes against scrapping unfair Bedroom Tax. On Oct 14th I will bring forward Bill to exempt #carers from Bedroom Tax.
@MrsJo_P @wlasinclair OK - lots of issues in Salford too, people getting increasingly fed up. Interested to know how your meeting goes.

@johnhemmingmp
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister indeed which is why the case was value for money in the public interest.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister The point, however, additionally is that only a minority are actually published.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister However, a judgment from 2007 should be public and hence if you send it to me I will publish
@bomber_55 @fbunational the link is updated
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister previously you said getting judgments was easy.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister The rules, however, were still that it should be in public. Can I have it please.
@bomber_55 @fbunational The EDM that you link to give a list of signatories (which includes me)
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @RickySeal @pibarrister it worked, may I have the judgment from 2007 please
@SVPhillimore @RickySeal @wizardpc @pibarrister It achieved the objective.  Where are your judgments?
@SVPhillimore @RickySeal @wizardpc @pibarrister where are the public judgments then?
@SVPhillimore @RickySeal @wizardpc @pibarrister have you acted in any committal hearings for contempt?
@SVPhillimore @RickySeal @wizardpc @pibarrister I happen to think that secret imprisonment is something that must be challenged. You don't.
@RickySeal @SVPhillimore @wizardpc @pibarrister eg The Judicial Press office denied what the court accepted in the judgment (para 44)
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @rhobbs42 @RickySeal @pibarrister I think it is an important issue, clearly you do not.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @rhobbs42 @RickySeal @pibarrister True and possibly more.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @rhobbs42 @RickySeal @pibarrister Indeed I have tried the other avenues.  It is a complex constitutional question.

I once had a job driving a white van, but I don't "feel respect" when I see one.  It's a tool for doing a job, not a mystical being.
@SVPhillimore @wizardpc @rhobbs42 @RickySeal @pibarrister It was a mechanism to get the court to consider large numbers of missing judgments

@martingeorge It was added to not just reiterated.   I did give the details.
@martingeorge @mmpolista i) is modified, iii) is new and iv) is a new comment.  Para 25 also now gives an authority for getting the order.
@martingeorge @mmpolista Actually 48 adds materially to the guidance and is also a good para.
@mmpolista This is a surreal suggestion.  If Bailii don't have the judgments what can they do?
@mmpolista Given that the government say it is an issue for the courts how else can I do this.
@mmpolista 44 is a bigger number than 23
@mmpolista Keep going.  Try para 44.
@mmpolista Did you get as far as the later paragraphs.
@MarkLewisLawyer The judicial press office denied it was true.
@MarkLewisLawyer The government, however, believe it is an issue for judiciary.
@MarkLewisLawyer 44 In respect of my general attacks "every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs."
@mmpolista Read the whole judgment http://t.co/pCJfXcW4mO
@dr_rita39 @MarkLewisLawyer I still don't think making babies breathe carbon monoxide is an ethical experiment.
@MarkLewisLawyer read the whole of the judgment
@MarkLewisLawyer because you criticised a successful attempt to highlight and change the status quo.
@MarkLewisLawyer another lawyer who is happy with the status quo where people are imprisoned without published judgements.
@olliehyams Mr Hemming's point is that for a very large number of these committals there is no judgment to be found on BAILII.
@olliehyams So you think it is OK to have lots of people imprisoned without scrutiny?  Have you read para 44?

@AcocksGreenFG @jessphillips I think there was one both in 1997 and 2001 at St Giles.
@jessphillips @rhysmogs @SaileshPyPatel Combined with blog posts it does work.  Without those it is limited by the number of characters.
@jessphillips @rhysmogs @SaileshPyPatel  You miss the point. This is a more public debate than a debate where were are in the same room.
@AmyJStout Only subsequent to this judgment. Please read it and try to  understand it.  It is worthwhile.  Para 25.
@AmyJStout I take it you haven't read para 44.
@bordesleygreen @jessphillips @neilelkes I don't mind.
@AmyJStout I don't think trying to stop people being locked up in secret is spurious.  It is am important protection of civil liberties.
@AmyJStout It enables me to  JR the SoS on his duty to support the rule of law.  That is the key issue.
@jessphillips @SaileshPyPatel I have emailed you about this.  Probably easier to do it jointly.
@AmyJStout Because I needed to raise the concern about judges not following proper procdure.  Which I did and which caused changes to occur.
@jessphillips @SaileshPyPatel There wasn't actually a hustings in 2010 although there was one for previous elections.
@julie_doughty Why is jailing people in secret acceptable?
@AmyJStout Why is jailing people in secret acceptable?
@rhobbs42 Why is jailing people in secret acceptable?
@jessphillips @SaileshPyPatel We should arrange it jointly or via an independent third party.
@SaileshPyPatel @jessphillips that's one way.
@jessphillips We are having a public debate on twitter, but I don't mind having one in person - as long as there is a record.
@jessphillips Twitter is a public debate even if limited in size of messages.  I prefer to have a record of debates. In person should be OK.
@jessphillips Look at France.  Labour's policies would lead to greater cuts in public services because of higher on sov. debt int. rates.
@simonburrows23 I took it up to challenge the process of secret imprisonment and have achieved important changes in guidance.
@jessphillips We are delivering free child care for 3 and 4 year olds plus 40% (ish) of 2 year olds.  Where is that factually wrong?
@simonburrows23 @pibarrister Its about the imprisonment of people in secret for contempt of court "a very concerning state of affairs" CoA
@jessphillips On the NHS we can look at Labour delivery in Wales http://t.co/kaUHQiE4he
@jessphillips The country was close to bankruptcy because of Labour failures.  All delivery after such a mess is good.
@debbieshanahan @connumdrum @DrAndrewWatt @birminghammail It is only exposable if it is true.  There needs to be evidence.
@jessphillips the money needs to be found in each year's budget to deliver it every year. Not just in the first year. It is a revenue item.
@jessphillips @jae2702 the provision started in 2006 but was delivered after 2010 by the government rescuing the country from Labour's mess
@DrAndrewWatt @birminghammail I don't know.
@DrAndrewWatt @birminghammail Such thoughts, however, would really need some evidence.  The 3rd Bomb question is important.
@jae2702 @jessphillips It does, the coalition have added to free childcare. 40% of two year olds plus more as well as the 3&4 from 2006.
@1st_Barrister http://t.co/wQMrsyEtyV
@RickySeal @pibarrister No I have already done lots of other things.  These issues are left to the judiciary (in my view wrongly).
@RickySeal @pibarrister What would you do then?
@TimGclaw The recognition that most judges are not following the guidance is IMO relevant.
@TimGclaw Twitter is not a good medium for debating such issues http://t.co/pCJfXcW4mO
@TimGclaw However, the previous guidance has not worked.
@TimGclaw Unlike you I know the details of previous guidance and how this judgment addst to that.
@bordesleygreen @dnotice2012 Thank you for this.
@pibarrister To me I appear to have made progress in stopping people being jailed in secret.  I am not the only person who takes that view.
@TimGclaw What comment do you have on paras 44 and 48.
@pibarrister @JCanlin My objective is to stop people being jailed in secret rather than getting lots of technical paperwork right.
@bordesleygreen @dnotice2012 It remains, however, that in the last week someone has been subjected to a super injunction against a petition.
@bordesleygreen @dnotice2012 Thank you for this.  Hopefully after Friday's judgment it will stop being unseen and unscritinised.
@TimGclaw @JCanlin Para 44 is a lot later.  Try reading that.
@NobleSammynoble @bluebell161005 @BraveKidsVoices It needs evidence rather than hearsay.
@TimGclaw @JCanlin It is worth reading the whole of the judgment before commenting.  It is about a systemic issue not a single case.
@Familoo @JCanlin 44 Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs.
@TimGclaw @JCanlin 44 Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs.
@nearlylegal @Uncivil_S The critical time point is the application date.  I thought you would know that.
@nearlylegal I still managed to get most of what I was aiming for (and spoke about at the hearing) http://t.co/pCJfXcW4mO
@dnotice2012 @bordesleygreen Not if you understand my objective which is to stop secret jailings.
@dnotice2012 @bordesleygreen The selection does not misrepresent and it required by twitter. http://t.co/pCJfXcW4mO
@dnotice2012 @bordesleygreen As a journalist said. I lost a battle, but won the war.
@JCanlin @pibarrister   44 Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs.
@nearlylegal @Uncivil_S It wasn't published at the time of application to the administrative court.  D'oh.
@nearlylegal  Para 44 Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs.
@dnotice2012 @bordesleygreen   Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs
@1st_Barrister Para 44 Mr Hemming's point [...] every indication is that unhappily it is true, is a very concerning state of affairs.
@NobleSammynoble @bluebell161005 @BraveKidsVoices I don't have any evidence relating to this or allegations relating to deaths in the UK.
@politicalhackuk @LabourList @peterkyle Even if their interpretation is right and I don't think it is.  How are they "gagged"?
@CathyAshley Try understanding what it was about.  It was never about the individual case, it is about locking people up in secret.

@jessphillips The same principle applies to the £10,000 tax free allowance. I agree that there was a tax free allowance previously.
@jessphillips I agree that some things were done in the previous parliament, but I am still doing research. (actually asking others)
@jessphillips https://t.co/BiJ2MiwlpF refers to Sept 2010
@jessphillips The government websites say it was delivered in this parliament, but I am getting the details checked out.
@jessphillips My understanding is that there is free child care for all 3 and 4 year olds and ~40% of 2 year olds - more than before
@jessphillips I do think it is clear that we are delivering this (and more) at the moment.  However, I will get more details.
@DouglasCarswell @SeanH119 I agree.  UKIP are not the same as the BNP or NF.
@TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk @jessphillips It has worked elsewhere.  However, in the end it is having a service that matters.
@politicalhackuk @jessphillips @TheIanCruise Could you please source this?
@TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk @jessphillips You can have a franchise in the same location.
@TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk @jessphillips This is the petition http://t.co/hAf9sty3p6  no mention of franchising or crown.
@jessphillips @jonwalker121 @neilelkes This is what the BBC say http://t.co/vqeov86x1j
@politicalhackuk @jessphillips @TheIanCruise If a resident in Acocks Green wants to go to the Acocks Green Post Office there will be one.
@politicalhackuk @jessphillips @TheIanCruise In other words the proposal is to move the post office service.  Not to close it down.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise   There is a difference between losing a service and closing a service.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise It is a policy I support.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise http://t.co/vqeov86x1j
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise From  the constituents' perspective the office is proposed to move.  A move which I oppose for reasons in the pt
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise it is the dishonesty of claiming that the office is to be closed that I dislike.  The proposal is to move it.
@TheIanCruise In the end the definite article fitted within the space limit and I felt it was, therefore, warranted.
@TheIanCruise @jessphillips  I do think there are problems with the suggested move for the reasons in the petition.  It is, however, a move.
@TheIanCruise @jessphillips I believe that it is my constituents' perception that matters.  An open post office is an open post office.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk There is a proposal to move the office - which should not be misrepresented as a closure.
@Joannalane62 True and the general abuse of procedure.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk And, it just so happens, that the trend of closures has halted. http://t.co/uHCyIbEOxj
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk What matters is to keep the services not whether or not they are franchised.
@jessphillips @TheIanCruise @politicalhackuk This is not about franchising.  It is about what is best for Acocks Green.
@TheIanCruise @jessphillips @politicalhackuk I am not opposing the franchising aspect.  I am opposing the detailed proposal.  This is clear.
@Joannalane62 What is important about this case is the harm that the state action is doing.
@TheIanCruise @jessphillips @politicalhackuk Nonsense.  I am not opposing Franchising in principle, but instead the specific proposal.
@politicalhackuk @AcocksGreenFG @TheIanCruise @jessphillips Which is protecting the total numbers of post offices.

@TeachAndMark Early demolition of the building contaminating the school is the obvious priority.  It needs to happen quickly.
@just_standing2 @shinybluedress a case where more information is needed
@TeachAndMark I presume it is registered land against which the costs can be enforced through a forced sale.
@TeachAndMark you are right that this is the top priority. There is no sense having a recontamination of the school after reopening.
@TeachAndMark I presume the site owner could be charged for this if they don't do it.
@TeachAndMark the council should invite the school to their meetings about the issue.
Sadly it appears at the moment that @YardleysSchool will not be opening on Monday as yet.   I raised the issue in the House this morning.

@C_P_Resource @CathyAshley @HackneyChild @martinnarey @Brigid39 @Harr_Ferguson The system never comments about individual cases.

@I_am_peevee @Girl_Interrupt_ @martinnarey You are clearly not following the trends.  Look at Lashin v Russia.
@I_am_peevee @Girl_Interrupt_ @martinnarey Sadly I am right.  However, only time will tell.
@jfb_smoggy @martinnarey Ofsted refuse to give me the records.
@Girl_Interrupt_ @I_am_peevee @martinnarey Most of the experts are employed by the local authority and can be fired for recommending reunion
@I_am_peevee @martinnarey The argument is that adoption numbers should increase.  The argument requires evidence.  But undermines opinion.
@jfb_smoggy @martinnarey Exactly Martin Narey has been the cheer leader for placing for adoption even if there is no-one to adopt.
@martinnarey My statement is entirely accurate as is my advice.
@I_am_peevee @martinnarey Sadly that is not true.  See Lashin v Russia to understand the legal problem.
@MotherGFatherG @martinnarey MGFG is right why create so many statutory orphans?
@martinnarey Yes, but you personally have driven up the numbers placed for adoption without anywhere for them to go.  Why?
@martinnarey that is not an annual number.  The question is how many children pa.  Partially your errors cause so many children to wait.
@martinnarey What number of adoptions (from care) do you think would be enough?

@AcocksGreenFG @a_treaclemine Has this issue been referred to my office?  If not can you please email me about it?
@a_treaclemine @AcocksGreenFG @politicalhackuk As I understand it it is the green sacks particularly that the council refuses to collect.
@politicalhackuk @jae2702 Who is Paul Dransfield.  Basically he has to report on the budget to say whether or not he things it will balance.
@jae2702 I don't think so. I am no longer part of running the council though.  That stopped in 2012.   We always worked on the end of Feb.
@jae2702 This gives a reasonable summary of the rules http://t.co/FZ8cqIxSgL time is needed to issue council tax bills.

@jae2702 @politicalhackuk it is not submitted or authorised by government.
@politicalhackuk We did check that this was possible.  It pays for a weekly rubbish collection and is being used for wheelie bins.
@politicalhackuk the money from the government for waste collection could have been used rather than funding wheelie bins.

@politicalhackuk @a_treaclemine It is under the 1990 act that the statutory duty arises to clear litter.
@politicalhackuk We have to have an adequate service.  Birmingham has much more money per household than Solihull.
@politicalhackuk This, however is the 2013 budget not 2012.  You set that budget.  Nationally Labour say more cuts are coming.
@a_treaclemine @politicalhackuk That might be a sensible approach.  It is, however, the councils statutory duty to remove the bags of leaves
@politicalhackuk It must, however, be the first time a council has put "sorry" stickers on the bags.
@politicalhackuk still picking up the bags is better than putting "sorry" stickers on them.  Who thought of that crazy idea?

@learymay @MotherGFatherG The problem is that targets inherently drive the system to do other than what is best for the children.
@SpeakOut_Uk @learymay Indeed decisions should be taken on the merits of individual cases rather than to satisfy government targets.
@learymay yes, but there are no targets.
@MotherGFatherG @learymay  there were/are no targets for helping children or families
@learymay @MotherGFatherG I asked the government for a summary.  This was the first system.  You can find traces on net as well.
@learymay @MotherGFatherG It is the local public service agreement targets between local government and central government.

@politicalhackuk @AcocksGreenFG @Jodatu I agree money is tight, it seems odd to spend £30M plus on a new more expensive scheme.
@AcocksGreenFG @politicalhackuk @Jodatu It is also that the council is supposed to be short of money and these cost a lot.

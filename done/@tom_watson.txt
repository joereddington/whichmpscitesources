@Shinsei1967 @liversedge At the moment I can't work out who it benefits. It's one of the intriguing things about it. Sat Apr 04 08:37:15 BST 2015
@AngiePedley Oh I see. Well she should certainly have been called before they ran the story. Sat Apr 04 08:35:42 BST 2015
@nickeardley ...if you're doing that, surely the first point should be the Cabinet Office who by now will have considered their next steps? Sat Apr 04 08:33:39 BST 2015
@nickeardley Well I was rather assuming there would be one, given the seriousness of the leak. I know you have to move a story on but... Sat Apr 04 08:33:07 BST 2015

@bluenose_carl @AngusMacNeilSNP That has crossed my mind. I rather goes against their usual stance. Sat Apr 04 08:18:50 BST 2015
@nickeardley Oh dear, have I called for that? Isn't it normal for them to take place when there has been one? You should ask the Cabinet Sec Sat Apr 04 08:18:15 BST 2015
@AngusMacNeilSNP well if it is, an inquiry would catch them out. Sat Apr 04 08:12:50 BST 2015
@AngusMacNeilSNP they've reproduced a document, right? There's a leak. So there should be an inquiry. Can't have civil servants leaking. Sat Apr 04 08:12:11 BST 2015
@LDNYoungLabour that's wonderful to see. Sat Apr 04 08:10:06 BST 2015
@domhnall_T5 @AngusMacNeilSNP Exactly. Hence the need for an inquiry. Sat Apr 04 08:08:12 BST 2015

@perfecto_cheese I had missed them actually- had an early night. There should definitely be an inquiry.A civil servant lying?That's not on. Sat Apr 04 08:03:09 BST 2015
@AngusMacNeilSNP they told an untruth about me only last week Angus so I know what the Telegraph is like. We need a leak inquiry, right? Sat Apr 04 08:01:40 BST 2015
@Bob__Hudson hahaha. Sat Apr 04 07:59:22 BST 2015
@john_rostron @LeftPeggers @simon_telegraph it's important now. A civil servant accused of lying about the FM? That needs sorting out. Sat Apr 04 07:59:06 BST 2015
@Damian0706 @AJobTracker there should be an inquiry then. Sat Apr 04 07:58:10 BST 2015
@paddybah @Timbleman That's the thing: if it is a lie, there should be an inquiry. We can't have civil servants peddling lies. Sat Apr 04 07:57:50 BST 2015
@perfecto_cheese I'm trying to work out the accuracy of the memo, the motive of the leaker and you're right, why now? Sat Apr 04 07:56:37 BST 2015
@djnicholl @simon_telegraph yes that's true actually. They published a piece about me last week that I had to get them to change. Sat Apr 04 07:55:12 BST 2015
@Shairpie have they? I had an early night! Sat Apr 04 07:54:15 BST 2015
@LeftPeggers @simon_telegraph well that's the thing. I want to know about the document. They wouldn't doctor it would they? Sat Apr 04 07:53:18 BST 2015
@kaithefilmgeek @simon_telegraph I don't 'believe' the Telegraph but the document seems real. Sat Apr 04 07:52:15 BST 2015
@Shairpie No. I wouldn't link at all if it wasn't for the fact the leaked document seems valid. Sat Apr 04 07:51:36 BST 2015
@young_son You're right - I don't trust the Telegraph any more but the internal document seems real. Sat Apr 04 07:50:31 BST 2015

@ncustisTheSun @tomEurosport @BBCr4today Your bio says you are the football writer for the Sun newspaper. I'm smiling at you Neil. Wed Feb 11 08:46:10 GMT 2015
@mandatenow Haha. He's a fine man. I await the pigeon with a message. Wed Feb 11 08:28:47 GMT 2015

@PLDan I'm responding to your retort about cinemas and gigs. Get those workers decent pay Dan. I'm counting on you. Wed Feb 11 08:10:20 GMT 2015
@PLDan Last time I took the kids to Villa Park it was £155 including two scarves but before pop and hot dogs. I'll stick to cineworld! Wed Feb 11 07:48:32 GMT 2015
@williamheath count me in when you do. Wed Feb 11 07:42:59 GMT 2015
@Mrsjackdaniels @afneil I don't know. It's not been followed up. Very happy to go on with Andrew though. Wed Feb 11 07:32:50 GMT 2015
@PLDan It's embarrassing Dan. Ridiculous extremes in pay significantly harm the image of PL. It's easy to sort. Wed Feb 11 07:31:54 GMT 2015
Richard Scudamore nose diving on @BBCR4Today. Defending high ticket prices and minimum wage jobs after a £5 billion telly deal. Hopeless. Wed Feb 11 07:23:05 GMT 2015

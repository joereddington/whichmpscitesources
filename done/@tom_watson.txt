@geoffforcrookes Not so good travelling to Sheffield from Birmingham New Street!
@ivatt2 It's being rebuilt/revamped.
@ballantine70 @DiffRep I actually did. Though I'm now in portcullis house. Parliament's homage to Euston station.
@trialia @mikelcu @ChrispLOL That's true, on both counts.
@wolmarforlondon They're revamping it though. I'm keeping an open mind on the result.
@DiffRep @ballantine70 Blimey. I've not been there for a few years.
@botzarelli @NickCohen4 the weird lighting is spooky though.
@PenzerSimon I've just arrived. Already grumpy.
@mattbuck_hack @twlldun @mePadraigReidy @NickCohen4 that is because you have a comically dark view of humanity.
@NickCohen4 @mePadraigReidy haha. Very revealing.
@PaulGosling1 agree - that ridiculous escalator.
@PenzerSimon well, they keep alternating the platform for the mancs train at short notice there. Hopeless.
@zelo_street they're refurbishing it.
@Snowfaked like marelybone today.
@garysmi Crewe does the best cheese and mushroom toasties in the land. coffee shop between platform one and two.
@NickCohen4 it is but hopefully revamped soon.
@antoniabance they're doing up new street.
@PaulGosling1 new street being re-built. Piccadilly not too bad.
There something immensely depressing about starting out in London from Euston Station. It's the worst major station in the UK.
@IamStan I like Destiny, a lot. I think it's going to be around for some time to come.
@IamStan I've got COD, just have to work this week before I can play it again. SoM looks ace too, though I'm still ploughing on with Destiny
@Manxstar Experience Points. Lol (Laugh Out Loud).
@paulconnew1 I suppose so but it seems a bit of a distraction.
@Manxstar Nothing daft about it. Lots of incentives to buy in the first week. Double XP, for example. For the serious gamer,it's a big deal.
@Manxstar I'm not sure what the gender breakdown on #COD sales is. Plenty of female gamers out there though.

@Gaggy3000 @ian_pace Les - stop being so grumpy.
@NickMillward @AngieEwart that's what I'm saying.
@mosquat power to compel witnesses to attend and oblige organisations to provide documents. That sort of thing.
@oflynnmep ha. You sound like a politician.
@reggaecrisp1 that would make it harder to jail the alleged perpetrators. Sure it would get headlines but not a jury trial.
@MichaelDugherMP @KirkChris @yorkshirelabour @UKLabour well done junior ;-).
@grahamem48 @chrisstacey1 nope.
@Jannnneeeee128 I can only speak as I find. It's complicated but she is not the problem.
There are many people in Westminster who would be happy to see the #CSA inquiry derailed. Theresa May is not one of them. Stay focused team.
@timmalloy70 Tories are street but I believe she her intent is honest.
@timmalloy70 I think she is the only minister who wants to get to the truth.
@SteveDoherty1 they can compel witnesses and require documents to be provided to them.
Now that Woolf has resigned there will have to be a government statement in the House on Monday. There should be a statutory inquiry.
@Bleakworldview @conradlandin the officials should have been across it.

@mildlyserious yes. You're right.
@Magnieboy I think she relies on officials for the due diligence.
@ShyKeenan yes. Without the support of you and others the inquiry will not be able to proceed.
@AxelLandin if only public life was actually that binary.
@AxelLandin I don't know. Advice of her officials?
@DraytonianTay haha. I'm getting soft in middle age.
@PhilipMarshall1 I don't think so.
@Selkie nope. I think she is very honest.
@DrAndrewWatt I've talked to her about it. I think she's a very honest person.
I hope this doesn't descend into a point scoring match against Theresa May. I am certain she still wants to get to the truth.
I sincerely hope a way forward can be found, perhaps that might include the inquiry moving on to a statutory footing.
Without the confidence of survivors, it's very difficult to see how Fiona Wolf can continue in her role.

@Svenvelope @rustyrockets Have you read the book then?
@Svenvelope @rustyrockets No, but I can read what he has to say.
@RobSkilbeck @rustyrockets Not even I'm that cynical Rob!
@philyburkhill Isn't that why we all love it?
@FureyinHD Don't be too worried about that. I think it's mapped out.
@Sarah29Collins @rustyrockets Do you think? He's loaded. I can't imagine the book pays his weekly pocket money.
@SlimPlim @rustyrockets He didn't answer my question on his Guardian web chat earlier in the week. What a swindle. Lol.
@OHCamshaft Good afternoon.
The sneeringly critical review of @rustyrockets book in the Guardian has prompted me to buy it.He's shaking the tree. http://t.co/vvLlthtdPq

@BtSW2014 I did that once. It wasn't a pleasant experience.
@BtSW2014 It's not you,it's the teachers. Drink more water.Read Herman Hesse now. Stay out of the Land Oak pub. Be kinder to Elwood Wilkins.

@gm6016 I was having a lovely morning.
@hoveboy In the morning he always does.
@Conorpope it's funny but not one of them mentioned the spliff.

@tom_watson pleased to have brought you an enjoyable morning master Pope.
@eldaifo Or hire a helicopter to help me escape.
@ColdLazarou this is all getting too deep in metaphors.
@PeteRush thanks Peter. Forgot my new £7 ear phones too. It's that kind of day.
@Harry_Cockburn it's a great comfort to me that my kids detest them.
@captainsooks now you're talkin.
@MrDTJames I know. He's such an everyman.

@PAlanMcMahon don't let that hold you back.
@jonthebeef check you, media city. I was there on Monday creating classical music mayhem.
@a_v_s_p you're not as stupid as you claim.
@LilLFauntleroy faster liddle lord, faster.
@jonthebeef I missed that. I'm missing you and the Crown too.
@a_v_s_p good afternoon.

@KenDay I could do with it this morning.
@nevillefarmer yes. But it was Mick last night.
@geraaht tell me again it's Keith.
@TomMaisey and I always mistake James Dean for Steve McQueen.
@JackCoy4 don't be generous.
@tom_welch68 it is Tom. That hair is amazing.
@johnmcvicker thanks for spotting it.
@AndyPJo1 I went to bed thinking Mick. Woke up with Keith. Scunthorpe is a crazy place.
@hewsim yes. It is. Blimey.
@alanmcbrd so it is. Well done for being first to spot that.
@Harry_Cockburn Harry, it is. How did I do that.
@IanKerr blimey. It was Mick last night. It's like magic.
@ARUCleary aargh. Need my reading glasses.
@juliecullen haha. Sorry - even though I made Chris Hawkins today, it's still a bit early.

@neilmclaughlin2 Couldn't quite add the mint sauce. Call me squeamish.
@bevclack @OxLabourCllrs I was once described as "the most charming whip I have ever had". The MP was a top five rebel. Lol.

Great night with the Labour battalions in Scunthorpe.  No-one got the @drenge question in the music quizz though. http://t.co/Tm0OHqix3s
@steiny What a pity you didn't think about the failure of markets before you endorsed the Tories at their conference.
Heading up the tracks to see my whip Mr @NikDakinMP at the fundraising dinner of Scunthorpe Labour party. Pie, peas and a few pints on him.
@greenknight100 How have you drawn that conclusion?
@greenknight100 It has been made perfectly clear to me that it doesn't matter what I think - by both survivors and the Home Office.
@vincegraff @nytamann @georgeeaton Do you have to have this conversation in front of me on twitter? Lol.

@singleaspect Please listen to Nina Simone's 1966 album, wild is the wind or any album by Led Zeppelin.
@Aleatorus You don't think @BBC6Music plays "good quality music"?
@faceofboe I'm only joshing.
@singleaspect You want to leave me with the sieve and six music, right?
@Aleatorus I do listen to it, on my digital radio.
@lindasgrant @BBC6Music @BBCRadio3 @PetrocTrelawny He's beaten me on the name alone.
@TalcolmMucker @LouiseMensch Only when not used ironically. Like ROFL. http://t.co/K9IIzqi0it
@lindasgrant @BBC6Music @BBCRadio3 It's the genteel nature of Radio 3 listeners that is so redeeming. Lol.
@79cer I wouldn't lose sleep over it but that's a very personal view. My kids would go ape.
@DJDarren You're ahead of the curve Senor.
@michaelgoodier7 @BBC6Music @BBCRadio3 There are so few of them we could give them free radios and train them how to press the buttons.
@tommyrpearson @BBCRadio3 Have I upset you?

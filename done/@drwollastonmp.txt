@drwollastonmp
Welcome to 'new' politics, UKIP style. What's today's flip flop; insurance for healthcare, forced deportations?  http://t.co/dHqxxJr6jg
So Reckless happy to pretend he believed in deporting EU migrants when he thought it was UKIP policy...no wait...  http://t.co/dHqxxJr6jg
Grt to be with volunteers, trustees & supporters of @DevonRapeCrisis today. Thankyou for 3 years making a difference http://t.co/JSddeJQGc6
@beeflin it's hot air, Labour were 'privatising' for the last decade incl TCS which led to Virgin running Devon children's services
@pigreen they have a way of promising everything but with absolutely no way of funding it I'm afraid
@dartangler which is why I arranged for the minister to visit your boat so that you could help to make the case & why I back a referendum
@terryllloyd there is room for anyone who is prepared to stand for election but real dangers in populist scapegoating of foreigners
Tories have lessons to learn from the #RochesterandStrood campaign, but that must not include a lurch to right or a vile scapegoating agenda
Reckless wins, can the media use him instead of saturation Farage so people can see this fake 'new politics' for what it really is
.@CommonsHealth is calling for evidence on diet, exercise & health. Details re inquiry & 'what works' approach here http://t.co/h7zNlBxWzI
Why shd an accident of geography result in such a disparate budget per head across devolved nations for health unrelated to need? #barnett
Farage confused about whether to replace free NHS with insurance model & Reckless confused about repatriation. Send #UKIP packing instead
@Chelsea1960s @adamboultonSKY @MarkReckless but not confused, incompetent or racist
.@MarkReckless calls for repatriation of EU workers after a transition period. Farage calls that a 'minor cause of confusion'. It's hateful
.@MarkReckless shows his true colours on repatriation, is that really what #RochesterandStrood want?
@drtomround their title, not mine!
@dr_wood_wca plenty of lists of voting record, outside earnings, & of course elections!
@qofdatabase agree #CQC map should be more clearly labelled about its purpose & shortcomings; not a tool to judge overall practice quality
@DrSdeG where CQC inspection is available that it clearly visible as appears as a white pin marker with link to report instead of the 1-6
If #CQC had not published, could be accused of not putting patients first by taking opportunity to drive change prior to inspections
.@DrSdeG it's a dilemma, publicatn will drive early change in those markers but may also have unintended consequences which need appraising
Overall the #CQC tool should be more clearly labelled as a poor way to judge overall quality of a practice, but still right to publish
Publication of the #CQC tool may drive early change but handle with care as if other markers had been chosen cld look very different 1/2
The #CQC map is merely a tool to prioritise inspections, but it will undoubtedly rapidly change practice in those in band 1

@JuliaHCox we hold an annual accountability hearing, not due til New Year so there is time for people to send suggested qns & evidence
@grahamsphillips look forward to hearing from @nhsconfed & have long supported extended role for pharmacy alongside primary care
@StephenRainbird thanks Stephen
Tues @CommonsHealth hears from Kate Barker, LGA & ADASS. Link to great summary of Barker Commission http://t.co/ZqfZsLEkKT @TheKingsFund
@alicejames22 evicted! Bit of a shocker to have to cycle up hill myself
Thank you to @DevonSeniorVoic for inviting me to your AGM & for all your local & national campaigning http://t.co/u5eo9vIRHD
So beautiful at Holne Bridge today I had to stop to take this photo but it doesn't do it justice @sportsmankayaker http://t.co/6E0nRCW8XX
Just come from an open meeting at Holne; we ran out of chairs. no lack of interest in politics #wato @BBCWorldatOne
Today I'm at #Holne Village Hall for an open meeting 10am, everyone welcome & later speaking at @DevonSeniorVoic Isca Centre Exeter 2pm
Great to be with so many local businesses @BrixhamChamber tonight discussing local economic successes & challenges http://t.co/JMeJFeHUDc
@sleathcorps @ceesav @Melonhead999 great choice, enjoy!
The issue with the #CancerDrugsFund @BBCr4today is that it excludes other equally unpleasant conditions & undermines whole point of NICE
@Neil_GPmag @GPonlinenews pls could you DM your contact details
@GPonlinenews that links to a very old interview from 2009, where is the link to the current interview?
Thanks to S Hams District council & EA for coming to London to discuss future protection of vital #Slapton Line & Shoreline Managmt Plan
Sleep well tonight knowing you've supported something extraordinary @senseaboutsci #AllTrials http://t.co/KWkXZyX589
Link to #Wanless & Whittam report, good to hear home sec confirm acceptance of all recommendations.  https://t.co/EXl1G03RTp
At 2.30 today @CommonsHealth hears from the Kings Fund, Health Foundation & Nuffield Trust @jappleby123 @nedwards_1 l##
To clarify; I voted against undermining Parliament but for the #EAW (even though of course that wasn't actually on the order paper) #jeez
For undermining Parliament & the Home Secretary tonight the #owngoal award goes to the 'usual channels'
Home Sec set out a compelling case for #EAW ; shame not to allow Parliament a proper vote on it
This is a sorry example for the start of #parliamentweek http://t.co/hByhkEdovC #EAW
Wholly unsatisfactory that vote tonight excludes #EAW but Commons being expected to treat it as a 'proxy'. Speaker clarifies no such thing
@TheProjectYP agree, as set out in @CommonsHealth report http://t.co/ji8pdp3EAg
@elizabethdwiar @Amanda_Vickery thanks
I support #EAW but Parliament must have opportunity to debate & vote following genuine concerns raised.
It would be an abuse of process not to allow a vote on European Arrest Warrant. This must be clarified immediately #EAW
@simplem_ths to be fair I've done quite a bit of that on what needs to change
Easy for some to be judgemental about bariatric surgery but we wouldn't deny cost effective surgery for drinkers, smokers, skiing injuries
Better to prevent morbid obesity in the first place, but we don't take judgemental approach to other treatments  http://t.co/d16ot13g6K
@hsmall even as someone who is not personally religious, I disagree with you & find the service deeply moving
Honoured to join #Brixham in remembering the courage & service of our armed forces past & present http://t.co/jDTgC2BRW3
.@jlpatient77 agree, prevention & early help was the key recommendation of @CommonsHealth #CAMHS inquiry http://t.co/Z5Eb0sWd86
@Ermintrude2 @CCLeicsPolice @PoliceChiefs @CareQualityComm but a single visit would demonstrate why NHS must provide safe alternative
@Ermintrude2 @CCLeicsPolice @PoliceChiefs @CareQualityComm agree but takes longer than making it a never event, CQC cld also visit & ban use
.@CCLeicsPolice may I suggest @PoliceChiefs formally invite Prof Mike Richards & Dr Paul Lelliott to visit cells at night @CareQualityComm
@CCLeicsPolice @PoliceChiefs the NHS shld make it a 'never event' & have their own facilities, not dump children in cells @CareQualityComm
.@CCLeicsPolice @PoliceChiefs end perverse financial incentive for NHS to continue use of cells. I've asked the Home Sec to send the bill
Stop criminalising & terrifying children in mental health crisis; my observer piece http://t.co/VV9agqx1YB
@markcross do you mean the reported case in Florida? If so I wouldn't agree with you that it merits top story in UK
.@Puffles2010 what would you do if you knew in your heart of hearts that your Party would be more likely to win if you stepped down?
It's painful to watch the sharks circling Ed; all just waiting for someone else to take the first bite.
.@LeeDHudson I'm amazed Ed doesn't ask himself if he really wants to go down as the man who lost the Labour the election. He's a good man
@Another_OfMany ha
@Eddie_Raunds @McPartlandJohn @UKLabour ah but both true!
@peteo48 quite
.@McPartlandJohn why wouldn't Ed go, he must know that @UKLabour stand a far far better chance with someone else at the helm? A tough choice
It's the Game of Thrones question; I still think Ed will fall on his sword rather than be axed by one of his 'friends'
Tomorrow I'll be at @DartmouthAcad then Totnes CAB before an open meeting at Foxhole Community Centre 2pm. Everyone welcome
@ThinkEmily my question was whether press are paid for this 'free' saturation advertising?
@phuntphunt93 I did but some were late to the decision which happened some time ago & have pretended it was recent
@Geoada2011 :)
It's not that it's a bad one, but if it's an advert, call it an advert #notnews
@Geoada2011 the problem is hidden advertising. Also widely used by big pharma in magazine articles. If it's an advert, call it an advert
@PARITYFORMH thank you
How much are all these national papers being paid for marketing the JL Christmas ad but masquerading it as news? #notnews
Please submit your views to our @CommonsHealth inquiry into #EndofLifeCare Call for evidence link here http://t.co/yejewdreD3
@lydiaburfield thanks Lydia
@liamstark22 see previous tweets
@sullivandeej in practice not in public interest to prosecute in those cases & rarely happens. Thanks for FB, will review next year
@sullivandeej of course, we disagree about supporting drug cartels or the time to evaluate evidence but it doesn't make either of us wrong!
@sullivandeej thanks Deej, as stated I will be watching the emerging evidence from the U.S. re harm reduction. Too soon to evaluate yet
@Childrensfood it was a don't drink your calories approach!
Good to meet with Sam & Brian from @ndcs_uk to discuss children's audiology http://t.co/iJBwCbpkMk http://t.co/LTPDfNSvlP
@ShaunLintern 236 children last yr, needs earlier intervention, make it a 'never event' & remove perverse financial incentive to use cells
Looking forward to discussing  Children & Adolescent's #mentalhealth 8.20 on @BBCDevon #CAMHS link here http://t.co/ji8pdp3EAg
Link to @CommonsHealth inquiry into Children & Adolescent's Mental Health #CAMHS published today http://t.co/ji8pdp3EAg
Today at 2.30 @CommonsHealth hears from Norman Lamb on Integrated Care Pioneers. How can we make it happen at scale & pay for start up costs
Looking forward to publication of @CommonsHealth #CAMHS inquiry tomorrow. Press briefing today 1.15  #mentalhealth for children & Young ppl
.@Sirhornet @david_colquhoun I would want to be able to prosecute anyone selling fake Ebola cures & putting lives at risk
@GabrielScally it might be funny if it wasn't such dangerous garbage
.@GabrielScally agreed! I'd  put people peddling Ebola homeopathy on a par with selling fake bomb detectors https://t.co/5T8I5kfjDO
Great to be in @DartingtonHall today chairing event on psychological therapies & listening to concerns on evidence base for CBT. Any views?
.@VictoryV2013 @UKIP UKIP can't deliver on immigration, referendum, economy or anything else for that matter. #AllTalkNastyTrousers
.@tracey_crouch @KellyTolhurst now there's something really positive for #RochesterandStrood Much better than Nigel's moany farts club band
@KeeleyMP @LabourEoin @Debbie_abrahams @guardian my mother waited so long for cancer surgery under labour she used savings to pay for it
.@KeeleyMP @guardian that is not the same as you well know & also happened often under Labour, as I witnessed as a former GP.
@alextalbot116 @Debbie_abrahams @KeeleyMP @guardian so can you name a single new charge or top up? Please do let me know
.@Debbie_abrahams @KeeleyMP @guardian please could Labour actually identify any examples of new charges or top ups? They would be illegal
Xenophobia & scapegoating are powerful & dangerous weapons. UKIP can deliver nothing but divisive & miserable empty promises. Vote positive!
@CrustyDinosaur @glasterlaw1 so speaks the negative voice of UKIP. Britain is better than this!
.@bmainian @glasterlaw1 some of those UKIP voices are pretty ugly. Careful what you wish for
The Farage mirage: the closer you get, the uglier their message &  negative vision of Britain. This is a great country; stay positive!
@_tommylong it's relevant but not sufficient
#parkhomes debate challenging iniquitous commission charges levied on park home owners on sales, a review is long overdue
@sullivandeej we don't yet know balance of harm or harm reduction but I can assure you I will follow evidence as it emerges from US
@TeenagePie @sullivandeej as you may know, I support an evidence based harm reduction approach on alcohol too
@NormanBakerMP agrees too early to draw conclusions from legalisations in States. But of course we can learn from others
@georgeeaton @DPJHodges at least SNP have decency not to vote on issues which do not affect their constituents
@sullivandeej the figures from ONS for cannabis use by 16-24 year old show it is at lowest since 1996. Harm reduction is key for policy
@sullivandeej @5742Days no, you misquote me! I said we should look at evidence as it emerges on impact of changes in US re harm incr or decr
@FixersUK excellent! Great success
.@TerryBarnes72 which is why I will be watching evidence from US to see if legalisation reduces harm to teenagers or increases use & harms
@RevPaulCA no, I'm saying look at evidence as it emerges from US on whether leads to harm reduction. But stress cannabis not harmless
@RevPaulCA @CarolineLucas of course but no doubt that cannabis is a gateway drug to tobacco (which kills half its long term users early)
Drug debate should focus on harm reduction & look closely at evidence as it emerges from Washington & Colorado. Too early to judge as yet
@jfernandezochoa @BeckleyDrugs @TransformDrugs @Release_drugs @Drug_Science my point was that #cannabis is harmful especially for teens
@sullivandeej just thought you'd like to know that I will now attend the debate on drugs policy
@sullivandeej yes & it just isn't yet sufficient but I'm happy to review once further evidence from States. Good night
@sullivandeej as former GP I've met too many young people seriously harmed by cannabis. Not voting until confident that won't increase.
@sullivandeej drug use is falling & I won't vote for legalisation until demonstrates reduced risks of psychosis in children. We disagree
@Just_Clive @ResilientGP thanks Clive
@sullivandeej no
@sullivandeej too early to judge effects of changes to legalise in some US States so I won't be backing changes to legislation at this stage
@colinwforster @mgtmccartney @CPSThinkTank false logic
@Jesse_Norman @CPSThinkTank my point is that an annual statement of personal cost to NHS on doormat cld have serious unintended consequences
@CPSThinkTank there are better ways to identify inappropriate users & to help them IMO
@CPSThinkTank @Jesse_Norman but with dangerous consequences for people e.g. with severe depression or victims of domestic violence.
@make_trouble @CPSThinkTank straightforward to include drug price on scripts which could be left off by prescriber where appropriate
I do wonder whether anyone at @CPSThinkTank met/discussed with anyone suffering severe depression, cancer, transplant, domestic violence..
.@illbedsidemanRz @CPSThinkTank quite, I shudder to think how it would feel for someone already feeling worthless to receive one of these
Who would collect & collate this raft of new data? Also serious harms possible & confidentiality issues @CPSThinkTank http://t.co/R6pOoMG9nZ
Ghastly! Heavy users of the NHS made to feel guilty; most would dearly love not to have to be there @CPSThinkTank http://t.co/R6pOoMG9nZ
Retaining shares doesn't mean civil service CEO is 'working for free', still a dangerous conflict of interest http://t.co/30ee9EJHms
@theresecoffey but not in the hands of the people we work for only in the hands of a committee of colleagues
Great to meet up with the Scouts today; thanks for all your questions & suggestions http://t.co/unWpjauLis
A disappointing night for parliamentary reform as Commons votes no to #RealRecall
On a happier note, thank you to all the town clerks who came to Parliament today to share the challenges of this role http://t.co/9lrb8PCIRs
The power to recall MPs won't rest with voters but with a closed committee of other MPs. What changed? Nothing
I am always bowled over by the compassion & care from @OnlyDads supporting fathers but putting children at the heart of all you do
Terrific panel of speakers & expertise at @FamLawPanel debate led by @OnlyDads this evening in Parliament #families
@PaddyBriggs @NHSEngland difference is that ours comes almost wholly from taxation; majority don't want to change from that path
The consequences of failure on prevention & funding gap & what decisions, in what order, would have to be taken must be clearly articulated
I'm particularly interested to hear what is @NHSEngland 's Plan B if future govt doesn't step up to the plate on prevention & funding gap
I will be backing #realrecall today. Congratulations to @ZacGoldsmith on his tenacious & worthwhile campaign
Tuesday 2.30 @CommonsHealth questions Simon Stevens @NHSEngland CEO, chief of finance & medical director #5YFV & health spending. Any qns?
The more you look at this graph the less it makes any sense. Hell no! http://t.co/kQxrmrCpbm
It's been a busy day, open meeting in Townstal, visit to thank volunteers at Dartmouth food bank, NHS IT at the surgery & @DartFoodFest

This summer Simon Stevens came to #Dartmouth to meet voluntary NHS partners & their key ask; longer term funding & make it easier to access
On p15 of #FYFV great news for NHS voluntary partners. Grants rather than burdensome contracting & move to multiyear commitments
Public health ambitions for #5YFV will need support at govt level too on tackling obesity & problem drinking
Good to see strong focus on public health & prevention #5YFV
Link to the NHS #5YFV well worth a read http://t.co/cbTFGFeUhm
@masters_nik disagree, govt actively trying to change this
@mulberrybush good to hear 50 more paediatric beds will be funded but looking forward to CAMHS inquiry report soon
@tomwilson23 no one blames police for this, hope that street triage & crisis concordat measures make a difference
It should be classed as a 'never event' for a person with a #mentalhealth crisis to be detained in a police cell rather than health facility
@KarlTurnerMP @BBCNewsnight Karl I'm sick of the dogma, we need calm discussion of facts
@tomwilson23 clearly a disgrace for anyone in such distress to be in a cell, sorry to hear it
@KarlTurnerMP @BBCNewsnight it was wrong for labour to misrepresent a non party political discussion of issues facing NHS
The issue of S136 detentions of people with #mentalhealth crisis in cells is one which should shock us irrespective of age & ethnicity
The 3 areas I spoke about re NHS funding gap, greater focus on prevention, funding for double running for reconfiguration, a bigger cheque
Labour are misrepresenting my @BBCNewsnight IV. There are no plans for extension of charging or tops ups in the NHS & nor will there be
The @CommonsHealth takes evidence on Ebola at 2.30 today from ChiefMedOfficer, PHEngland & chief scientific officer DFiD
Thank you to amazing audience on @BBCFreeSpeech sharing experiences of #mentalhealth issues & recovery Thanks too for all the feedback

Putting together #EbolaQuestionsUK for Wednesday's @CommonsHealth hearing. Thanks for all those sent so far
@kevin2kane thanks for all your helpful suggested questions Kevin
@pigreen their role however vital in recognising cases and early implementation of safe practice to prevent further spread
Serious concerns remain about #SaatchiBill including no evidence it's litigation which deters so why the hype from http://t.co/DwMjPg8ekq
One danger of the #SaatchiBill is the risk of undermining clinical trials. The wealthy will sidestep them but also risk being exploited
Where are the provisions in the #SaatchiBill to ensure results of innovative treatments are collated? Isolated anecdotes aren't  evidence
@PeterWeaving now following you, so should work now
Could @macmillancancer confirm the total amount you will be contributing to Staffs prime provider pilot please @dwilliamsHSJ @ShaunLintern
@ShaunLintern more than a touch of the emperor's new clothes but even more expensive
@ShaunLintern I think what shocked too was that the process is being funded by all those donations to Macmillan. Did anyone ask the donors?
FAQs for @ZacGoldsmith real recall amendments http://t.co/sOQ2yncdCJ which I will be supporting
@ShaunLintern seemed to me 'prime provider' a misnomer, more like expensive way of commissioning a 'prime commissioner' cum self-provider
Keen to hear from front line health staff too, your qns for PHE & CMO for #EbolaQuestionsUK hearing Wed How prepared is your hospital/A&E/GP
Pls follow the links if you would like to join @OnlyDads parenting & divorce debate hosted in Parliament this Monday http://t.co/Ge4w11devs
.@agtomlinson if the Pakistan govt is happy to overlook the judicial murder of women then I don't want to send them a penny, only to NGOs

@jameschappers @NickBolesMP @mikefreermp infantilises MPs & distorts democratic process IMO as well as perpetuating out dated patronage.
Discussing what makes a real #openprimary with @BBCRADIOKENT  after 8.30 Giving Rochester & Strood the say over local Conservative candidate
@NickBolesMP @mikefreermp what's even more absurd is that he had to do so, as PPSs are not members of the govt so why this restriction?
@Ryan__Blake I think it is a very significant shift & in line with public opinion. The time has come for the UK to recognise Palestine
Glad to be one of 274 MPs voting to call on the govt to "recognise the state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel". Just 12 opposed
@lorriman01 how kind :)
@MartinHeneghan thank you Martin
@anngodden centre right compassionate conservatism is the way ahead! But thank you :)
@Ferretneck that is the current modelling but the priority must be to stop spread of Ebola in West Africa or that will be far higher
@JamesTwigger thanks James
Big alcohol extends its lethal grip http://t.co/eoRHLiaWdR
.@Teigngardener I'm in favour of Palestinian Statehood as well as the State of Israel, worth following the debate
Worth listening in to the Commons debate on Israel & Palestine
@hughvirginia see my previous tweets
@J9MES thanks, happy to hear we're about to hold another in Rochester & Strood
@Gurudoc indeed, so any questions?
John Manzoni starts his new role as head of the civil service. RT to ask him to stop working for big alcohol at the same time
Tues at 2.30 @CommonsHealth Ctee will be hearing evidence on the controversial procurement of cancer & end of life care in Staffs. AnyQns?
@Independent AKA fly tipping
@RoyLilley @dochawking @clarercgp how do you think the quality of note keeping, surely essential to patient safety, should be assessed?
@ethicsconsult Gini used internationally but not by Labour as rather inconvenient
@dochawking @RoyLilley actual examples please of how it is being carried out
@ethicsconsult not being ignored at all & worth checking out Gini coefficient on inequality; it widened under labour & narrowed since 2010
@RoyLilley please email me at the Health Committee with your concerns about how this is being carried out in practice Roy
@nickbilbrough almost certainly supporting but will listen to the debate & views of constituents
@jenniebond1 perhaps one of family could email me Jennie?
@TimMontgomerie unhappy dysfunctional workplaces make for unhappy & dysfunctional legislators. We would all benefit from reform
@Budhistrider then you cannot have read it
Painfully honest & moving piece from Brooks Newmark at the end of this, I hope he & his family are now left in peace http://t.co/1z8YF2Cn1P
Surely Labour MPs will now vote to support the referendum in 2017. To block Friday's Referendum bill wld be indefensible & hand seat to UKIP
@cllrkevinball thanks Kevin
@Gurudoc as I pointed out, important not to dress up racism as 'just speaking my mind'

@BrunoAdventurou @Independent far better for EU to focus on dodgy corporate tax avoidance than regulating power of vacuum cleaners
@craigawoodhouse @LOS_Fisher @laurapitel if true then members should be spitting feathers
@TripadvisorFake will do
I first wrote about patronage in 2011 but the longer I have observed its effect, the more it disgusts me. http://t.co/mhBFEQTUTS
.@JackieDP  trouble is though that too often those ideas get dictated by SPAds & election gurus not democratically elected MPs & members
@jameschappers not me! & as they say, the best cure for sentimentality about HoL is to watch it in action
Patronage is at the heart of the disempowerment of voters & reinforces 'cosy cartels'. It is out of place in a modern democracy
I'd never been to a political meeting before applying to be an MP; what's shocked me most at Westminster is the malign effect of patronage
@theresecoffey my point is that they were open caucuses not open primaries & they don't sufficiently  widen the 'selectorate'
@Bucksrockers let's hope @DouglasCarswell is able to tackle the homophobic fringe too when talking about tolerance. Majority support SSM
@theresecoffey but what was the turnout? Could also pilot open primaries coinciding with council elections & e-open primaries to reduce cost
"Vote for us to keep out the other guy" line is not enough, nor abuse, all Parties should start wider challenge of political reform
.@theresecoffey genuine open primaries could be made far cheaper & open to all but I suspect there are other reasons parties dislike them!
@ourmanontheM62 rejected resoundingly by the British people in a referendum. Alt, like list systems make it even harder to hold to account
Glad to see Rochester & Strood to be offered genuine all postal open primary. It's a start; gives real say over candidate
Time for all parties to wake up & shake up their rigid systems of patronage which stifle democratic debate & lead to those cosy cartels
Powerful speech from @DouglasCarswell sends message to UKIP on tolerance & to others "cosy cartel politics is not meaningful democracy"
Rather than dogma, we need to see the evidence on funding gap & range of options to fill it #bbcqt & consequences of doing nothing
#bbcqt @CommonsHealth will be answering this question on NHS funding in our autumn inquiry, public deserve answers http://t.co/gP5cItDtnJ
I will be at South Brent Village Hall today for an open meeting at 1pm, everyone welcome. Also catching up with CCG at Leatside & KEVICC
Thanks to everyone who came to public meetings today in #Kingsbridge & #Stokenham topics raised incl housing, transport, immigration, health
Well worth a read; background to today's coalition announcements on #mentalhealth & achieving parity of esteem https://t.co/UjfYkOXWNd
Interested to hear from health professionals how well informed they feel about local emergency referral pathways for suspected Ebola cases
Unimaginable misery for #Ebola victims as local health systems overwhelmed. UKaid to help W Africa  is in all our interests & readiness here
@ChefHermes thank you

@SomeblokeJust shame you feel that way, it's simply not true. It matters because all the ranty abuse just puts  people off applying
@andrewjlockley it's why we need a truly free press; how else do we expose corruption? Levels of corruption low in UK in pt thanks to them
@AlexanderHDH how kind
@Dr_star_T terrible!
@IainDale :)
@make_trouble sadly, conflict closer still.
@Cb260Ac quite, Gladstone had quite a lot in common with Berlusconi
@ACQuinney I think that has long been an issue tbh. Still an imbalance & dominance of career political elites in all parties
@AlexanderHDH do you mean this one? http://t.co/ZYIht8Dz9V
@Dr_star_T wow!
@KateHamblin thanks
@devonviews we need to address demographic democratic balance & provided schools not divisively politicised I would support
@RSCPlymouth its a great campaign, good luck!
.@andrewjlockley in all my time in medicine & in politics I've never once been offered a bribe, in what other country would that be true?
@PaulbernalUK @Maggotlaw :)
@TOTNEZ the blog has misrepresented the argument I was trying to make about why this requires international agreements
@TOTNEZ my point was that UK companies also trading abroad. I have long stopped shopping at Amazon as prefer companies paying UK corp tax
@TOTNEZ my view is that companies should pay corporation tax on money earned in UK, we need international agreements as this is a 2 way strt
@JustinWalkerBCG your link doesn't give any information on which to form an opinion
Has there ever been a golden age when people really felt that Westminster was in touch & fully represented their views? If so, when?
.@JustinWalkerBCG it was a serious question & judging by conversations I have with Kippers, for new joiners, little to do with EU
@terryllloyd you & me both
Good morning Kippers, so who & what do you really want for breakfast? #UKIP
Many papers linking to vile terrorist propaganda; it is what they want! They don't share links to rape so why do so for sadistic murders?
Remember #AlanHenning as all that is best in humanity, not as his vile murderers demand. Rest in Peace
Insightful piece @HarrietMaltby sadly little insight re dysfunctional culture from those who should act to change it http://t.co/U6zxYtz35U
@sarajanebaker great to meet you too!
Loved my Loddiswell visits today to school, church & open meeting; NHS, #EndOfLife care, EVEL & roads all hot topics http://t.co/bxn45ori2R
Today I'll be in #Loddiswell visiting the school, St Michael's to meet volunteers at 10am & open meeting 11am village hall; everyone welcome
Thank you for all the responses, @CommonsHealth wants to know what we should include in our call for evidence for End of Life Care inquiry
The @CommonsHealth Ctee will be holding an inquiry into end of life care. What would you like to see included in our call for evidence?
@Vin_Diwakar @CommonsHealth absolutely! This must include all conditions needing end of life care, not restricted to cancer
@Vin_Diwakar @NVTweeting @CommonsHealth have already met with & asked @TeenageCancer to send their views, please suggest others
@DrDarrenConway @WelshGasDoc @CommonsHealth what aspects of Saatchi Bill do you feel are relevant within call for evidence?
@VictoryV2013 insight into that of course but can't help thinking that as assisted suicide illegal would detract from purpose of inquiry
@VictoryV2013 feeling in control at EOL does matter but assisted suicide is a different issue & could risk distorting the inquiry IMO
@NVTweeting @CommonsHealth I hope you will send me your full list of ideas on what should be included in the call for evidence
.@WelshGasDoc worth remembering what #EndOfLifeCare could be like for patients and families before the LCP. I'm looking for evidence
.@StuSutton @CommonsHealth @drmarkporter what's the emerging evidence about the experience and quality of end of life care since LCP ended?
The @CommonsHealth Ctee will be holding an inquiry into end of life care. What would you like to see included in our call for evidence?
@Sarcobash @DartingtonHall @danceindevon so enjoyed meeting you & all the dancers too http://t.co/b13FkzNQgy
@PickardJE I sincerely hope so!
Thanks to all those who turned out for a buoyant #CPC14 great to meet you. TY for helping to lead & shape the political debate

GPs won't like their choices; with Labour family doctors get wiped out by nationalisation or with Conservatives 7 day access.
@Barnabyspeak yes
speaking at @TeenageCancer 8.00 Hyatt, LGA event, media suite 12.30. Marie Curie 5.30 ICC & RCGP 7.30 ICC all welcome #CPC14
@Teigngardener thanks
@davidcox65 @CTC_Cyclists @allpartycycling sorry to be miss you, I'm already booked to speak at Teenage Cancer Trust Event.
Looking forward to speaking at @TeenageCancer Trust 8am Hyatt #CPC14 with @MichaelLCrick & Jane Sutton
He is Reckless with the facts too @IsabelHardman
ISIS has declared war on humanity, especially women & threatens us all. My @guardian piece on the Commons vote http://t.co/DuqCpCAcWv
In many ways these defections are an opportunity to reset & reassert the Conservative Party at the centre right
@DavidLockQC no it isn't
Should clarify ... I'm staying put & fighting for the centre right to be at the heart of the Conservative Party, not a UKIP panic attack
@BenMearns :)
The Conservative Party won't gain extra support by shifting right but millions of centre right voters would move elsewhere, myself included
.@frankiecrisp1 if the fringe Right want to shuffle off the cliff, we shouldn't leap after them.
Mark Reckless' defection is no great surprise & no great loss #NothingToSeeHere
@jenniebond1 please could you email me with your preferred contact details Thanks
@ReachEd please email my office with your preferred email contact asking to be included. Thanks
@jenniebond1 as set out here http://t.co/tPp0zs2jg4 please email if you would like to be included in future mail outs; majority supported
@ReachEd I voted in favour. There's a letter on my website sent to my email list so pls let me know if you'd like to be included in future
Commons at its best debating whether or not to join in military action against IS, Cameron right to seek the consent of Parliament
@markcross @DevonCC @totnes (!) Was told new signs would be going up to give clear direction to car parks & popandshop, any sign of them?
@carolinejmolloy @NHSour anyone can submit evidence & @CommonsHealth is a cross party committee, see link on website
Looking forward to the launch of the electronic #TotnesPound; making it even easier to help our local economy http://t.co/sGAwepQhfL
@lgbtransaction offered to meet/correspond with constituents from your group as per parliamentary protocol so pls ask them to contact me
@lgbtransaction @adriansandersmp please contact my office
@ed_schwab 'red line' on use of Chem Weapons was crossed by Saddam when he used gas against Iran. Weaponised white phosphorus IMO also a CW
Discussing why I support military action against ISIS but voted against last year @bbc5live letter to constituents http://t.co/tPp0zs2jg4
@MFrancoisCerrah @mehdirhasan another extraordinary & brave woman murdered by ISIS barbarians for defending human rights.

@mikeallenshouse So much for his pledge to accept the democratic will of Scottish people; sour grapes esp as timetable for legisln set out
A good summary from @PaulGoodmanCH of some of the options in response to the English Question. http://t.co/4UOTZQpY7Q
Struggling to find any answers? Just ask a different question. @MichaelPDeacon nails down the jelly http://t.co/uBFWygvsTC
Great to see @DartingtonLW about to feature on @BBCcountryfile an incredible project & fabulous #Dartmoor on too
@BrianHaroldRead but it won't halt  ISIS genocide, mass rape & enslavement, that demands decisive international response not kind wishes
.@PutneyDebates it is vital to have a formula that reflects need wherever someone lives, the Barnett formula doesn't & is indefensible
@denspw @paulwaugh profound constitutional changes demand great care & a national debate. Any legislation will be in draft form only by GE
@CJHamps @paulwaugh I didn't & neither did Parliament. We need a formula fair to all, wherever they live in a truly United Kingdom
A truly United Kingdom must be fair to England too; my blog on English votes & #Barnett http://t.co/AJk7CU7UPO
.@paulwaugh so Ed would leech even more out of rural areas in England; already hit by #barnett & struggling with demands of age & sparsity
Excellent from @Telegraph on the leadership needed for our National conversation on the Union http://t.co/jI2Ofn2dto
@adriansandersmp I don't want decisions which cld be devolved made in Westminster; even less keen that English only laws decided by Scotland
@adriansandersmp @GardeningGolfer not clear from your blog if you feel Scottish MPS should continue to vote on laws which don't affect Scots
.@Ed_Miliband wants to continue to wheel in his Scottish MPs to outvote the English on laws which don't apply in Scotland. That's 2tier FGS
.@mauriceg88 regional assemblies v expensive; money better spent on people. I hear no clamour for more politicians or layers of government
@tinydaff money that wld be spent on regional assemblies would be better spent on people ( esp with a fairer formula)
@denspw the situation already exists in Scotland without doing so on laws affecting Scotland
@gimpyblog if you read the piece you will see I specifically refer to the need for a formula which reflects health inequality & deprivation
A truly United Kingdom must be fair to England too; my blog on English votes & Barnett http://t.co/AJk7CU7UPO
How on earth can Labour insist that Scottish MPs continue to vote on legislation which does not affect their constituents?
A network of city states with devolved powers would do nothing for rural England. Unitary Counties & an English Parliament better
English votes for English laws! announced by PM. It's a good start & I will be doing everything I can to help make it happen.
Scotland has shown the way but the more we fragment English legislatures the more we would add costs better spent on people not structures
Westminster will need to change; this result cannot mean business as usual. An English Parliament within a federal UK
Federal UK the fairest way forward now significant powers are to be devolved to Scotland but not with fragmented & expensive regional states
We need an English chamber in Parliament deciding on laws that only affect England. Regional government wastes money better spent on people
This result was a win for both sides of #indyref  renegotiations happen & more effectively when there is a serious chance you will leave
We are a United Kingdom! Thank you Scotland x
Whatever the result, #indyref has been a triumph for democracy. Leaders must respect the result in both deeds & words but be fair to all UK
More than I can say, I hope Scotland has decided to stay. That decision was theirs alone but from now on, we must all be consulted #indyref
Thanks to everyone for lively discussions on the English question, our constitution, ISIS & local issues at my #Dartmouth open meeting today
Robbie Burns: “Be Britain still to Britain true, Amang ourselves united.” I hope so @TelePolitics: http://t.co/8i8OA4fjlN
@davidcox65 @sustrans @CTC_Cyclists great to hear you are in South Devon :)
We have so much to be proud of together; don't rip us apart! Scotland, England, Wales, N Ireland #BetterTogether
@qprdave1234 look at the figures shame the left don't recognise the value of rising full time skilled jobs or welcome these figures.
.@bradleyc27 1.33 million more of these jobs are full time & 2/3 are in higher skilled roles! & good news on women's employment too
54% fall in unemployment (JSA) since 2010 in Totnes constituency & good news nationally too as unemployment finally falls below 1m
@LiverpoolPeteG @TimMontgomerie thanks, I agree you should include the centre right
Looking forward to my open meeting 12.00 today at St John's  Bridgetown, everyone welcome & also to speaking at #Totnes Probus
@Scoscarwood sad to hear it; I remember many many similar cases over 24 yrs in NHS but a separate issue to the myth of US style payments
@localpeasant another lazy myth
@jonathansc @MarkReckless also true under Labour, long history of top ups in dentistry
Can anyone identify anyone forced into 'US style' payments for NHS services since 2010? It's a toxic myth that is undermining the Union
.@GdnHealthcare Labour must attack SNP lies on NHS charges; stop putting narrow party Politics ahead of the truth & protecting the Union
@PickardJE it's not Cameron who should resign if the Union is ripped apart; why have Labour put Party politics before saving the Union?
'Yes' camp again equating freedom of speech with loutish intimidation. A taste of things to come? #nothanks we're #bettertogether
For the future of medical research & innovation; don't take the Great out of Britain #bettertogether
Stalking & harassment are deterring women from standing for public roles. Appalling treatment of @NadineDorriesMP http://t.co/EeVN3CwBvv
.@guardian I wrote an open letter explaining why I will support military action but opposed last year; the response highly supportive.
.@PaddyBriggs Last yr spending on public services/person in Scotland £1,128 higher than UK average due to #barnettformula #bettertogether
SNP have cynically manipulated the facts on NHS debate #indyref #realitycheck they have more to spend on health & entirely as per SNP diktat
.@GuidoFawkes  Annual expenditure/per head on health: England £1,912, Scotland: £2,115 & as slippery Salmond knows, wholly devolved.
@chrisg0000 as set out in my open letter, see website
Terrific turnout for public meeting in #galmpton yesterday, understandable anger at mess left by travellers. Also local/national discussion
The international community must act together against this poisonous evil; does anyone want these sadists back? http://t.co/tedNMXsXQl
You wouldn't open or circulate videos of child rape; please don't do so on behalf of sadistic mass murderers. #DavidHaines was a true hero
Remember #DavidHaines as his family would wish http://t.co/z1NCzusT76 not as his murderers want. Don't open just block their vile propaganda
Remember the heroism of #DavidHaines who devoted his life to serve others. Utter contempt for his self-serving murderers

@the_dirty_ho @Puffles2010 @CommonsHealth can you point to any financial COIs for any committee members?
Has the NHS remained free at the point of use, based on need & not ability to pay? @CommonsHealth calls for evidence http://t.co/Dko7CpewEI
@the_dirty_ho @Puffles2010 @CommonsHealth happy to confirm I have no links at all to private health care & never have
@flakesofjam @CommonsHealth follow us both for updates

Come to #brixham for a brill day out tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing @@FishwivesChoirs too http://t.co/1G0JhKgR5K  @Fishstock14
@PickardJE @DuncanWeldon and let the facts get in the way of some toxic rhetoric? If only!
@PickardJE @DuncanWeldon also Scots have more per head from UK govt to spend on health & social care than people in England. SNP talking rot
@PickardJE @DuncanWeldon the only people 'privatising' the Scottish NHS are the SNP as decision making on health policy entirely devolved!
@GdnHealthcare @Priyesh123 worth noting that GPs have always been independent (ie profit making, private) contractors to the NHS since day1
@jillongovt @Robynlmunro it wasn't a criticism of @instituteforgov simply a complement on this piece of work & hope that you will cover it
@_peterriddell @jillongovt @instituteforgov I agree, absolutely needs to be addressed whatever result of #indyref
@phuntphunt93 @matthewrjames I did not ignore opinion on this, I actively campaigned against closure
Fascinating reading from @instituteforgov on what happens after #indyref but doesn't cover the 'English Question' http://t.co/gIK64JPXVp
Another reason why Russia should pull out of Ukraine; to focus on defeating our greatest common threat, #ISIS http://t.co/pA3n6RK7aL
@matthewrjames MPs are deluged by pollsters, like many colleagues I don't take part in them. Poll simply not representative of majority view

@BrigODonKenny spent
@old_man_milford The pound is the currency of the union. It would be Scotland's choice to walk away from that
What's so positive about saying yes to economic ruin for your children when dwindling North Sea Oil revenues dry up? #indyref
More than I can say, I hope Scots vote to stay but the choice is theirs. No one should pretend it would be an amicable divorce
Very sad to hear of the death of Jim Dobbin MP, he was also a tireless campaigner on behalf of sufferers of Benzodiazepine addiction
@OnlyDads thank you for responding though Bob, much appreciated

@craigmiles80 @PlymPavilions the posters on display are different to the one in your link & feature the severed head far more prominently
Posters of man holding woman's severed head with caption 'You'll laugh your head off' FGS, To advertise a children's show?@PlymPavilions
@mrchrisjohn @PlymPavilions have you actually seen the posters?
.@FarmerGeorge26 @PlymPavilions it's not the show, its the posters, which are unbelievably insensitive.
Will @PlymPavilions take down their crass & insensitive advertising for the 'horrible histories' show?
@old_man_milford the point I made in  the letter, had we armed Syrian opposition last year those arms wld prob now be in hands if ISIS
Why I would support military action against #ISIS My open letter to constituents http://t.co/tPp0zs2jg4
@TOTNEZ see my previous tweets & links from today's paper in BJGP with which I agree,
An open letter to constituents on #IslamicState & intervention http://t.co/tPp0zs2jg4

@ClaireWrightInd thanks Claire, full debate online in Hansard
Commons Clerk row is an unseemly mess; it's best to choose your battles.
Parliament debates #communityhospitals 9.30 this morning, so important for our rural communities
.@ProfRWinston have you seen my point of order after last night's debate? I think you are owed an apology. Happy to discuss pls DM contact
@jeremybradley @ProfRWinston has expressed concern about being quoted out of context, I'm interested to know if also applies to the motion
@ProfRWinston I'm interested to know if you were consulted/agreed wording on today's motion quoting you in Commons #Mitochondrial debate?
#Mitochondrial donation is not about parents wanting a child more beautiful or intelligent but about sparing a child a lifetime of suffering
Scientific evidence has been selectively quoted; seems to me those opposed would oppose regardless of further #Mitochondrial research
Sorry to hear terms like 'eugenics', 'designer' & '3 parent babies' used so widely in tonight's debate on mitochondrial donation 1/2
Link to the 3rd scientific review into safety & efficacy of methods to avoid mitochondrial diseases http://t.co/HqKgeyLkLr
@mortycat @theresecoffey Mitochondrial donation has the potential to prevent avoidable suffering & Parliament should not delay IMO
@ianhobkirk seems to me the top priority is to reunite a frightened little boy with his parents but your point is also an important one
@theresecoffey mitochondrial donation about 0.1% of DNA (all of it outside chromosomes) & could prevent untold misery for affected children
@theresecoffey out of interest, will you be calling for a delay in regulations?
Good background reading for tomorrow's Parliamentary debate on importance of mitochondrial donation research http://t.co/pBeDWKCig9
@laidmanr @DouglasCarswell I am dismayed by his decision but reflection on reasons preferable to recriminations/ personal attacks IMO
@EricTheKing1992 to confuse you with the facts http://t.co/Ta7Mfqrc4p
@JohnRentoul @IndyOnSunday completely agree, would have been better to stay & fight for the change not just change to a party of dissent
Message to all would-be sadists: If you burn your passport to murder & rape for #ISIS you will also burn your bridges home #GoodRiddance
2/2 share many of his frustrations at Westminster politics but seriously doubt @DouglasCarswell will find answer to anything is #UKIP
Of course the main winner from @DouglasCarswell defection is Ed Milliband & the opposite of everything it was designed to achieve 1/2
Genuinely sorry @DouglasCarswell has 'Kippered; a thoughtful conviction politician & undoubtedly a loss to the Conservative Party.
@TOTNEZ of course & I do also hold open meetings at weekends next in Galmpton VH Sat 13th 4pm or a surgery if you'd like to meet
@bbclaurak no; we would have seen British weapons in the hands of #ISIS & even more obscene self-justifying recruitment by those murderers
@4Lilyfoundation thanks for your message, I support your campaign to prevent the misery of mitochondrial diseases
Powerful piece from @ianbirrell on why we must not allow Milliband to follow France & take us over the cliff http://t.co/U9RY9Q9kCR
#saatchibill team exploiting Ebola scare & using some dodgy comparisons for medical anecdotes to 'cure' cancer;  http://t.co/Pq9HuLZxYm
Row re #carolmills should not be about #Bercow but about who will best serve our Parliamentary democracy. Pre-appointment hearing essential
If sharing/viewing sadistic murders online, where's your limit? Would you view/ share #IS rape & child murders too? It creates more victims
@RSR108 agree & I'm glad subsidies to v large sites will be cut next yr but we are now highly vulnerable in meantime IMO
@Ian_darbyshire suspect you might if you saw what vast acres of closely packed arrays feels like to a small community surrounded by them
What was needed was a clarification of whether this constituted 'cumulative impact on landscape'; an important principle now left in limbo
As I have raised with DCLG before, district govt approves these monstrosities partly because of massive cost of appeals & penalties.
2/2 IMO simply not good enough to pass the buck to district council. The Qn was whether this was 'cumulative impact' Now opens floodgates
I am dismayed that the Sec of State has failed to call in the planning application for yet another vast solar array near Diptford 1/2
@RealNunners no & nor do I want to. Voyeurism of a real person's sadistic murder? no thanks!
@Obesitysoc no it is not a disability in itself but it is a preventable cause of disability
@Shaaaarps @DavidAllenGreen quite, see later tweet as some have missed the point entirely
@domcgraham the porn creates more victims but I agree with you!
To clarify my last tweet it is not illegal to view or share sadistic murder propaganda but if you do so you help to create the next victim
@bainesy1969 I'm saying it creates more victims
@hsmall your choice but you are helping to create more victims
@Christiane @DavidAllenGreen I'm saying it is creating more victims #dontsharemurderimages
@rjsh11 @allpartycycling I agree! See our report, needs £10 per person long term stable funding
Viewing/sharing child porn is illegal because it creates victims & is morally repugnant; same applies to sadistic murder propaganda images
@rjsh11 I have long supported investment in active travel infrastructure incl work with @allpartycycling
@markhughes prefer calm look at the evidence & look forward to @CommonsHealth inquiry into NHS funding in Autumn
@markhughes Income from private patients in English NHS trusts accounted for 0.7% in 2013-14. It stood at 0.71% in 2010-11 ie it has fallen
@markhughes read to the end of that misleading piece & you will see the facts, it's actually fallen!
So if supplying military support the government should not bypass democratic process IMO  #recallparliament http://t.co/94aIjDxEX6
2/2 Income from private patients in English NHS trusts accounted for 0.7% in 2013-14. It stood at 0.71% in 2010-11 ie it has fallen FGS !
Another misleading piece on NHS from @SocietyGuardian which takes reading almost to end to state the facts 1/2 http://t.co/sDBcxUPu33
#IS tactic of medieval barbarism to create their dystopic caliphate can only be countered by multinational lethal force; #recallparliament
PM must #recallparliament before committing UK to military action beyond humanitarian aid in Iraq
I opposed intervention in Syria as an open ended conflict with risk of escalation & supporting terrorist grps like IS. This is different 1/2
Softening up for further intervention? The demand for help & funding should come from vastly wealthy oil rich States http://t.co/7hgTqnMtkN
Where are the mass demonstrations by the Ummah to register disgust at genocide being carried out in their name? Where is the Arab League?
Rather than pandering to whatever rebrand #ISIS choose why not call it as it is #iFH #IslamoFascistHellhole whatever it is it's not Islam
There's a good reason for S 5.2 of the editors' code; insensitive reporting increases the risk of further tragedies http://t.co/I8kuF40KWk

@TinaCrowson great day apart from biblical rain thanks to storm Bertha but once you're soaked you just can't get any more drenched.

Thanks to Simon Stevens @NHSEngland for visiting Dartmouth to listen to volunteers & discuss community hospitals http://t.co/32MJkm16HR
Chief Exec of NHS England Simon Stevens, is coming to Dartmouth today to visit our community hospital & meet volunteers from across S Devon
@trevstanley interestingly not, but discussed at length at public meeting on previous day in Malborough. Neither audience raised EU
Thanks to everyone who came to a busy open meeting in Marldon today; healthcare issues, road safety, parliamentary reform, education & more
@wsjaeboo @KailashChandOBE @GdnHealthcare GPs have always been independent contractors drawing a profit from the NHS
@wsjaeboo @KailashChandOBE @GdnHealthcare we don't need the dogma of either, just a reasoned debate about the right balance
@wsjaeboo @KailashChandOBE  misleading in use of stats IMO. Cherry picking arguments & overly dogmatic. Surprised @GdnHealthcare ran it
Today I'll be at Marldon Village Hall at 3pm, please join me for an open meeting to discuss any local, national or international issues
@Laurentmurphy good to have your support, as you are based overseas it may be best to contact Conservative HQ via website/email initially
Simon Stevens, CE of @NHSEngland visits #Dartmouth tomorrow to discuss community hospitals & role/funding voluntary sector health partners
@DRoberts44 thanks for your feedback but Gaza's children did not vote for Hamas. We should value their lives too under international law
Wednesday 6th I will be at Marldon Village Hall for an open meeting at 3pm. Please come & share views on local/national/international issues
Thanks to all who came to today's open meeting in Malborough (including Jack the Jack Russell) & to my Totnes surgery http://t.co/rkHaRFxrLf
@andmcdonagh quite, so stop arming #Israel if no ceasefire
@andmcdonagh voted against military action in Syria because it would have resulted in utterly pointless open ended escalation of conflict.
.@nlygo Israel risks winning the battle but losing the war. Huge mistake to underestimate the international revulsion at scenes from #Gaza
@nlygo @tomwilson23 @WikiGuido that of course would be far safer than a UN school or hospital in Gaza
.@nlygo I would argue that today of all days, Israel could & should show some respect for the value of all human lives & declare ceasefire
@robbuckwell clearly not true!
@robbuckwell have already done so on many occasions but the asymmetric scale of this conflict cannot be ignored
.@GBRChris_A time to implement arms embargo as we would do for any other nation acting in this way with deliberate civilian death toll
.@old_man_milford Agree #Hamas share the blame for this slaughter but the response is utterly disproportionate in scale of civilian deaths
Extraordinary that Israel, so dependent on Western support, risks losing it because of utter disregard for the value of civilian lives #Gaza
On a day we pause to remember the fallen of WW1, Israel resumes the mass slaughter of innocents & escalating humanitarian disaster in #Gaza

“@RubyMalvolio: is it similar with SPAD's? Do they go through proper open process or are they hand picked from the parties?” Anyone know?
@RubyMalvolio agree, advertise & interview is fairest way forward so that all applicants can have the opportunity to work in Parliament
@RubyMalvolio I don't employ family members, others will have to speak for themselves but I know many work way beyond contracted hours

@Snow4Snow @Number10gov spending on NHS has been protected & increased in line with inflation. The issue is outstripping rising demand
@Cornishview the point in the article is that we are one of the few NATO allies who do spend the target % of GDP, others need to do likewise

How can front page splash, p5 feature & editorial suggesting an identified child 'branded by Satan' be lighthearted? http://t.co/S3JtX0MkmB
@BBCNews will you be asking @TheSunNewspaper correspondent Kevin Scofield to apologise for today's front page when he reviews tomorrow's?
@Torbay_Hour @Bygones_Torquay @Timatbf @cdhart1 @adriansandersmp I have already raised in Parliament &  agree that tourism VAT should be cut
Serious question @TheSunNewspaper Was any consideration at all given to the risks to/interests of this clearly identifiable child or others?
@Dr_Ellie an interview does not print an entire conversation, it's not an essay or an opinion piece
@GabrielScally @LabourHealth @andyburnhammp TCS remember, orthopaedic centres with cherry picking rates
@GabrielScally @LabourHealth @andyburnhammp so why did Labour sell off so much of the NHS up to 2010?
@Dr_Ellie of course it's all that too but difficult to fit in one tweet + scale of marketing of junk food to children is appalling
@bobrey2009 @MailOnline both need to act
Dept of Health must live up to its name & toughen up 'Responsibility Deal' with the junk food industry @MailOnline http://t.co/sAl3YiVuoH
.@TheSunNewspaper should pull their damaging front page story with photo of a child. He does not carry 'mark of devil' he is a real child!
@theresecoffey fine if they really want to ask/ highlight that point but we all know that both sides circulate tedious questions!
Ending planted questions from both sides would be the best way to have a genuine #peoplesPMQ
@acogofchange doubt it, but all MPs should reject planted questions which waste time with grandstanding at PMQs. Genuine questions please!
@cjsnowdon as many as you like Chris, if packs are smaller & you really want more, just buy 2. Most stick with default & reduce sugar load
So will Ed end planted Labour whips questions at PMQs in run up to election so Labour MPs can genuinely ask their constituents' questions?
@pollypeel @ParvaPower about to do so
Good news “@ParvaPower: Australia sees large fall in smoking after introduction of standardised packs http://t.co/gR9kZDFP1T””
@ewancwatt @devilskitchen nothing, which is why it is not infringing anyone's liberty. Most however choose default & reduce portion size
@NuLabourNemesis @devilskitchen @beludesigns @cjsnowdon your tweet an example of how you have been duped by lobbyists
.@devilskitchen @beludesigns @cjsnowdon someone to challenge all the crap from the lobbying industry, big alcohol & junk food industry?
@JuliaHCox @Jarmann yes & any change in charging policy would require amendment to legislation. 1/2

@Prentiz 'less intrusive' isn't working. Choice now to accept widening health inequality or act on a range of measures for prevention
@Prentiz  my argument was to ban supersizing as part of a range of measures. Scale of problem & health inequality now demands action
@PaulMBarton nothing, but most tend not to do so. What benefit is there to supersizing of high sugar/fat? just fuelling obesity epidemic

Good to hear from Nottinghamshire Police that warning was issued rather than caution for first offence for teenager @bbc5live
Must read from @bengoldacre on statins & behaviour change http://t.co/Jrrq7PrMh7
Cautions/prosecutions are justified for repeat teen offenders sharing indecent images of children but there is a case for PIN use first IMO
@dukkhaboy I agree it causes immense harm & a sinister new form of bullying. Police right to take v seriously but could initially use PIN
@Kenny_young of course, but caution does have serious long term consequences as this will appear in searches & affect job opportunities
2/2 Sexting or posting an indecent image of a child is illegal whoever sends it but some teenagers only see it as criminal if sent by adult
Surely a PIN, Police Information Notice better than giving these children a caution & criminal record? 1/2 http://t.co/wHEXCr9foQ

@MichaelLCrick better to promote her to full cabinet member surely
@JohnRentoul needs an upgrade!
@JohnRentoul what about Baroness Stowell?
@grahphil left off Baroness Stowell
@BenMearns @CommonsHealth the best job of all tbh
@KateMaltby I believe so as replacing Lord Hill who was
No sign of tokenism in any of the appointments of my women Conservative colleagues; very talented, there on merit & congratulations to all
There are 18 Conservative full members of the cabinet & 6 are now women. All appointed on merit
Rail line N of Dartmoor not viable & would be a disaster. Building super resilience to the line looks best value
Gd to hear confirmation that access to mental health therapies will be based on consent. Glad briefings to @Telegraph dumped or were false
Hunt: "it is a particular pleasure to be here this morning" 
IMO a wise decision by @David_Cameron
.@StepStones1995 no I did not, I said IPS is evidence based & we should get on and offer it, just not make MH offer coercive, pls correct
@Scots_Tory @adamboultonSKY I have huge admiration for hard work of ministers but personally really honoured to have @CommonsHealth role
For once having 'the balls to do the job' may be a disadvantage  #reshuffle
In non-reshuffle news.. @CommonsHealth hears from Norman Lamb & Bruce Keogh today at 2.30 for our CAMHS inquiry.
Detaining children in police cells shames us all #newsnight & also being used for S136 mental health Act for children as young as 12
@WilliamJHague an extraordinary Foreign Secretary especially for his work challenging impunity & complacency on sexual violence in conflict
Wonderful news at last not just for women in the Church of England but an example for all faiths on equality
Individual placement and support has a good evidence base so get on and offer it, alongside parity of esteem but forced treatment unethical
Before he starts his reshuffle @David_Cameron needs to reassure those with mental illness that they won't be subject to coercive treatment
Get on with parity of esteem for MH & voluntary Individual support but compulsory treatment unethical & unworkable http://t.co/vKuIzCVLLY

Fab evening ride Torbay Dartmoor Teign Valley #ridelondon training https://t.co/DEfBbrCLKh http://t.co/GkJzRtY95q
Certainly the first question i'd be asking new minister; do they seriously think any compulsory treatment ethical let alone actually work?
Interesting timing of MH benefits/treatment briefing to @Telegraph ; almost as if a poison chalice poured for next DWP incumbent #reshuffle
Piloting offer of Individual Placement & Support IPS would be evidence-based & welcome but compulsory treatment benefit link doomed to fail
When I say it's a 'no brainer' I mean this unethical unworkable kite flying comes from someone with #NoBrain http://t.co/ONYxISSkNH
Also @gmcuk should take dim view of any doctor who prescribes treatment to patient reporting they need it only to comply with benefit rules
Just imagining the increase in prescriptions for antidepressants to 'prove' compliance with treatment. Unethical, unworkable nonsense
@tombarton if more than just R wing kite flying, frankly horrified it would be completely unethical & unworkable & needs urgent correction
.@IsabelHardman Fundamentally flawed as incompatible with principle of consent to treatment & impossible to implement. Needs correcting
Presumably this complete tosh planted by someone who has no understanding of consent to treatment http://t.co/ONYxISSkNH
@margielondon @WMNNews could you email (including address) as a tweet just doesn't give enough detail
@laidmanr @unit_v of course politicians should be discussing it; it would need a change in the law!
.@unit_v far better to make sure double effect principle properly understood by clinicians & patients' wishes to refuse treatment respected
@unit_v because we risk society shifting to see it as irrational/cruel to keep certain people alive. Too easy to become a 'duty to die'
@7rjones7 thanks, I realise its a tough one & public opinion has significantly shifted...so too has the boundary for ending life in NL & S
@7rjones7 I won't support it; the societal risk of such a fundamental shift outweighs individual benefit. Use double effect instead
The balance between an individual's right to decide vs societal risk from a shift to allow assisted suicide should not be dependent on faith

@AlexanderHDH @AMMorrisMP @BenPBradshaw the Okehampton line option would be a disaster for South Devon, we must retain Totnes & Newton Abbot
@pauljebb1 @gracenglorydan @CommonsHealth @gmcuk @nmcnews that he will respond in writing to set out what will be taken forward in 2ndry leg

Loved @Ways_With_Words & meeting Kate Adie to introduce her talk about Fighting on the Home Front; the legacy of women in World War One
@YasarKhan2 in past, used to be able to do these as stand alone posts then add a year in GP training to build own scheme, should allow again
@mankymam @KailashChandOBE indeed but inpatients often have more than one condition with complex interaction between them
@YasarKhan2 not about shortcuts, as it is GPs don't get experience of every hospital specialty; but relevant prior experience should count
@CRoseveare @BenMearns agree, generalists needed in hospitals too because 30% of population have LTCs & often multi morbidity
@JuliaClarke_BCH agree returners schemes would help current workforce shortfall but also need changes to pre & post grad training priorities
@BenMearns yes, but problem starts way back in med school. Training too focused on specialist rather than generalist training in many
.@LeeDHudson in fact the switch to this rigid & expensive training model long predated this government. I'm calling for HEE & NHSE to fix it
@Geoada2011 incredibly no. Just restart at beginning retaining their much higher salary in a junior post which also increases costs to NHS
@nysuri TY, an important point. I'm referring to oversubscribed specialties with few vacancies at end of v long & expensive training
@alisonleary1 importance of specialist nurses highlighted in recent @CommonsHealth report, hugely valued by patients and community teams
Wasteful to make experienced hospital specialist trainees switch back to very start of GP training, previously this was far more flexible
Training too many hospital specialists rather than generalists ignores needs of patients & wastes NHS resources http://t.co/5X695Ntthj
@PublicInvolve agree, including her campaigning against men being able to refuse consent for wives to have life-saving surgery.
Inspired by #EdithCavell ? Well worth reading Kate Adie on the legacy of women in WW1 http://t.co/KED48SKq7N
War office response to surgeon Elsie Inglis who volunteered in 1914, "My good lady, go home & sit still" like #EdithCavell she ignored it
@Rosiecosy @Efrogwraig hence my tweet, congratulations!
#EdithCavell was one of many brave women from WW1, looking forward to introducing Kate Adie's talk & terrific book at #dartington tomorrow
The only thing that's new for the latest shamefest is that she will be hounded forever on social media rather than by a mob with pitchforks
As ever #magalufgirl commentary reflects age old attitudes to controlling women rather than the 24 men also involved.
@andrewhaldenby just not enough robust evidence that it makes the savings that were predicted. Do it to integrate services around people
@andrewhaldenby the efficiencies so far mostly achieved through pay restraint & one off savings, rather than shift to integrated provision
@andrewhaldenby clearly, no point in just adding more cash without necessary changes needed to respond to LTCs, see @CommonsHealth reports
@reformthinktank argued for an honest debate about finance if we are going to keep pace with rising demand
@DouglasCarswell suggest broadening skill mix, encouraging returners & ending wasteful post grad pathways into oversupplied specialties
.@DouglasCarswell to have choice you first need to have supply; there is a serious workforce shortfall in primary care needing urgent action
Looking forward to meeting new chair of #Torbay hospital this morning before constituency surgery this afternoon

@FriendsofGCF please could you contact my office, happy to meet but would stress that I don't have any powers over this planning decision
@discovery77_ in this case I feel the priority lies with police investigation & that does not minimise the importance of this issue
@FriendsofGCF long standing commitment that evening in London & sadly not back in Devon until 2am. Glad you had a good attendance
@discovery77_ not until police investigations & judicial process complete
@jhurstnlp of course not the only answer, need to address all aspects but rapid increase in obesity from reception to year 6 is a concern
@Dr_Ellie completely support need to identify & address variation but 'name&shame' approach risks unintended consequences for patients IMO
@lgbtransaction please could you email
help children before they slip from overweight to obese, let parents know. Cutting sugar not expensive; no child needs an 'energy drink'
Childhood obesity an important cause of health inequality, incr risk of heart d, diabetes, joint probs, some cancers, depression & bullying

@ClinicalStyle not doing so
@ShackletonJon yes, he would not have had the craven access he did in the NHS without that celebrity endorsement within the BBC
Safeguarding checks can't work without a culture shift to always report concerns about abusive or inappropriate behaviour #Savile
Scandal not that no one knew about #Savile but that so many NHS staff heard about, witnessed or assisted in his behaviour and kept silent
Victims of abuse are not silent, just silenced by being ignored especially if their abusers are popular, manipulative celebrities

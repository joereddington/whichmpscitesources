@Dannythefink thanks! Mon Apr 27 08:41:06 BST 2015
Reason Green Party hate us knocking on doors is because they know many Green members voting #ben4exeter in preference to getting Tory MP. Mon Apr 27 08:37:17 BST 2015
@MarinaHyde @patrickwintour & presumptuous to assume everyone in home votes same or might not vote differently in national & local election Mon Apr 27 08:27:39 BST 2015
Ta for amusing & supportive tweets re Exeter Green Party complaining they're "appalled" & "intimidated" cos @exeterlabour knock on doors ðŸ˜Š Mon Apr 27 08:25:07 BST 2015
@HuskieWalleyes exactly! Extraordinary to assume everyone I house votes the same or might not vote differently in local/national election. Sun Apr 26 23:38:47 BST 2015
@jdbeeson16 you should check it out v good piece of work I hope one day will be implemented Sun Apr 26 23:36:10 BST 2015

@SamFawcett92 thanks Sun Apr 26 23:29:42 BST 2015
@jdbeeson16 my personal preference? The system recommended but the Jenkins commission set up under Blair. Very similar to German system. Sun Apr 26 23:18:12 BST 2015
@craigmccrum exactly and it's also presumptuous to assume everyone in a household votes the same. Sun Apr 26 23:12:41 BST 2015
Labour to scrap stamp duty for most first time buyers - a great aspirational policy https://t.co/ShGm5gewDU Sun Apr 26 23:02:21 BST 2015
Only just caught up this - wonderful @Ed_Miliband crushing bumbling Boris Johnson on non-doms & much else http://t.co/SGMozsTYzj Sun Apr 26 22:58:34 BST 2015
Now even Ulster Unionists attack Tories for playing fast and loose with union in desperate attempt to cling to power http://t.co/0oSLd3DDe8 Sun Apr 26 22:53:23 BST 2015
@goughton it seems to be - Exeter Greens - the new Stalinists? Sun Apr 26 22:48:39 BST 2015
@SaraLBennett60 exactly, some Green Party supporters don't seem to think it's possible that people could think differently in a household. Sun Apr 26 22:47:41 BST 2015
@majanovelist thank you! Sun Apr 26 22:46:17 BST 2015
@IanCogings e mail your address ben4exeter@gmail.com or call 424464 if you live in mincinglake ward you should have had 2 ballot papers Sun Apr 26 20:50:48 BST 2015

@ProfJBradshaw holboellia someone has suggested is that the same x Sun Apr 26 12:32:14 BST 2015

Delighted at formation of South West Rail All Party Parliamentary Group for better deal for Westcountry rail timely given #Dawlish report
With Karenza & Beth from Devon supporting #listenup giving children in care a voice at Westminster @ukypdevon http://t.co/EPDegIHXgC
The dispatch to Brussels of Lord Hill,unknown in Britain & male, hardly improves our chances of getting a decent Commission post #reshuffle
Seems Govt to reject SW calls for additional #Dawlish rail route, ignoring economic benefit & impact of climate change. Very disappointing.
"Unthinkable" UK should leave European Convention of Human Rights Ken Clarke @BBCr4today as he says he regrets Grieve's departure #reshuffle
This #reshuffle really does look like a "massacre" of the moderates as the Tories take a dramatic further lurch to the right
Sorry to see Ken Clarke leave Government. Was a rare voice of sanity on Europe in today's Tory Party.
@clivewilcock Support Lords reform. Always have. In mean time shoudnt have all male House of Bishops
@Stephenmevans1 support Lords reform. Always have. In meant time, though, would be unacceptable for House of Bishops to remain all male
@rob9son support Lords reform. Always have. Important in mean time House of Bishops not all male
Great news that @c_of_e finally approves women bishops now need short parliamentary Bill to fast track some into Lords pending Lords reform
Hoping to raise terrible situation in #Gaza in Commons with the Foreign Secretary shortly

@johnmcternan @daily_politics and Merkel's CDU well to left of British Tories

Thanks #Wonford, Blessed Sacrament Church #Heavetree & #Polsloe #Exeter for such great community events yesterday
@DAaronovitch why? Modern Germany is decent, social democratic, relatively equal, peaceable & environmentally conscious. What's not to like?

@BethRigby since disaster of leaving EPP Cameron has consistently misjudged Merkel mix of wishful thinking & appeasing own Europhobes
@georgeeaton yup. As a number of us has been saying it was a fantasy strategy from day 1 & why Ed's so right sticking to his guns on Europe
@trevdick because we believe in the principle that the democratically elected governments of the member states should choose Commission
@cosby_laura really? We & even Major managed to block Commission presidents Britain didn't want. Cameron too weak & isolated to do so.
@IainMcNicol thanks, yes they are & v good too
@demsoc agree
@RussellDutton really? At least Blair & even Major managed to block Commission presidents Britain didn't want. Cameron too weak to do so.
@PaddyBriggs indeed
Isolated & facing humiliation Cameron has badly hurt UK interests & the reformist cause with his antics over Juncker http://t.co/209xT2L1UI
@JohnRentoul on the contrary, not harsh enough. His failure to understand Germany began with withdrawal from EPP, has continued ever since
@JGForsyth this No 10 has consistently miscalculated relations with Germany mix of wishful thinking & failing to stand up to Euro phobes

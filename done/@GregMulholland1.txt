@shane_ewen I have had a word already! Thanks for the feedback Shane, it's useful. Mon Apr 27 14:28:10 BST 2015
@AuntyDoodle @joanne_sweetman @hardingmike that certainly is odd, if that's the case. You can't beat #openair #music! Mon Apr 27 14:13:47 BST 2015
@shane_ewen I didn't like that one either Shane, so asked for it not to be delivered once I discovered it was going out. Mon Apr 27 14:12:33 BST 2015
Another stunning day in #Leeds NW! If u can come & campaign txt 07434 096045 or email hq@gregmulholland.org Thanks! http://t.co/xjnFzRKlmU Mon Apr 27 12:49:05 BST 2015
@Koffee_P thanks for the feedback, do email me the things you don't like, I obviously don't write it, so keen to know what people think. Sun Apr 26 23:27:53 BST 2015
@JoshuaJPE @hulbertmathew it might, if it was remotely honest, but it isn't, a bit like a lot of the local Labour campaign #falsehoods Sun Apr 26 23:23:06 BST 2015
@HulbertMathew I hope so too, we have lots to do! Sun Apr 26 22:59:46 BST 2015

@Caldicot03 the current polling is clearly showing it close between me & Labour with Cons in poor 3rd, so 2010 result just confusing. Sun Apr 26 17:45:17 BST 2015
Great afternoon doorknocking in #Weetwood with great local councillors Sue & Jonathan Bentley & team in the sunshine! http://t.co/UHVxQnfo2c Sun Apr 26 17:37:12 BST 2015

@AnnaMarieWood no, not at all. We've done proper independent polling. It is close with Tory vote collapsing, green & UKIP up from 2010. Sat Apr 25 21:23:59 BST 2015
@cherylkebede1 @Mo_Saqib yes thanks guys! Especially for the half an hour we managed in the rain! #heroes! Hope the sheets not too wet! Sat Apr 25 19:34:28 BST 2015
@AnnaMarieWood fairly close, me just ahead with the Tory vote way down. Sat Apr 25 19:33:17 BST 2015
@JohnWard_Runner if we get Lab/SNP John I'll spend 5 years slagging them off for cuts, austerity & continuing private NHS contracts! Sat Apr 25 19:26:17 BST 2015

@JoRodgers92 ok apologies Jo, I haven't seen this letter, leave it with me & I'll look into it. Greg Sat Apr 25 19:14:40 BST 2015
@AnnaMarieWood the current polling is Lib & Lab close & Tories miles behind & out of it, so 2010 result of no use now, different climate. Sat Apr 25 19:13:15 BST 2015
@AnnaMarieWood yes, I was explaining that that we want to use the most recent & relevant election which was 2014, but Royal Mail said no. Sat Apr 25 19:11:59 BST 2015
@RayGeorgesonL @oylibdems great work Ray & team, well done & thanks! Sat Apr 25 13:26:16 BST 2015
@Neil_Marshall74 thanks Neil! Sat Apr 25 13:25:25 BST 2015

@mathsfed @nomadicadam no, what was wrong was misleading people about why the GPs wanted to close the surgery, which they did. Thu Apr 09 22:29:49 BST 2015

@FloydyP73 @ukpubbitch @kurnialicensing @club_insure thanks Lloyd! Thu Apr 09 11:15:27 BST 2015
@edrennie77 try telling him that Ed & to stop misleading voters over the bedroom tax which I voted against & consistently opposed! Thu Apr 09 10:40:12 BST 2015
@dwj66 @wharfeobserver he was FORCED to apologise or he would have been sued! Nothing honourable in that! Thu Apr 09 10:39:18 BST 2015
@edrennie77 oh come on Ed, he was forced to print leaflets & pay costs! You can't seriously suggest this was a voluntary honourable sorry?! Thu Apr 09 10:17:39 BST 2015
Labour's #false claim shame in #Leeds NW reported in @wharfeobserver today 'Labour Party forced to apologise' #Otley http://t.co/u5fKxMRV1l Thu Apr 09 10:13:17 BST 2015
My @UKLabour opponent has been forced to print & distribute an apology for a false claim he made abt my voting record http://t.co/X4G1nHAvgE Thu Apr 09 09:30:22 BST 2015
@dwj66 ha ha, yes, a done deal - and we both know enough about each other to know either of us will honour that! At least you care! #cheers Thu Apr 09 01:38:35 BST 2015
@dwj66 @pquinn1969 @anoraky thanks Donald! And seriously, we don't agree, but happy to have banter & sometime, win or lose, a pint! Thu Apr 09 01:35:45 BST 2015
@dwj66 @pquinn1969 @anoraky ha ha, not sure that is my strategy! But as I say, we'll see! And in human terms, genuinely, all the best! Thu Apr 09 01:32:34 BST 2015
@dwj66 @pquinn1969 @anoraky thanks Don! We all always need luck - & some talent. So same to you! Thu Apr 09 01:23:44 BST 2015
@dwj66 @pquinn1969 @anoraky you don't like facts Don, but that's fine! Let's see what happens! Thu Apr 09 01:15:50 BST 2015
@dwj66 @pquinn1969 @anoraky I have voted against it being the law, not meaningless 'motions' but I know you'd rather delude yourself Don! Thu Apr 09 01:13:24 BST 2015
@anoraky we'll see, but I have to say, I have lost the respect for you I used I have! So we'll agree to disagree! Thu Apr 09 01:12:28 BST 2015

@NomadicAdam I already know of another and it is utterly disgusting. Email me. Wed Apr 08 22:09:12 BST 2015
@anoraky I don't though! Labour introduced them! And top-up fees! But why duck the reality of the falsehood, forced apology & legal costs? Wed Apr 08 22:08:45 BST 2015
@NomadicAdam happy to chat properly to you Adam & I stand on my record, but a line has been crossed, twice and disgracefully. Wed Apr 08 22:07:28 BST 2015
@NomadicAdam just wait till his next falsehood comes out. If you think that's okay, that is very bizarre. Wed Apr 08 21:56:10 BST 2015
@pquinn1969 @anoraky except I didn't, but it seems that truth has little meaning to some people!! Wed Apr 08 21:55:23 BST 2015
@NomadicAdam not debating what? Sorry you've lost me. Wed Apr 08 21:53:17 BST 2015
@anoraky I carry on calling for a genuine graduate tax. Labour's policy is incoherent. I didn't realise you were a blinkered party man? Wed Apr 08 21:52:31 BST 2015
@NomadicAdam I stand on my own record Adam, ten years of action. I don't need to put false things in leaflets. Wed Apr 08 21:40:37 BST 2015
@anoraky and by the way, the difference is I DO say that this Govt got some things wrong - and had the balls to say so & vote that way! Wed Apr 08 21:38:45 BST 2015
@anoraky are you being serious?!! He didn't at all!! He was forced to - and pay £2000 costs!! Still so supportive?! Wed Apr 08 21:37:59 BST 2015

@marksilverman33 @freeman_george don't bother complaining to George, Mark - he will just pass it to NHS England & say he can't do anything. Tue Apr 07 09:13:00 BST 2015

@Davehaymot @pjgoodman actually applications r up including from lower incomes. So agree graduate tax & no fees but not Labour's gimmick. Sat Apr 04 20:07:00 BST 2015
A big #thanks to everyone who came out to help me & @LeedsNWLibDems! A good first week of the campaign! Keep it up! Sat Apr 04 19:05:35 BST 2015
@Davehaymot @pjgoodman indeed, not far off the current system, just needs to be made an actual graduate tax. Sat Apr 04 18:53:56 BST 2015
@Davehaymot @pjgoodman...only that takes away the perceived large debt, Labour's incoherent plans don't & seriously underfunds universities. Sat Apr 04 18:10:12 BST 2015
@Davehaymot @pjgoodman hi Dave, my view is that we need current progressive repayment terms but as a graduate tax with no fees... Sat Apr 04 18:07:26 BST 2015

@OtleyChamber yes we need to get that sorted. Will keep pushing for a proper review & real solutions. Fri Apr 03 17:19:40 BST 2015
@Doctorwhizz @StuartLong01 thank you! And to you! Fri Apr 03 17:17:22 BST 2015
@Undercover_mole indeed Fri Apr 03 13:16:32 BST 2015
@lmconstantine2 I would certainly vote for further change to outlaw exploitative contracts. Fri Apr 03 13:16:21 BST 2015
@kam_hussain5 @leedsnwlibdems thanks Kam! And for your support & help! Fri Apr 03 13:15:36 BST 2015
@fadingsanta @lifelandlady @bbcleeds @richardstead yes agreed, we need sensible reform to stamp out exploitation. Fri Apr 03 12:55:12 BST 2015
@cogload519 @leedsnwlibdems thanks James! Fri Apr 03 12:29:46 BST 2015
@fadingsanta @lifelandlady @bbcleeds @richardstead the point is we need fair non exploitative flexible contracts & outlaw exploitative ones. Fri Apr 03 12:29:28 BST 2015
@fadingsanta @lifelandlady @bbcleeds @richardstead this was the point I was making, that it is more complex than the media portray. Fri Apr 03 12:27:22 BST 2015
@Matt_K_Burton thanks Matt, delighted you called in & if reelected I will certainly raise this important issue. Have a nice Easter. Fri Apr 03 12:21:38 BST 2015
@Undercover_mole thank you. Will certainly keep pushing & hope cross party support to get sensible change. Fri Apr 03 12:20:49 BST 2015

@PapaPownall @bbcleeds @richardstead I had my adoption meeting Mark so didn't see it, only snippets on the news. Fri Apr 03 11:32:26 BST 2015
@lmconstantine2 exploitative ones should be stopped, minimum agreed hours flexible contracts are okay if both employer & employee want it. Fri Apr 03 11:32:05 BST 2015
@TheoKL @pollygary @matt77armstrong ha ha, thanks Theo! Not sure about that! Fri Apr 03 11:05:14 BST 2015

@Undercover_mole thank you, I agree about Harold. So that means a lot. Fri Apr 03 01:41:15 BST 2015
@GerardChoo hi Gerard, I wasn't able to watch them as I had my adoption meeting. How did it come across? Fri Apr 03 00:38:55 BST 2015

@_laurasmith46 @nhsengland yes, even though I asked Anthony Prudhoe to his face & he said they would. Utter disgrace #FundOurDrugsNow Thu Mar 26 15:19:32 GMT 2015
@Billinge_pete @alljoinjack @richardnoone @Freeman_George @NHSEngland @andyburnhammp care for all...unless you have an ultra rare disease! Thu Mar 26 15:15:44 GMT 2015
@agtlaw you are missing the point of the proposals, if you want a serous chat we can but I am suspicious - & your profile pic doesn't help! Thu Mar 26 15:15:06 GMT 2015
@agtlaw think we know whose side (literally) you are on here! You know many careless driving charges should have been dangerous. Thu Mar 26 14:55:38 GMT 2015
We told @freeman_george that @nhsengland are misleading him, ignoring clinicians & snubbing drug companies. Not on! Time to step in George! Thu Mar 26 14:22:00 GMT 2015
This is what clinicians & drug companies think of @NHSEngland attitude to ultra rare disease drug approval #shambles http://t.co/L8bTi2HHFU Thu Mar 26 14:02:20 GMT 2015
The bungling bureaucrats at @NHSEngland are STOPPING clinical based decision making for these drugs! A failed process failing families. Thu Mar 26 14:00:04 GMT 2015
Why did Anthony Prudhoe tell me @NHSEngland would attend today then noone came?! Utter disgrace, no #accountability #fundourdrugsNOW Thu Mar 26 13:58:09 GMT 2015
Disgusted with @NHSEngland #cowards who refused to meet me & @MPSSocietyUK @MDUK_News @UKTSA @ActionDuchenne @alljoinjack @duchenneCT Thu Mar 26 13:53:49 GMT 2015

@arctosouthstand would be an honour! Thu Mar 26 13:29:05 GMT 2015
@anoraky not what I said, but not sure that matters, you have very set views, which is fair enough! Thu Mar 26 01:38:12 GMT 2015
@PWH93 thanks Peter, a pleasure! Thu Mar 26 01:36:41 GMT 2015
@anoraky there has always been a need for charity, probably always will be, would be much worse if the country was still in an economic mess Wed Mar 25 21:20:25 GMT 2015

@MelissaReedYork thanks Melissa!
@allanconneryork thanks Allan
@pquinn1969 I think technically that's what we did! #smashandgrab @FairDeal4Locals #stealth warriors! We #madepubhistory!
This is some big door we have just kicked down people! And it isn't going to get shut in our faces & locked again! @FairDeal4Locals
@lingard13 @propensity @julianhuppert thanks Matt
...It said there are two ways to succeed, one to climb up the staircase of preferment on your belly or kick the door down. I'm a doorkicker.
A memorable thing that inspired my desire to enter #politics was an article by @MatthewParris3 I read when an A-level politics student...
.@MarkAMcGann @beerandpub @thetimes The #BigBrewersandPubcoAlliance is finished after this. Totally #discredited & #mistrusted. #Itsover
@propensity @julianhuppert Thanks Matt
@YorkshireGrey indeed! Here's to a better future for #pubs!
Astute piece by @nilspratley in @guardian ignoring the campaign of #misinformation by #pubco mouthpiece @beerandpub http://t.co/Uaa1iFyOcK
Against backdrop of misleading #scaremongering by #pubco mouthpiece @beerandpub, astute truthful @thetimes editorial http://t.co/V183k1SF9i

I have welcomed the rejection of the #MoseleyWood planning application http://t.co/G00InkDbFi
@RobWillock @sachertorte77 @punchpubs ha ha, I bet. I think some at @beerandpub will be calling recruitment agencies! #taxi! #gameover
@AdrianYalland so did you, could not have done it without you! You are a #pubhero! @FairDeal4Locals we #madepubhistory!
@nickbse @camra_official thanks Nick! We #madepubhistory #MulhollandsLaw @FairDeal4Locals

It's #MulhollandsLaw! @FairDeal4Locals #madepubhistory & won a fight for #justice & #fairness http://t.co/zEz7hnFpgf
I may not get an Honour like G.E. Tuppen for "services to the #pub industry" but a few #pubco licensees may buy me a #pint! #MulhollandsLaw
@ajheyes50 @wbandbeer @camra_official thanks Andy
@RajKumaravfc thanks Raj
@ChrisasDickens thanks Chris, we #madepubhistory #MulhollandsLaw @FairDeal4Locals
@ayestotheright @williamjhague thanks Tony & thanks Ministers for accepting clear will of the House & to all @FairDeal4Locals supporters!
@RobWillock really good comment piece by the way Rob, amazing you managed to both capture the mood & balancing views. Top class journalism.
@WBandBEER @camra_official we've done it Tom, now we must make #PubsMatter, #planning reform must happen before the general election!
@RobWillock @engineerlondon definitely a naughty boy!  When I am, my mum calls me Gregory.
BREAKING NEWS: Announcement in @HouseofCommons: Govt accept NC2 & @FairDeal4Locals! It is going to happen folks! We have #madepubhistory!
In the chamber for @bisgovuk topical questions.
@FRESHRANGE thank you!
@mkflint thanks Matthew!
Oh dear #pubco mouthpiece @BrigidSimmonds of @beerandpub exposed misleading people AGAIN! Well said @petebrownbeer http://t.co/HqPL7Zjfoj
@keithpp alas you are not wrong Keith! But yesterday, we beat it!
@AngusMacNeilMP @ft @FT bit p**rpoor that I wasn't even credited a mention! Why bother call me then? Factually wrong too!! NOT end to tie!!
Some good MPs on all sides of House, one is @stevebarclaymp who I've worked with on #justice for criminal driving victims & @FairDeal4Locals
@offiebob thanks Bob it's been a remarkable campaign & taken huge amounts of time. Hope I've done #Mulholland name proud! #MulhollandsLaw
@oldmudgie it's the industry accepted survey! It is also clear from the many pubco accounts I have see. #pubco leased model double #ripoff
@offiebob indeed cousin Bob! Hope you are pleased at the thought of #MulhollandsLaw! @FairDeal4Locals
Why are so many journalists parroting the #pubco untruth that tied licensees get a lower rent for higher beer prices? http://t.co/km1g32ItEH
@Louisjsgill Thanks Louis!
@Baldyluv Thanks Rob! Just get sick of the nonsense & misinformation, baseless scaremongering.
@swaccountants thanks Darren, much appreciated!
I'll certainly be going & taking the family to @JamiePeacock10's #testimonial @leedsrhinos v @officialbullsrl at #Headingley! What a #legend
@Tyson_Beerhound no, @davidnuttallmp voted for NC2 which makes him a @FairDeal4Locals @CAMRA_Official #pubhero! Thanks David!
@BertyBex Hi Rebecca, am writing to the Council on this, chatted to your grandma on Sat. Apols for delay been super busy defeating the Govt!
@samdwebber yes happy to Sam. When is deadline?
In the chamber for #PMQs.
@rhncafc @bbc5live okay well you're entitled to your view, of course! All the info is out there to see, just sharing some. All the best.
@BradfordBrewery thank you!
@rhncafc @bbc5live it isn't possible to disprove things in a 5 min interview so the need was to expose the guff. See http://t.co/vCjF6TOtaI
@caronmlindsay thank you Caron! A great victory for commonsense, for pubs and for justice!
@rhncafc @bbc5live sorry, I have just enough of the dishonesty. It has destroyed many pubs & ruined lives. So yes, I am angry about it.
@thewharfmacc ha ha thanks, sounds good to me! Follow my pub work at @ThePubChampion
@ricklph thanks Rick
@rhncafc @bbc5live for more info see attached http://t.co/QpGwILd6N1
@arostron thanks Andrew!
@rhncafc @bbc5live see the @FairDeal4Locals campaign & information for the reality on the appalling #pubco tied model.
@rhncafc @bbc5live sorry, but I just won't have someone saying things that are so baseless & misleading. It's gone on for years. A #scam.
@Dickybails thanks Richard
According to #pubco lobbyist @BrigidSimmonds a pubco tied lease is a cheap way to take a pub!! Tell that to the many who've lost thousands!
#pubco lobbyist @BrigidSimmonds claims #pubco buying power is key, yet they sell on to own tenants at huge above market price mark-up! #scam
According to #pubco mouthpiece @BrigidSimmonds @beerandpub #pubco tied model is "flexible"! So absurd she must be @FairDeal4Locals mole!
@andy_mulholland @theferrytavern thanks Andy, you especially can toast #MulhollandsLaw! We #madepubhistory
Yet more baseless & wholly misleading #scaremongering from #pubco lobbyist @BrigidSimmonds of the so called @beerandpub on @bbcradio4 #Today
@LukeBagofNails @jasonmccartney Jason is an excellent MP, in parliament & locally. Proud to work with him.
@WheresWallin I like #Coleslaw, but I am #English so it is not 'slaw'! #mulhollandslaw
@andrewdsteer they will
@samdwebber just doing my job in the interests of common sense, society and liberty
So all in the #pub sector are clear, the Govt couldn't get away with trying to reverse the @fairdeal4locals #voterreform vote, no chance!
I've got really bad news for the #pubcos & their #mouthpiece @beerandpub, the #elected House has spoken, no chance of reversing it!
@andrewdsteer thanks Andrew!
@LeedsCAMRA hello fellow #Leeds #CAMRA colleagues & friends. How do you feel that a @LeedsCAMRA member has changed the law to help #pubs?

@CrockartMP @rtaylor_libdem sorry Mike, but know you are a @FairDeal4Locals #pubhero! We #madepubhistory
For those who don't know the #pubco model, I've met many pubco licensees tonight who've been in tears, #justice at last @FairDeal4Locals
Pathetic the way that the #pubcos & their discredited #mouthpiece the #BBPA are already putting out utter nonsense about #marketrentonly!

The #beerage finally losing their grip on the #British #establishment, too many people angry at #pub closures due to #pubco model. RT
For years #pubcos & #beerage have controlled some MPs & parties. But times are a changing. Too many MPs see the #truth & will #voteforpubs
We are but 5 months from the #generalelection, party #whips losing their sway! MPs who want to get #reelected will #rebel & #voteforpubs!

@PubsofUlster I'm absolutely delighted that I'll be there! As UK #SavethePub Chair @ThePubChampion I want to support #NorthernIreland #pubs!
@DaveMorgan25 @jimmyhennigan you shud've been there Dave! I did ask @chrisjlovell, but these days he has better fish to fry! ;)
@NorthOfAWall @england_rl not at all for me. We need #England recognising in the UK constitution then local devolution. Not either/or, both!
@RealJunkFood good luck, I hope you succeed.
@benfeathers @camra_official ha ha cheers Ben! But tell all your mates elsewhere to email their MP so say #voteforpubs & a @FairDeal4Locals!
@FazalNaushad @camra_official @FairDeal4Locals thanks Nash!
@wapurvis @john_ferrett from a Labour side @adrian_bailey @tobyperkinsmp & @ianmurraymp v strong on this. Ian is a former pubco publican!
@wapurvis @john_ferrett thanks Will. John the point is: many pubs that are failing under the pubco model could succeed with @FairDeal4Locals
@ajheyes50 @hdawnee @chloesmithmp @philipdaviesmp Philip was one of the first names on the @FairDeal4Locals New Clause 2!

Major lobbying campaign launched to end the #pubscandal & get a @FairDeal4Locals http://t.co/GD8lfMJKNb MPs can #voteforpubs 18/11 RT
@JFLorg @bristolfighter @communitiesuk exactly. It needs a simple change to permitted development rights, DCLG not interested.
@planning4pubs indeed but alas @communitiesuk are not interested, hiding behind #ACV #figleaf & blaming councils. It needs simple law change
Today @CommonsPASC have our annual review of the work of @PHSOmbudsman @julietmellor and Mick Martin, PHSO managing director. #PASC
Leading fight in Parliament for #FairDeal4YourLocal. Big vote next Tues! MPs must #voteforpubs, not greedy pubcos! http://t.co/IfufrkXIJS
@Richardkharker I'll turn your house into one if you're not careful! Remember Richard, I know where you live! Ha ha ;)
@bristolfighter @communitiesuk as usual, nothing to do with us gov! Taking about the pitifully weak 'right to bid'. Just making excuses.
Asked @communitiesuk why they allow valued #community #pubs to be turned into #supermarkets with no say for local people-they must stop this
In the chamber for @communitiesuk questions
Does your MP support #pubs or greedy #pubcos? Tell them they must #voteforpubs & NC2 & @FairDeal4Locals on 18/11! RT http://t.co/qSw5U7mkyV

@nick_freeman I think if the traffic is this bad as a result, amendments will be essential.
@jonnieblissett @westyorksfbu will certainly look at this Jonnie
@nick_freeman Hi Nick, yes real concerns about this, I said the Council should stop work & revise proposals. Worrying for traffic & buses.

@Wyrdtimes @ianeastleeds England should decide devolution model for England, local areas should choose their local model.
@Wyrdtimes @ianeastleeds yes absolutely, we need devolution to England & local, not an either. Have always called for both!
@Becquerel235 interesting, would like to see that. Thanks.
@JonnieGitAhhr think I should be supporting you Jonnie! Looking forward to it though!
@sarahlicity @DavidWardMP just got this Sarah, drop me an email. Good to see you on Sat!
@gselmer @hmtreasury thanks George!
@ianeastleeds a good idea! I think we need several models to put to people, various different ways it could be done.
There are MPs of all parties working together to get changes in the law to get #justice for victims of criminal driving. Meeting on 1/12.
In @aloksharma_rdg's debate on #dangerousdriving offences, raising the @JStillcampaign & the need for #justice for victims & their families.
The last Lab Govt said #Leeds could only have a bus based transport system, which led to #NGT. We need #devoYorks so we decide best system.
Just said in @hmtreasury Qs that as well as #devomax & #devoManc we also need & want #devoYorks! Time for real powers to #Leeds & #Yorkshire
In the chamber for @hmtreasury questions.
@stephbreakfast @accessibleleeds @yorkschildren the one with Nathan & you is much better Steph! Nathan & I are both agreed on that! :)
@lyha_LisaP @stepchange @yorkshirepost yes we need local & national action to address this.

@sleepymrsp okay will have a look, happy to meet too to discuss.
@SlingerSharon at some stage happy to give you my thoughts on what the EU and pro European people must do to avoid drift to exit
@SlingerSharon because that isn't going to help the EU or me! I believe we should have a referendum, then the In campaign would do just that
@NomadicAdam not at all, drop me an email & I will explain the reality of this issue. I support real recall, not rich man's free for all.
@gem_turner hi Gemma, yes look forward to meeting & to the event in December!
@BradleyEscorcio keep up the good work Bradley (& next time you are down, you should all stay long enough for a quick drink!). Safe journey.
Hope to meet @gem_turner next time too!
Great to meet with @AidanGrills @TomDixon53 @BradleyEscorcio @gogovus @georgebradley32 @fionamet, lots of exciting plans for @LeedsUniUnion!
@LeedsUltraMan thank you!
@EngineerLondon thanks James!
We need a @DHgovuk Minister response on criticism of the disastrous #SafeandSustainable review & abuse of #whistleblowing.
I raised a point of order asking for a statement from a @DHgovuk Minister on the report into the #Leeds children's heart unit suspension.
In the chamber for #PMQs
@UKPatchwork thank you!
@DannyFrank13 @rnli well done Danny
#Leeds children’s heart unit can finally move on but @NHSEngland must learn lessons from their serious errors.
http://t.co/hz9ZQYEz1s
@qprdave1234 good question Dave, because the House was sitting as a committee, not as the House. It's called Committee of the whole House.
My constituent surgeon Stuart Calder died a hero trying to save others in the Cornwall surf tragedy, a tragic loss to his family & #Leeds
Deeply saddened to hear constituent, eminent surgeon Stuart Calder was a victim of the Cornwall surf tragedy. Thoughts & prayers with family

Late one tonight. A lot going on at the moment so stuck in the office till quarter to one. At least it's a lovely night for a #walk!
I support David Heath MP's amendment introducing a public trigger for recall & will vote for it if called & then at next stage of the bill.
@FragileHearts2 sorry to hear that.
@FragileHearts2 tomorrow's report is dealing with this isn't it. Pleased it is addressing all your cases & hope it brings some closure.
@FazalNaushad okay will have a look
@pigeonfalling hi Rosie, have you emailed me? I have been emailing everyone who has contacted me.

@FragileHearts2 @lthtrust @nhsengland can send again if needs be, let me know
@FragileHearts2 @lthtrust @nhsengland I sent you the reply I received on 14 August. Jane replied to say thanks.
@FragileHearts2 @LTHTrust @NHSEngland everything should be answered & addressed! I had replies to my letters we discussed.
@jamesmb so you think #rugbyleague fans are all joke stereotypes do you? You sad Tory fool. Grow up.
@Phoenixarc @HouseofTwits you know that isn't the case...& who any t**t might be! (Twit obviously)
@HarryStopes exactly!
@CllrJohnFox @kam_hussain5 @kathpinnock thanks John!
@FragileHearts2 @lthtrust @nhsengland I listened & took forward what you told me. You need to stop fighting people who do!
@HarryStopes well I see your point, but he does represent Knutsford which is in the north of England!
Funny how #northern #MP George Osborne is desperate to bring American Football to the UK but has done nothing ever to support #rugbyleague!
@FragileHearts2 @lthtrust @nhsengland they should always be listened too & responded to.
Huge thanks to the lovely @TheHorseFarrier #Otley for this evening, as ever lovely #food, superb #beer & great service! See you soon!
Great night tonight with #Baroness @kathpinnock, launching @LeedsNWLibDems 2015 election campaign! Thanks Kath! http://t.co/kCs8Y7PMEz
@kam_hussain5 @kathpinnock thanks for coming Kam, great to have you there! Please send my best wishes to your Dad! #legend
@FragileHearts2 @lthtrust @nhsengland as I have always made clear, we need much more transparency & accountability in the NHS, so yes.
@FragileHearts2 I sent my views to Sky. This should all be in the public domain & such concerns must be investigated & resolved.
@davepatersonupa @cherylkebede1 @foodaidnetwork well done Dave, a great initiative
A very happy #Diwali to all #Sikh, #Hindu and #Jain friends in #Leeds and around the world!

@3chordboy @threeuk thanks Ryan!
@whisperair thanks!

Sick of @TMobile deciding I have exceeded so called 'fair use' policy, so looking to switch away from them. Any advice on better providers?
It is our monthly @UKParliamentRL meeting tonight, delighted to have Victoria Momsen from @wests_tigers as our special guest! #rugbyleague
@FragileHearts2 @jasonmccartney the whole point is that we think it should have concluded already, that is in everyone's interests.
At the @CBINorth annual #Yorkshire & the Humber reception in the @HouseofCommons
I said that the new review must be fair & open & allow all heart units inc #Leeds to reach required standards @SaveOurSurgery @CHSurgeryFund
In health Qs I raised @nhsengland's catalogue of errors re #Leeds Children's Heart Unit, will we get apology? @SaveOurSurgery @CHSurgeryFund
In @DHgovuk #Health questions @JasonMcCartney & I have asked questions on the #Leeds Children's Heart Unit. @SaveOurSurgery @CHSurgeryFund
@chr1sdb @otley_exclusive @russian_bob yes I have written to the Council, bus services could be hugely disrupted. Need an urgent rethink.
Today we have a one off @CommonsPASC session with John Pullinger of @UKStatsAuth, the National Statistician http://t.co/oZIFEouht5 #PASC

@CllrJohnFox @ukpatchwork thanks John
@theVPNbloke Hi Jonathan, have written to the Council today about this.
@juliecarrack @it_rob @otleyretweets yes Julie, that is my big concern, could also have a serious effect on local buses.
Well done to team from Handyfit for doing a charity bag pack till 3pm at Morrison's #Yeadon for @age_uk @AgeUKLeeds http://t.co/wYtndRPu4j
@it_rob @otleyretweets yes I think you are right, don't know what projections were done. Also not sure why Nelson Street included, will ask
@Gus_Baldwin thanks Gus, it does work well people just stop & raise things.
@it_rob @otleyretweets yes then driving to Yeadon. I will be writing to the Council on Monday.
Today I have my 3rd Saturday drop-in advice surgeries 11am-12pm at Sainsbury's #Otley & 12:30-1:30pm at Morrison #Yeadon
@jb81 will do, that is to do with Garnett's development
@jb81 I have heard that a lot of people are not happy, will write to the Council.
Big thanks to @iswales for being guest speaker at the @LeedsNWLibDems dinner @thegranarycafe, great food & night! http://t.co/EaegYX8rMl
@RobStewart_ @bbcleeds @alzheimerssoc thanks Rob
@jb81 Walkergate has been a bone if contention for a long time, will ask Highways Dept to explain their reasons to you.
Honoured to be nominated @UKPatchwork's 'MP of the Year'. Great organisation, doing great work on social mobility. http://t.co/ozFEKguJi8
@NomadicAdam Hi Adam, good to have you back. I certainly support recall & will be involved in trying to strengthen the Bill.
Today I have my 3rd Friday advice surgeries at the @cardigancentre1 #Headingley & the Robert Craven Hall, #Bramhope.
@FazalNaushad yes it a serious issue that needs addressing
@tomdambachICS Hi Tom, happy to! Can you email me on greg@gregmulholland.org to arrange?
@Khopea @simonmagus @leedscitizen @lbiairport yes, we definitely want the link to Guiseley too to provide through trains to Bradford too.
@patterfloof @simonmagus @lbiairport @leedscitizen that is genius!
@CrossroadHollym @fozzythebear1 great to meet you Andy! Delighted you are the latest @AnimalsRL squad member! Now we need Fozzy to stand...
@Mattdavelewis we will keep pushing till we do Matt! We must and will get the @LBIAirport rail link! Thanks for your support! #Leeds
@SimonMagus @lbiairport because it costs a lot more & is more difficult. Unless we get phase 1, no chance of ever getting phase 2!
@MartinWalker666 @lbiairport the link would be south of the Bramhope tunnel to a new Airport station, so links Leeds + Harrogate & York.
@Khopea @simonmagus @leedscitizen @lbiairport yes absolutely, which is why we need the rail link direct to York
@SimonMagus @lbiairport any rail link means you can get from both to the airport. Phase 1 Leeds Harrogate line, phase 2 Guiseley & Bradford.
We also need #electrification of the #Leeds-#Harrogate-York line as well as the @LBIAirport #rail link. Huge potential for the city region.
With a city region economy worth over £50billion, we should be able to make the decision to build the rail link to @LBIAirport locally!
As the MP whose constituency the airport is in, I fully support a rail link to @LBIAirport, great to hear support from MPs across the region
Joining in @StuartAndrewMP's debate on transport links to @LBIAirport, we need a rail link & electrification on #Leeds #Harrogate #York line
@leedstidal pleasure!
@KrisHamer @houseofcommons thanks Kris!
In the @HouseofCommons Chamber for #PMQs.
@VIPGills @2fingersbrewing @prostateuk a great cause! #MenUnited
@Nielsdad @sandylay that's not reasonable, I will liaise with Sandy over taking this up.
@IWPSLeeds even better than that, why don't I come in to share them?
@robclulow @BritishCycling I will if I can!

@GarethBHughes thanks Gareth, what comments are these?
In the @houseofcommons chamber for #DPMQs, I have question 13 on devolution to #Leeds & #Yorkshire.
@socialsuccess71 @leedsindieboy @bingleylife @leedscamra @crash_records @oxjam_leeds great to hear! Well done all involved!
@HelenmHudson @bodkin63 @westminster I certainly support this, didn't hear what was going on today though.
@jon_gleeson @animalsrl our secretary @mark_ramsdale would be delighted to add you to the list! Rules are easy! Just catch and run!
@jon_gleeson I also see you are a #rugby playing councillor, which means you must play for @animalsrl! Union players very welcome!
@jon_gleeson @thewesterngaz @punchpubs excellent, can you send me a photo/scan, thanks!
.@UKParliamentRL are neutral club-wise but I am pleased for our Secretariat & @AnimalsRL manager @Mark_Ramsdale that @Saints1890 won!
@Oxjam_Leeds @leedsindieboy @LeedsCAMRA @Crash_Records might even play for you next year...! Have a great night!

@botzarelli @dehavilland @ptegsupportunit have said before we need to look at integrated system inc rail/light rail/bus/cycling/walking!
@Rob_Merrick @bbcrichardmoss the decision not announced till November, process should be halted by Liberal Democrats now, still time.
@juliecarrack yes, including the rail link from the Leeds Harrogate York line. Time to get on with building that.
@cyberspice yes, it is time we had one - and the right one.
@botzarelli @dehavilland a good article. In the @ptegsupportunit I called for the scrapping of the #Trolleybus project & an alternative.
@juliecarrack good question! At least there won't be a debate at a second runway at Leeds Bradford as there isn't room!

@supernash69 @TristramHuntMP yes to give time for AS to be refitted to new exams
@cmchughlabour I got Govt to reveal result of workload survey they tried to suppress- it's a real issue-we'll work with the profession on it
@emmaannhardy @Joga5 and so they should
@Joga5 @emmaannhardy The values should be the same -the fact that Heads say they aren't shows there is value in agreeing and restating them
@Joga5 @emmaannhardy yes this is about values
@emmaannhardy absolutely not
@emmaannhardy that's exactly what it's about
@janetmarland @KateMrsnash the Nolan Principles - breached too frequently I'm sad to say
@sharpeleven well at least we share the guitar and mandolin in common and that is also not intended as an insult!
@sharpeleven on the contrary that this govt has undermined that professionalism by saying you don't need a qualification
@KateMrsnash as a former teacher why an agreed statement of the ethical underpinning of teaching is an 'insult' baffles me
@supernash69 @KateMrsnash no need for bureaucracy - why not have a serious and concise statement of agreed values on every staff room wall?
@KateMrsnash @supernash69 @TristranGordon insisting on qualified teachers & strengthening the profession with fair treatment for all schools
@KateMrsnash @supernash69 the one could help to enable the other
@supernash69 quite right!
@supernash69 this is the opposite - it's about underpinning not undermining professionalism
@supernash69 @johndavidblake @emmaannhardy @Mishwood1 @TristramHuntMP certainly not by politicians - this is about professionalism
@smithkc1966 @cyclingkev @TristramHuntMP why not all? The same values should apply to school leaders -
@graham_pointer as a former teacher having stated set of values to call on against those undermining the profession could be valuable
@smithkc1966 @cyclingkev @TristramHuntMP what's wrong with teachers setting out in clear form the ethics that underpin the profession?
@emmaannhardy @Mishwood1 @TristramHuntMP something drawn by consensus could help teachers in face of undermining of profession by others

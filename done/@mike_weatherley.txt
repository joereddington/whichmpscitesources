@albionroar And meeting Minister in June. When you miss a Press Release you do it in style
@albionroar The point is that the DofE want the Council to say where they would prefer the new school. Green Council refuses to say. Why?!
@bhasvicfield PACA have plans for specialist facility in 3. There are other viable sites. Council needs to engage & not just blame Gove
@jasonkitcat @bhasvicfield So in summary Jason you're NOT working with DfE to find alt site. You just dont want this Free School anywhere
@bhasvicfield @jasonkitcat Indeed. Come on Jason what's your plan? What site do you have mind? Or are you all 'throwing blame and no plan'?
@jasonkitcat If you are helping then you won't mind telling us all what your preferred alternative site is. @bhasvicfield would like to know
Hoping to go and see Rush play in London next week. What gigs are you looking forward to?
Facts: Hove needs new school & DofE want help as to where to put it Q: Why is B&H Green Administration refusing to find alt to BHASVIC site?
@CarolineLucas EDM fails to highlight Local Council failure in finding alternative site This needs to happen We need new school & solution
@elizabethdwiar Hi Elizabeth - comment was in relation to EDM and MPs signing, not local petition.
@brighton118 @bhasvicfield DofE have made it clear they would welcome alternative site proposals. B&H Council must engage and recommend alt
@sevenbeescafe Hi Iain EDM needs to recognise role Local Council has in all this - they responsibility to help find alternative site as well
@Ethixbird @bhasvicfield Hi Bobbie. That referred to MP signatories to EDM
@bhasvicfield All signatories are only interested in attacking Govt. Pls put equal pressure on Council to engage and help find a new site
@bhasvicfield Indeed. I am doing all I can via constructive means like meeting Minister. Using this to bash Govt and Gove is not helpful
@lizziee_tim Friday 2pm. Hove Town Hall
@bhasvicfield EDM misses out calling on Green Administration to provide solution. Ranting at Gove is not the answer. Finding alternative is

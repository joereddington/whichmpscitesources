Typical tactic to deflect from the truth: Royal Mail botch job with mates rates to city and massive loss to taxpayer from the sale
PM wrong at PMQs re Labour's 2010 manifesto: "continuing modernisation & investment will be needed by the Royal Mail in the public sector"

BUDGET LATEST: Osborne's budget offers nothing to deal with the #costoflivingcrisis #CostofCameron #Budget2014 http://t.co/B8OIfgca2z
Worth remembering that Osborne slashed Annual Investment Allowance to £25k in 2010 claiming 95% of firms wouldn't be affected #Budget2014
Growth forecast to slow down in '15; debt to GDP ratio still rising-and still no mention of #CostofLiving crisis #CostofCameron #Budget2014
Osborne has to admit that borrowing is up and will keep going up. What happened to balancing the books by 2015? #CostofCameron
Eton mess in a right mess on the front bench as they scrap for seats just ahead of #PMQs

@NickyMorgan01 figs are out of date & don't take a/c of recent Coalition changes. Time to stop squabbling over definitions & take action!
Lots of people asking about Care Bill. I'll be backing Lab amendment to delete #hospitalclosureclause & then will back NC16.
Danny A all over the place on child poverty -favours current measurement but also supports unspecified additional measurements #lookbothways
Osborne & Alexander have given a £3billion tax cut to the top 1% of earners - 85% of whom are men.
Osborne hasn't appointed a single woman to Bank of England Monetary Policy Ctte since 2010 - 1st time there hasn't been a woman since 1997
Reforming public services means devolving power to people
http://t.co/DsqDmG3yLq from @leicesterliz #onenationpolitics
Cameron's marriage tax allowance will benefit just 1/3 married couples & only 1/6 families with children - 84% of beneficiaries are men!
Coalition's 3-year Child Benefit freeze took £1.26billion from women & £26million from men.
Reductions in childcare support through tax credits under Osborne saw women lose £343m & men £47m.
IFS says 'tax and benefit reforms introduced since April 2010 can account for almost all of the increases in child poverty...'
Chancellor's tax & benefit changes since 2010 have raised £3.047bn (21%) from men & £11.628bn (79%) from women.
Treasury Q's in the Commons today - Osborne can't avoid the truth that his policies have hit women the hardest: http://t.co/x04Bxqjrwv

@NickyMorgan01 States child poverty falling. IFS estimates there will be 1million more children in poverty in 2020 than in 2010

Congratulations to our new Scottish Cabinet & thanks to @forlean & @KennyMacAskill for all their hard work & service. http://t.co/aN0Sjau7pP
Brilliant speech by @MorayMP on maximum powers for Scotland
Delighted for @NicolaSturgeon and pleased she will be First Minister for all of Scotland.
@garydunion you are right. The #indyref was an exercise in self determination. It was not "divisive" it was democracy in action.
@AlexSalmond brilliant resignation speech.   Labour... misjudged, bitter, tumbleweed.  #VoteSNP
So after the excitment of @theSNP conference, it's back to London tomorrow for a full week in Westminster
Thanks to everyone for their kind words  during @theSNP conference. It really does mean a great deal. #VoteSNP
@skagirl67 thanks - we'll all find out by 10 tomorrow - so excited!
@stewart_coco because I have the right experience - ex National Secretary, National Organiser. 31 yrs member of @theSNP.and 9 yrs an MP!

@Marc_Winsland also - I hope your not sending nasty tweets to me in YOUR work time?
@Marc_Winsland in for the start of the debate - then BBC interview - catching up on constituency work now - working for my constituents!
@Chris_Sibbald not good enough. Neither Clegg nor Farage will be PM No reason to exclude @theSNP. Debates will be broadcast in Scotland.
@SkyNews clearly some mistake here - the @theSNP is the 3rd biggest party in the UK. They must be included in all of these debates. #voteSNP

If any kind soul would like to donate to my @theSNP depute Leader campaign. Please click on donate button at http://t.co/26qRJX0aG4 thanks.
I'm delighted to announce that @theSNP members from more than 100 branches have nominated me as candidate for Depute Leader. Thanks to all.
@LachieMor1 Lachie, the @theSNP membership has gone from 25,000 to 75,000 since the #indyref.  It has indeed trebled!
Many people who voted no in the #indyref did so to get substantial new powers for Scotland - not to be taken for fools by a "petition" scam.
@PeteWishart Instead of a "petition" let's just elect a record number of Independence supporting MPs from Scotland next year!
Fantastic performance by @GlasgowMSP on #scotnight tonight. Very we'll done.
@Southsidegrrrl The Yes movement was deep and broad - if we are to keep it together it must continue to include everyone.
Delighted to be endorsed by @TonyBanks61 & @allangrogan founders of @BizforScotland & @labourforindy for my @theSNP Depute bid. Many thanks.
@jowall84 Returning the largest number of Indy MPs is to hold Westminster's "feet to the fire" so they deliver real maximum devolution.
I have emailed @theSNP Cllrs, MPs, MSPs and MEPs today. Full message is on FB page Stewart-Hosie-SNP. Please feel free to share widely.
@penguinos99 Very keen to see more @theSNP women candidates. Would support any pratical steps to deliver that and seek agreement in party.
@MatthewWils I want the broader Yes movement kept as dynamic and organic. Party structures are for @theSNP only. worked v well in #indyref

@andrewpercy indeed - and thank goodness for that.  Always trust the Scottish people.

@faisalislam There is no single devo offer - 3 different versions and none of them remotely devo-max. Only a Yes vote can deliver powers.
Let's be clear there are NO new powers with a no vote. Only the rubbish plans already announced. Don't get fooled again. #VoteYes

@andrewpicken1 indeed. But ICM poll does show only a 2 point gap.  All to play for and momentum IS with @YesScotland
@andrewpicken1 not sure you're right about that. We saw tonight Salmond & @YesScotland have a vision - Darling & No Camp have a script.
Big, clear and decisive win for Alex Salmond and @YesScotland on #bbcindyref
Weak, weak closing from Darling. Losing votes with every stuttering word.
#bbcindyref Darling and the No Campaign are collapsing before our eyes. He doesn't actually know what he's talking about. #voteyes
#bbcindyref. Darling now defending the UK Tory Government. Tory cuts to the NHS are OK now then are they?  #voteyes
Darling dragging up the subsidy myth, now getting laughed at. #bbcindyref

@naebD which is what the Fiscal Commission Working Group did - and concluded Sterling was in both Scotland and rUK's best interest.
@DouglasDaniel it's a re-hash of the #ProjectFear "What currency will Scotland use" story.  The answer is Sterling - but they know that!
@Lee_Symes Indeed, but as the No camp continue to peddle discredited stories, the Scottish people have stopped listening to them. #voteyes

@ComeOnScotland Yes, but not in 140 chars! Key thing is they couldn't agree on devo-anything and were afraid to put it to the vote #VoteYes
@ComeOnScotland The No camp can't have it both ways - If there is a "shy" No vote then there is a "shy" Yes voe aswell. We will win this.
So with a sample size of 8,317 (don't knows excluded) it's 57.6% #VoteYes & 41.4% no. Great #masscanvass results. http://t.co/Tt5ckJVSy1
@SpectatorEvents But the economics of Scottish Independence do add up and make a huge amount of sense. #VoteYes
@ScottishPol An inkling like £200 million! As opposed to the UK's "spectacularly wrong information." Transitioning...Scottish State Page 5

@seanlondonandon No, I am happy to work for a safe route for us cyclists based on accurate data. Ignoring problems won't make them go away.
@seanlondonandon Well, if you are not a constituent, that's not my problem. Maybe you should have words with your own candidates.
@seanlondonandon I am not allowed to tell lies and thank you, I'm glad you think I am, very kind.
@RevenantCyclist @seanlondonandon @yourcanarywharf @tfl Everything I quoted is in the public domain.
@seanlondonandon I don't hide from my voters. I was cycling around Poplar today and met many. Everything I do/say on this is public.
@RevenantCyclist @seanlondonandon I've spent 2 weeks double checking my facts and everything I said can be verified with one qualification.
@seanlondonandon "My over to your part", what does that mean sir/madam?
@seanlondonandon If you're not a constituent, I have no duty to respond to you in the same way as I have to the 2 constituents who e mailed.

After 5 and a half hours trying to get called in the debate on recognition of Palestine, it looks like we'll run out of time. Too many b4 me
When 5 Tory grandees all say they're supporting recognition for Palestine and joining Lab and Lib-Dems in the lobby the motion should pass.
Strong support in the Chamber to recognise Palestine. I'm in little doubt the motion will pass but will the Government listen and act?

@spitzbullets I think in real English that should be too little too late. But hey, grammar, spelling, FACTS....not really important to some.
@spitzbullets Funny, in the Commons only an hour ago I quoted from his speech to our National Policy Forum in Milton Keynes.See,facts again
@spitzbullets So that's a "no" then. You have no idea, have you? You have a view based on no facts and won't even look. That says it all!
@spitzbullets So you didn't hear my question to the PM yesterday, didn't read my question the FCO, and won't let facts spoil your smear?

@annispice Maybe they thought it was dreadful but not a matter of overwhelming power against a vastly inferior force. And that' s no excuse.
@annispice What nonsense. Most of my constituency is white, and there are good and bad people in every community.

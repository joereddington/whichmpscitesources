@emjaykays status is not the same as terms and conditions - I was saying be free but get the equal respect you deserve....
@Colin_Lawson I favour maximising benefits for those who need it most. Child of well off  have means to eat well
@tobykier is that why some receive child benefit and others none at all!...where is the consistency?
Giving »400pa to millionaire parents of 4-6 yr olds...my values say target resources to poorest.
Delighted to hear that Gary Streeter is standing for Deputy Speakership....he gets my vote!
@tobykier yes of course but it shouldn't not apply justice just because he was a 'celebrity' or cabinet minister!
Huhne:'CPS loves a celebrity trial': surely CPS just wanted a lying Cabinet minister to face justice?
Proud to see apprentices graduate at Qinetiq, Boscombe.

@Colin_Lawson If TPA are 'biased' - the Guardian Datablog shows the scale of increase in govt spending just as well! http://t.co/h92QXhvejG
@Colin_Lawson You seem reluctant to share this graph with your readership http://t.co/y4AC7rl93w - UK govt spending easily outstrips OECD
Just asked q to support Helen Holgate a brilliant local foster carer - concurrency process needs speeding up for good of all involved
@GSGOV strange 'basic economics' to believe additional borrowing does not impact interest rate levels. Debts need to be paid not extended.
Balls confirms he is prepared to borrow even more and interest rates will rise if he does...
@Colin_Lawson...until Labour accept relative overspend and blame banks alone, who they were responsible for regulating, they won't be heard
@Colin_excessive spending left debts beyond where bank failures alone would have left us. Try reviewing govt spending 02-10 as % of GDPvsG20
@Colin_Lawson .systemic overspending and the failure of Brown to regulate in the belief that he had ended 'boom and bust' is the real cause
@Colin_Lawson and if we followed Balls and borrowed even more - interest rates would rise...and who created the debts in the first place?
Chuka won't tell us what happens to mortgage rates in the short term...they go up if you borrow more.

@naomiandjack @sbrine Very positive meeting with PM and Naomi House re funding for children's hospices
@oflynnexpress The proposal is to replace it with endowment income - not cut it altogether
@oflynnexpress Sorry not to give you a shock story - but please report the actual contents of the paper rather than speculation about fees!
@oflynnexpress The idea is different caps by subject group- not by uni - as I say it would depend on further research & econ circumstances
@oflynnexpress No, I expressly say: "it is reasonable to maintain a cap on tuition fees over the life of a course"(p14)!
@oflynnexpress The idea is different caps per subject group- I don't specify a cap - will depend on research & econ circumstances -see p18
@oflynnexpress What I mean by financial independence is clearly explained in pp10-12!
@oflynnexpress I.e., enable universities to cover costs with endowment income rather than grants as the full paper explains
@dukkhaboy @oflynnexpress No - should be based on economic cost - but valuable high cost subjects will often have highest earnings potential
@dukkhaboy @oflynnexpress If that is the case need to tackle by making clear high earnings potential - not by pre-emptive subsidy
@dukkhaboy @oflynnexpress HEFCE figures on subject course costs suggest it is v widespread - read my full FEG paper- http://t.co/NKyvMSvS
@dukkhaboy @oflynnexpress What about students studying arts subjects costing £6k but paying £9k to cross-subsidise others?
@dukkhaboy @oflynnexpress No - govt offers full fee loans & graduating medics have v high earnings potential in short period
@oflynnexpress My FEG paper doesn't recommend removing the fee cap - it recommends reforming it. Unis face perverse incentives & x-subsidy
@oflynnexpress My FEG report doesn't recommend removing the fee cap - just reforming it to save students money on living costs
Cameron the statesman triumphant vs Miliband the schoolboy sucking on his polos.....

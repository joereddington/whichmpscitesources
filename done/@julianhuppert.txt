@julianhuppert
@messageismyname thanks!
@PaulbernalUK @tom_watson gut reaction, no. But I could be wrong. Problem with this was it touched on a very raw nerve for labour
@brett4cambridge I proposed a ban on extortionate letting fees in my Private Member's Bill see eg http://t.co/5mWKxFN7lQ
@PaulbernalUK @tom_watson I'm always surprised how many MPs don't tweet for themselves; seems very risky to me
@PaulbernalUK @tom_watson it was an interesting post. There is a need to think before you tweet, speak, or anything else!
@sideshow_jim great - thanks!
@Ruralhalfwit @ThomasPride but there was a higher turnout from labour than government
@Ruralhalfwit @ThomasPride I don't think that's today. I was there for almost the whole time, and I can't see others who were there.
@Ruralhalfwit thanks to you too!
@borngeek thanks!
@caronmlindsay @neilfawcett @Kav_Kaushik @JoshDixonTweets @CandyPiercy congrats to all ...
@swhitebread @BelindaBG @zoeimogen yes indeed!
@hobbs_samantha @sus22 excellent!
@wildfoodie1 @DanielZeichner @AndrewLansley I was there and voted for it ... as for where I was during the vote, probably voting!
@CameronBroome97 and did they manage? thanks anyway
@fenlandgrimpeur @Velocentric @DavidMcleanCycl apologies ...
@CameronBroome97 oh? tell me more ...
@alyzande thanks!
At my constituency surgery in the City Centre #fb
All this is on top of the government's proposals for recalling MPs. Please ask your MP to support them! and wish me luck ... #fb
I want to allow public to recall for misconduct for recall even if no conviction; court would check there's a prima facie case to answer #fb
I want to allow recall for anyone convicted of misconduct in public office, or expenses fraud, as well as any jailed for other offences #fb
Monday will be an interesting day for me -I have lots of amendments to the Recall Bill to make it stronger. Ask your MP to support them! #fb
@314PAC thanks and hi!
Now voting to end debate so this bill can pass, even though it means giving up my chance to speak ... #fb
Still hoping to speak in this debate ... Noteworthy that almost no one from any side has yet mentioned mental health ...
For anyone following this NHS debate, if debate doesn't finish by 2:30, the Bill falls. So there will probably be a closure motion soon #fb
@Skylarksara *waves*
@polkadotlemon I proposed an amendment to achieve that, but got too little support - no Labour MP signed it
Shame both last government and this one got it wrong on this
Good point made about Labour's record - they paid private providers more than NHS to do operations, & paid for operations that didn't happen
There's 10 more bills to be debated today, in theory, including one I'm co-sponsoring. Each debate has to finish by 2:30 to pass :( #fb
@polkadotlemon I voted against & campaigned against fees when Labour introduced them, when they tripled them, & when this gov't tripled them
@HereBeSin yep, I know
@HereBeSin and colour matters too
@SmallAperture thanks!
@Jontybark Andy can deny it all he likes ... But see http://t.co/U5MRQIZYGM or http://t.co/rMVeVE6i7R
@38_degrees see http://t.co/6L74xC9XDc for more details. Or http://t.co/B39418KoJH
@HereBeSin placebo is fascinating, and there has been lots of research
@Privateallergy I voted against it
@HereBeSin that's a fast transcription of his speech!
Tredinnick calling for a move away from evidence based medicine. I kid you not. I finally gave in after 15 minutes and challenged him #fb
@DavidMcleanCycl @Velocentric @allpartycycling :) thanks and *waves*
@benosteen :) thanks
Now we have David Tredinnick ... Just the man you want speaking about healthcare ... #fb
@benosteen thanks ... I do find the bickering detracts from having a productive discussion. Why I highlighted John Pugh's speech too
This figure is still going up, at a similar rate ... I have huge concerns whichever government gets the NHS wrong! #fb
In 1997/8 NHS bought in £1.1 billion of medical services, by 2009/10, up to £7.5 billion. Massive increase in privatisation under Labour #fb
Very thoughtful speech on NHS Bill from John Pugh. I pushed our approach to allow local integrated health bodies http://t.co/1UCdvsS1jG #fb
@dtb200 oh I wish ... But yes, makes it easier for private members bills to be stopped. Lots of other things do that too
@turquog81 the main issue is getting to a vote - I think we'll have to move to end the debate or it'll be talked out.
@doc_ros Hi Ros, I'm there and will vote for the bill. Hope all is well and you're looking forward to the move to Cambridge!
There are no time limits on speeches on private member's bills, so people try to talk them out. Now onto the 32nd minute of this speech #fb
Interesting to have quotes read out from Labour Health Secretary Alan Milburn calling for more private provision in NHS - which they did #fb
@pedbad I'm in the Chamber and will vote for it
@turquog81 I'm here and will be voting for the bill
@MLBrook amen to that ...
@MnWthtQualities I voted against the Health & Social Care Bill, and against fees - unlike when Cambridge had a Labour MP; she voted for them
I'm hoping to speak in the NHS debate; briefly, to avoid talking it out, but fear I won't get a chance. No speech time limits on Fridays #fb
@PPLvsPFI ah well. It seemed unlikely.
Interesting to finally hear acceptance from Labour backbenchers their gov't got PFI & privatisation wrong. Will their frontbench listen?
@MLBrook me too ...
@kimmiemoonkit there's no requirement to attend prayers, although there's no way to guarantee a seat otherwise
@MLBrook sad thing is that the Labour record on this isn't good, and this government's record also isn't good. Hence the silliness
@Gerrycambridge I'm here and will vote for it
@RadWagon @EhUpTim indeed. I'm not saying I agree with that.
Now we start the NHS Bill debate. Credit to Clive Efford for bringing it, and admitting that Labour 'unlocked ... http://t.co/5Sjahs30bD
Interesting spat between UKIP MPs and the Labour awkward squad on who gets to sit in their preferred seats ... #fb
And prayers are because every day in Parliament starts with prayers. Because it does.
This vote to sit in private is part of Parliamentary silliness. Happens every sitting Friday just after 9:30, & always defeated. Time waste
First up today in HoC (after prayers) is Mark Reckless taking his oath. Then a motion from Clive Efford that the house sit in private #fb
@RTaylorUK my lifelong ambition ... ;)
It's worth remembering what Labour did to the health economy in Cambs with PFIs and Hinchingbrooke privatisation http://t.co/6L74xC9XDc #fb
Labour massively increased private sector role in the NHS - from 1bn/year to 7.5 bn/ year. Both they and Lansley got it wrong & did harm #fb
On my way to Westminster to vote for today's NHS Bill. I voted against Lansley's Health & Social Care Bill, and this is a step forwards. #fb
@vorno on my way there to vote for it now!
@SandieBlickem I'll be voting for the Bill
@King_Fortnox and thanks!
@King_Fortnox TTIP will overall have substantial benefits ... There's a lot of scaremongering going on though! Full details will be voted on
@propensity @GregMulholland1 thanks!
@kilian_bourke @CambsCC @CambsPboroCCG very alarming!
The Times comment on our fantastic win to save pubs. #fairdeal4yourlocal #fb @gregmulholland1 http://t.co/t0Lv6Cd7qq
Nice cartoon in the Times nicely captures how the Tory and Labour race to sound like UKIP simply helps UKIP #fb http://t.co/0V9c5szqCk
@PaulbernalUK agreed on both counts
@dtb200 good to hear
@zeno001 @Atos exactly
@dominiccampbell I wasn't an MP then - and trying to get the Tories to undo measures Labour did badly like that is hard work!
@zeno001 @Atos I presume Labour hired them because they had already hired them to work on other assessments.
@PaulbernalUK Agreed. Welfare Reform Act 2007 was pretty poor
@dominiccampbell Agreed. Welfare Reform Act 2007 was pretty deficient
@zeno001 @Atos awful, isn't it
I'm so glad we've sacked ATOS from doing Work Capability Assessments. They're currently 580,000 behind! http://t.co/m8Bd6abRNJ #fb
Great to meet Cambridge firefighters yesterday. I'll keep pressing government for a fair deal on their pensions #fb http://t.co/XzuKBJbaIN
@binny_uk @bengoldacre ;)
@BeaumontBee actually, the figures are that Labour did more. And I did vote against the bill
@Calluphid @JanetAth @camcycle it's very good
@LisaForbes_ @BeaumontBee I opposed Lansley's Bill. Sadly, Labour privatised even more, especially in Cambridgeshire. http://t.co/6L74xC9XDc
Nice to get positive comments from BIS Minister Ed Vaizey for @scoutu's scale-up report http://t.co/IroLe8qhpA http://t.co/g89calQELo #fb
In Chamber for BIS Q's. I'll press for more support for Cambridge devolution, inward investment body, & Sherry Coutu's scale-up report #fb
@BeaumontBee @LisaForbes_ I'll be there and vote for it
@wildfoodie1 yes
@jonmbutterworth thanks!
@miss_s_b hmmmm
@SikhFedUK I hope to be able to get there!
@DaveB59 @cusuaccess ees were introduced by Labour in 1998. They were then tripled in 2004 by Labour & again in 2010, when I voted against
Tomorrow I'll press BIS on what they're doing to support Cambridge tech cluster; will press for more so we contribute more to UK economy #fb
@AdrianChaffey I speak out regularly against xenophobia. I don't tweet that same point every day. And I wish BBC etc ran our quotes more
@AdrianChaffey ??? I've spoken out against their xenophobic policies on many occasions
More odd scenes in Parliament today. Labour have opposition day debate & tabled motion to endorse Gov't policy on EU Justice cooperation #fb
Great article in the @Independent about our win for pubs yesterday http://t.co/vFKzxpRHNR - gives credit correctly! #fb #fairdeal4yourlocal
@cusuaccess wish I could be there; I was involved in protests when Labour introduced fees, when I was a student!
@JackO_May @TCSNewspaper see http://t.co/fOq6ig5QGo
@Article1UK thanks
@JackO_May @TCSNewspaper nope!
@_Hugh_Chapman sadly not
What a contrast - we've called for £1.5 billion extra for the NHS, Labour have said they would delay giving it more money. #fb
@geoffjones it's not in anyway, but if you mean Friday's bill , I'm voting for it
Now preparing to speak in a debate about why we should allow votes at 16. #fb
@LukeTheWarner it's already over £10 billion; haven't checked recently, Labour's figs for bonus tax were higher than bonuses paid one year!
@LukeTheWarner I voted in favour of dropping the bill. Twice
@ChrisRandWrites thanks!
My comments earlier today about the pubs vote - delighted we won it! http://t.co/ty8CpN4QGA #fb #fairdeal4yourlocal
@LukeTheWarner very wise
@Pitonman @CAMRA_Official it will be published tomorrow on the publicwhip hansard and theyworkforyou websites
@LukeTheWarner that's not a vote on the NHS Bill. Try http://t.co/9JLWF6ngs8 - and I prefer a bank levy, which raises more money from banks
@LukeTheWarner I hate to bring facts into it, but you know I voted against the NHS reforms and for the bank levy, which Labour opposed ;)
@Rolo_Tamasi @caronmlindsay @GregMulholland1 er, no.
@LukeTheWarner I'll make sure you only get the quality literature ...
@solidus I'm already planning to be there and vote for the Bill; I voted against Lansley's Health and Social Care Act too.
@JK1440 good plan
@JK1440 that's why I've been fighting to fix it. Awful story
@_edouglas thanks!
@JK1440 I'm sorry to hear it. What happened?
Still overjoyed by the success of our amendment to provide a #fairdeal4yourlocal ... This will make a huge difference to many pubs! #fb
Fantastic! We won 284-269 #fairdeal4yourlocal #fb
Now off to #voteforpubs #fairdeal4yourlocal
Now @CommonsHomeAffs we have the Immigration Minister, and the Directors General of UK Visas & Immigration, and Immigration Enforcement #fb

@HereBeSin we haven;t discussed it yet

At @commonsBBcom to support application for debate on Small Business Saturday, & one on availability and pricing of branded drugs in NHS #fb
@andrewwr235 franchise should not be linked to an exam
Great to get clear support from Nick Clegg in the Chamber for the principle of greater devolution of powers to Greater Cambridge #fb
@HereBeSin good
@HereBeSin groan. You've complained?
It's good to hear Labour speaking out in favour of votes at 16. Shame they opposed it when they were in government, but glad they changed
@JackO_May @TCSNewspaper nice article ...
@jeremybradley splitters! ;)
@jeremybradley and South Cambs

@longshotkick fair enough. I hope you enjoy the campaign
@longshotkick how come? For who?
@BeaumontBee @IanMearnsMP @WOWpetition the bill hasn't been published anywhere I can see, so while I probably support it, can't be sure yet
@EurVoice @mahelamike need to ensure good quality rail service at affordable price. Public sector should be able to bid, but not only them
@EurVoice We should have an in-out referendum when there is a substantial transfer of power to the EU; as we've already ensure in the EU Act
@KieranMcCrory @EurVoice I don't see how you could have part of the country in the EU and other parts not in
@waveringradient @EurVoice I voted to recognise the State of Palestine, and the government should follow through with that
@waveringradient @EurVoice We should be standing firm against illegal settlements, and hold Israel to the same standards as everywhere else
@EurVoice I think both UKIP and Greens should be in one debate - very perverse to have UKIP but not the Greens, as currently proposed.
@KieranMcCrory @EurVoice I very much hope that as and when there is a referendum, the public across the UK will chose to stay in the EU
@EurVoice it is surely offensive in a modern democracy to have an appointed/inherited like House of Lords. It should be elected regionally
@EurVoice We benefit massively from our membership of EU, but haven't let people know the facts. It shouldn't be EU who do the marketing!
@CCLeicsPolice @MentalHealthCop ... as ever ...
@conniptions glad you enjoyed it!
@selfregulate thanks and agreed
@Marthalanefox sure - when would suit? I'll email you
@RTaylorUK @Puffles2010 ... With rather remarkable claim that losing a seat, and only getting 1.2% more votes than May, is 'strong increase'
@CherryHintonBlu he has done. But didn't today. http://t.co/4iBJm3otE5
@williamheath @ClaudeMoraesMEP @natalieben well chaired, and good to  see so much agreement. Now we just need to get everyone else on board!
@CherryHintonBlu http://t.co/6CkUqe745I
@Aurum_Boss it's a great example of the discriminatory problems of this sort of filtering
@Jimjar thanks! Do get involved in campaigning!
@smithsam @doctorow sadly not
Great to speak on panel at #ORGcon14 about Digital Rights; honoured to be described by @doctorow as 'a principled politician' #fb
@Jimjar @williamheath nice
@TimWardCam yes indeed.
Amused Cambridge Labour try to portray losing a council seat to us as a good result - esp given they got Miliband Harmann etc to help #fb
@amerimatryoshka @Antsmall @scott_moores not the best answer though ...
On my way to #ORGcon14 - see you all there! @orgNewsUpdates #fb
@MusicianByNight wow - who remembers that? It was ages back, and a lot of fun! And no - I'm kinda busy now ...
@MusicianByNight I don't think I ever played any of his work as a percussionist ... But I might be misremembering
@MusicianByNight I'm a huge fan ... You?
Interesting chat with @webrootsUK about online voting. They suggest it is secure enough and would boost turnout & engagement. Thoughts? #fb
Now at @CambsCC to discuss the desperately needed infrastructure improvements for transport around Cambridge - and more! #fb

@cosmicflame I think I can't, but will check the diary
@AliceBThomas interested, yes. Able to go? Probably not. What time?
@claireOT @rosiehospital this sounds absolutely awful; I'm so sorry you've all had to go through this. Have you had any reaction from Rosie?

Lastly at @CommonsHomeAffs we have Policing Minister Mike Penning to discuss policing and mental health #fb
Now @CommonsHomeAffs we have Norman Lamb, Minister for Health, to discuss policing and mental health #fb
@ianeiloart @miss_s_b @alantravis40 @TheHowardLeague someone else did - prison staff
@PaulbernalUK exactly
@PaulbernalUK NP. Seems like genuine cockup - raises concerns for me about other errors
@LibertyMark thanks!
@PaulbernalUK @commonshomeaffs not sure it's an issue for him. We covered it in the Chamber earlier
Now back in @CommonsHomeAffs to hear from Met Commissioner about RIPA, then Norman Lamb & Mike Penning about mental health & policing #fb
@miss_s_b @TheHowardLeague lots of good reasons!
@miss_s_b @alantravis40 @TheHowardLeague Jack Straw even had calls to his office recorded when he was Lord Chancellor ...
@miss_s_b @alantravis40 @TheHowardLeague this one isn't his fault. Happened since 2006 at least, without ministers knowing
@Iain_33 ;)
@HereBeSin not that I can think of, but maybe
@HereBeSin home MP, ie Norwich in that case
Turns out prison staff recorded and listened to some calls from prisoners to their MP. Certainly going since 2006.
We're about to move on to a statement on prison communications #fb
@Iain_33 and interesting that she didn't dispute her track record in delaying reports ...
@HereBeSin even worse then. I saw some good practice when I went to Peterborough prison, which seemed to be working well
@miss_s_b indeed on both!
Awful figures on self-harm in women's prisons. 6k attempts a year, from 10k before 2010. Shockingly bad; more MH support being provided #fb
Nice question from @timfarron on the ECHR; made the case well for it. Grayling accepted Government policy is to stay in the ECHR #fb
Nice cross-party work in Justice questions; Nia Griffith (Lab), Crispin Blunt (Con) & I all pressed for humanist weddings to be allowed #fb
Now hearing from Wanless and Whittam about their review into the missing Home Office files on child abuse allegations #fb

Now at @CommonsHomeAffs hearing evidence on historic child abuse. First witnesses are Alison Millar, Peter Saunders & Hilary Willmer #fb
@alantravis40 ;)
@alantravis40 wll e've -> we'll have
@alantravis40 I think wll e've to rearrange. Seems odd to have to choose between questioning Wanless & Home Sec on same issue at same time!
Busy day! @CommonsHomeAffs 11-1 & 2:30-5, urgent Q on Wanless review 1-2, statement on 'prison communications' 2-3, & a Justice Q at 1 #fb

@jossgarman we've been very clear!
@neilmacehiter thanks!
@HereBeSin national right now, but will be doing casework later. Both are FT jobs ...
@HereBeSin lucky you. Actually, the debate finished early for odd reasons. But I'm still here working.
@RTaylorUK it's a good read ... Especially where the debate gets rewound
@eddwilson very low
@RTaylorUK correct. My error
After all the Parliamentary procedure, a massive vote in favour of the motion to opt in to some measures!
now voting on proposal that motion we're debating 'be not now put'. Last proposed by my predecessor David Howarth. Happy Birthday to him!
@5742Days done
@TweeterReynolds @NormanBakerMP @normanlamb there are many safeguards, as we've been reforming the system
@TweeterReynolds @NormanBakerMP @normanlamb because I don't want us to become a haven for criminals fleeing prosecution
@HereBeSin fairly normal ...
@HereBeSin 10 is normal on a monday
Now we start the actual debate ... until 10
@RTaylorUK the problem is whether the vote is on what motion says, or on an implication. Eg when there have been votes against adjournment
Although May and Grayling have made a complete mess up of this process ...
Very confused debate here in the Commons. Technically, we're debating whether to extend the next item from lasting 90 minutes, to until 10
@luketdclark problem with May and Grayling trying to be silly
@halfofatwin @RailfutureEA March-Wisbech rail reopening is much needed. I have pushed for it as well
@luketdclark well indeed

@cycleoptic @LibDems yes, and much more is needed
@Dr_Teacake already in the plans
I'm disappointed by Cameron's plans to spend even more money on building new roads if Tories win. We need spend on rail, buses, bikes #fb

@greentrac one useful thing would be a way of integrating amendments with the text, updating with selections etc

Very good turnout for the Presidential Hustings at the #EoELDconf. I'm backing Sal for President #fb
@WJBarter is that how the constitutional line of succession works?
At the East of England #ldconf. Great to catch up with so many people! #fb
At my Saturday morning constituency surgery #fb
@SteveBroach @PaulbernalUK @JusticeforLB and indeed CLG and DH
@SteveBroach @PaulbernalUK @JusticeforLB Seems reasonable at 1st glance, but haven't looked at details. Shall I write to DWP for comment?
Just finished my regular Friday evening constituency surgery - next one is tomorrow morning. #fb
@PeteSims1 will do @JHCO1
@RTaylorUK data centres rather than internet ...
@onmybiketoo @HomesforBritain yes indeed!
@JubalBarca I hadn't - it's disgraceful! I raised this before, see e.g. http://t.co/Exzb96aHil
@KariSperring I have already
6 months until the General Election. If you've been pleased with what I've done so far, please help me continue! http://t.co/6EKhbAG0ao #fb
@WillimRogers you'll have to ask around. Try St John Innovation Centre
@JK1440 @markpack great!
@WillimRogers not quite sure what you mean. Maybe Cambridge Consultants ?
@kilian_bourke um ... Thanks?
At Beehive Centre today, Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation have inflatable lungs to show harm from smoking #fb http://t.co/odG4IdmVsv
@StevieBenton @CIPR_CEO @MariamCook @gabehughes very interesting ...
@Dr_Teacake @allpartycycling @gallimaufrey777 yes indeed!
@carltonreid thanks - do come to Cambridge then! @camcycle
@HenryBatchelor1 Thanks!
Long and detailed meeting at @CUH_NHS - lots of issues to discuss. #fb
@SaveLifeworks sadly ...
And an early demonstration of the problems with Labour's decision to centralise planning, so it is less democratic. #fb
This was a bad decision; consequences will be felt by all those who use Mill Rd, whether they shop there, walk, cycle, take bus or drive #fb
Very disappointing result - the applications were approved. Worth noting that every Labour Cllr voted in favour. #fb
@TheIET yes
@HereBeSin @camcycle well exactly
@IMeche_Eastern yes - I agree with the list of actions and already implement them! #IETSkills
Lots of members of the public here at the @camcitco planning meeting. I'll be trying to stop yet another supermarket on Mill Road #fb
@RTaylorUK @DuncanStott I had one two weeks ago. Very unlikely to get another so soon
@skarloey @camcitco @MillRoadSociety it matters. Sorry you can't be there!
@elfasi @TheRealRevK The temporary DRIPA, maintained (and slightly reduced) powers, and secured full RIPA review, transparency reports etc
Let's hope we get the right result anyway!
People are already discovering harms caused by Labour's move to centralise planning, making it harder for the public to attend and speak #fb
Off to speak at the @camcitco Planning Committee to oppose an application that could cause problems for Mill Rd. @MillRoadSociety #fb
@CyberSecKent thanks!
@secretspartacus I've done my best ... we'll see. Should get an answer on 11th or so. You can see all my Q's & A's at http://t.co/vKqe2gJft2
@secretspartacus I won't get a better answer, but I'll see what I can do.
@camcycle wish I could be with you!
@secretspartacus I noticed too. Next DWP questions are not for a while ...
I think we can have both security and privacy - The Director of GCHQ is wrong. See http://t.co/vqUrVabNwU @commentisfree @guardian #fb
@timsykes3 it's a shame - he's been an excellent minister
.@BBCCambs that's fantastic and very well deserved!
Back in @CommonsHomeAffs to hear from Police officers about RIPA #fb
Now @CommonsHomeAffs we have the General Secretary of the National Union of Journalists to discuss the use of RIPA against journalists #fb
Now @CommonsHomeAffs where we are looking at RIPA. Hearing first from the acting interim Interception of Communications Commissioner #fb
@rpoolman agreed
Useful to talk to people from the #homesforbritain campaign - we need to build 300k homes/year! #fb http://t.co/88wwcLeyim
Great to meet Cambridge-based Ultra Electronic Controls, who do aerospace engineering. They moved to Cambridge to get good engineers #fb
@Puffles2010 @civiltalker I think we've met, actually ... but hi anyway!
@rpoolman soon, I hope. Trying to work up details now
Now catching up with @drsarahmain from @sciencecampaign #fb
@ianeiloart @UKParliament yes
Now meeting with the @EnergySvgTrust about how to save energy at home, business, and in the community #fb

@SamGPriddy rail fares are far too high. They used to go up above inflation every year; now with inflation. Need to come down in real terms! Thu Apr 16 09:05:58 BST 2015
@SamGPriddy also need to improve conditions for private rental, so we control letting agents & bad landlords, & provide longer tenancies Thu Apr 16 09:04:27 BST 2015
@SamGPriddy also lots of Council and social houses - we started a programme to build 2000 council homes when we ran the Council Thu Apr 16 09:03:20 BST 2015
@SamGPriddy housing is a key challenge for Cambridge as it grows. It is far too expensive! At heart, we have to build more houses here Thu Apr 16 09:02:56 BST 2015

@CharlesworthD @GNRailUK its a really complex system, and I agree the outcomes are often disappointing Thu Apr 16 09:00:03 BST 2015
@CharlesworthD a huge challenge - something I've worked hard for. Partly we need to ensure evidence is published more, and trials are done Thu Apr 16 08:59:17 BST 2015

@Amandycat we also need to get some more money in; we've committed to increasing the research budgets in particular Thu Apr 16 08:55:37 BST 2015
@Amandycat good luck! I think there is a need for policy stability, so that HE can get on with what it is supposed to do! Thu Apr 16 08:54:22 BST 2015
@nfgoudie we've pushed for much more devolution; it's been a long standing effort from us Thu Apr 16 08:51:56 BST 2015
@Amandycat *waves* Thu Apr 16 07:46:31 BST 2015

@Camb2Brighton no; but how better to get our message across? Tue Apr 14 18:48:27 BST 2015
@Camb2Brighton have you said yes yet? ;) Tue Apr 14 18:43:20 BST 2015
@GeraldineRyan me too ... Tue Apr 14 18:05:32 BST 2015
@ChrisTMarsden thanks! Tue Apr 14 18:04:52 BST 2015
@ChrisTMarsden party policy is explicitly pro net neutrality Tue Apr 14 17:58:32 BST 2015
Interesting to see the former Chair of Cambridge Conservatives and former Leader of @cambscc has defected to UKIP ... #fb Tue Apr 14 16:04:52 BST 2015
@manxboy will check up Tue Apr 14 15:31:31 BST 2015
Gloriously sunny day to be out doorknocking ... #fb http://t.co/xvTVT9osla Tue Apr 14 14:53:50 BST 2015
@tag_freeman I was asked for comment by varsity. I'm not allowed to reply? Tue Apr 14 14:31:00 BST 2015
@tag_freeman we weren't given the chance to! Tue Apr 14 14:20:23 BST 2015
@karohemd And new (rather better ones) being rebuilt Tue Apr 14 12:59:53 BST 2015
There are too many long term empty homes that could be brought back into use. Please RT/share if you agree @emptyhomes #NoMoreEmptyHomes #fb Tue Apr 14 12:49:53 BST 2015
Delighted to hear the Cambridgeshire Central Library/Kora decision being referred back to @CambsCC committee in June. Well done all! #fb Tue Apr 14 12:04:54 BST 2015
Great to meet with @macmillancancer this morning to discuss holistic cancer care. #fb http://t.co/dsqkAxzoqt Tue Apr 14 12:00:59 BST 2015
Now going to a Macmillan Cancer Support event, so have to leave @CambsCC library meeting. Will keep careful track though! #fb Tue Apr 14 10:58:19 BST 2015
@OliverMosley she suggested bracelets for people w mental health problems. I think it was a spur of the moment comment, not a planned policy Tue Apr 14 10:55:05 BST 2015
Lib Dem Maurice Leeke proposes referring library decision back to the committee after consultation. Labour's Paul Sales seconds it #fb Tue Apr 14 10:52:56 BST 2015
Lib Dem group leader Maurice Leeke asks why Kora were the only possible options considered and criticises lack of consultation Tue Apr 14 10:51:59 BST 2015
Now onto committee debate. Cllr @libdemed starting things off, highlighting failure of consultation. Similar problem with streetlighting #fb Tue Apr 14 10:49:18 BST 2015
Lib Dem Group Leader Cllr Leake says of course we should accept the petition. It doesn't mean the entire Council agrees every word of it Tue Apr 14 10:43:23 BST 2015
Tory Chair Steve Count annoyed that the petition wording wasn't in his briefing. Legal adviser hadn't seen it either. Tue Apr 14 10:42:37 BST 2015
Labour Cllr Paul Sales asking if the County can accept the petition given it suggests Kora are 'unethical' Tue Apr 14 10:40:38 BST 2015
Tory Cllr Bailey objecting to use of words 'unethical' and 'privatisation' in the petition Tue Apr 14 10:39:26 BST 2015
@rtrnicholl she certainly proposed people w mental health conditions could have bracelets. I don't think she said they would be compulsory Tue Apr 14 10:37:51 BST 2015
Sara Payne quite rightly points out there's a library services consultation running until 30th April - why did @CambsCC decide early? #fb Tue Apr 14 10:36:55 BST 2015
@rtrnicholl I don't recall the exact words. I think @RTaylorUK has a video Tue Apr 14 10:34:41 BST 2015
Sarah Payne now speaking to the petition of 3,456 signatures opposed to Kora deal at Cambridge Central Library #fb http://t.co/WvOtzZey0E Tue Apr 14 10:33:01 BST 2015
Cllr Scutt spoke and raised more concerns about Kora. Now local resident John Rainbird speaking about library #fb http://t.co/pvTmnx9QRc Tue Apr 14 10:30:31 BST 2015
Barbara Ashwood points out there were three options - should look at others and consult properly before making a decision. Tue Apr 14 10:25:42 BST 2015
@rtrnicholl now? Tue Apr 14 10:25:36 BST 2015
@rtrnicholl @VarsityUK have you got it now? Tue Apr 14 10:19:10 BST 2015
Lib Dem Cllr Barbara Ashwood now speaking. She worked for over 30 years at the Cambridge Central Library #fb http://t.co/EzGqjuVeD7 Tue Apr 14 10:18:18 BST 2015
@boggits @JonValeCN @LibralLady yes indeed. Tue Apr 14 10:17:20 BST 2015
.Cllr @Librallady pointing out the problems with the proposal, the lack of information and lack of consultation. #fb http://t.co/HOlpf9nl8Q Tue Apr 14 10:14:45 BST 2015
Cllr @librallady outlining why she called for review of library decision. Points out public & most Cllrs weren't told until last minute #fb Tue Apr 14 10:11:10 BST 2015
Chair of the @CambsCC General Purpose Committee tells members that they may not refer to the confidential papers in this discussion #fb Tue Apr 14 10:08:41 BST 2015
Several County Cllrs - mostly Lib Dems some Lab - have called for a decision review of @CambsCC decision to give library space to Kora #fb Tue Apr 14 10:05:56 BST 2015
Now at @CambsCC where I spent 8 years as a Cllr for the discussion about the Cambridge Central Library Cafe. http://t.co/I2Oni7fnO3 #fb Tue Apr 14 10:02:11 BST 2015
@HereBeSin indeed. Not a phrase I would have used Tue Apr 14 08:14:29 BST 2015
@CambridgeNewsUK yes! Tue Apr 14 08:00:46 BST 2015
Argh no! Really bad idea ... http://t.co/zCmz4lLBFy #fb Mon Apr 13 22:49:32 BST 2015
@timsykes3 @HereBeSin @RTaylorUK @whereis007 I think it was also a spur of the moment thing rather than a prepared policy Mon Apr 13 22:48:32 BST 2015
@timsykes3 @HereBeSin @RTaylorUK @whereis007 there are so many reasons it's a bad idea Mon Apr 13 22:46:39 BST 2015
@rtrnicholl @VarsityUK I've already sent a reply to my team, who passed it on to me. Let me know if you don't get it! Mon Apr 13 22:40:50 BST 2015
@HereBeSin @RTaylorUK @whereis007 it's what she said. Absolutely shocking idea. I suspect she'll realise it was silly soon, or already does Mon Apr 13 22:36:21 BST 2015
@LauraSparling um? Mon Apr 13 22:31:39 BST 2015
@timsykes3 happy birthday and thanks for asking about mental health! Mon Apr 13 22:27:41 BST 2015
@DrCJ_Houldcroft and thanks... Mon Apr 13 22:26:41 BST 2015
@DrCJ_Houldcroft oh? Where do you live? Email me on julian4cambridge at gmail and we can look into it Mon Apr 13 22:26:31 BST 2015
@karohemd shame ... You can help campaign though :) Mon Apr 13 22:25:12 BST 2015
Looking forward to tonight's hustings on the NHS. Why won't Labour spend the money the NHS itself says it needs? #fb Mon Apr 13 19:03:47 BST 2015
@kayaburgess pretty thin to me ... no actual commitments ... Mon Apr 13 13:40:50 BST 2015
OK - thanks for all the q's on #digitalrights - Please do respond to the consultation so we can get this spot on! http://t.co/edbLxFAD38 #fb Mon Apr 13 13:33:08 BST 2015
@richietynan @josephfcox @mjrharris @e3i5 @CasparBowden See point 7 2 Mon Apr 13 13:32:12 BST 2015
@PoliticsScot Please do - there's a lot more in there! Mon Apr 13 13:31:46 BST 2015
On #digitalrights, worth looking to see what Labour & Tories say. Lab manifesto v weak on this. Tories will probably push Snooper's Charter Mon Apr 13 13:31:24 BST 2015
@graphiclunarkid Great thanks! Mon Apr 13 13:30:32 BST 2015
@PoliticsScot Have you read the whole document? There's much more than just DPA Mon Apr 13 13:29:21 BST 2015
@richietynan @josephfcox @mjrharris @e3i5 @CasparBowdeno distinguish it from suspicion driven work. Legislative language will be detailed! Mon Apr 13 13:28:24 BST 2015
@NetworkString The purpose of this is specifically to set a long-lasting framework of principles, to inform any future legislation Mon Apr 13 13:27:30 BST 2015
@graphiclunarkid You pessimist! We'll seek to achieve as much as we can, and this is important. But it does depend what others will agree to Mon Apr 13 13:26:44 BST 2015
@JohnEDunn Some in the other parties do get it, and would be very much onside with this. Mon Apr 13 13:25:51 BST 2015
@JohnEDunn The other parties definitely don't take this seriously. See e.g. Labour's ID cards, Tory's pushing for the 'Snooper's Charter' Mon Apr 13 13:25:36 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 There are definitely some individuals in other parties that would be supportive - and with us pushing that may be enough Mon Apr 13 13:24:01 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 I think they mostly don't care about digital rights and privacy, and do damaging things without really thinking. Mon Apr 13 13:23:26 BST 2015
@NetworkString See point 10 - there should not be automatic or default filtering of legal content! and on surveillance, see point 7 Mon Apr 13 13:21:53 BST 2015
@Pippa_King indeed! Mon Apr 13 13:20:35 BST 2015
@ladylaxton @womensaid Happy to chat further - I agree there's a distinction between known and unknown abusers Mon Apr 13 13:20:14 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 If we get agreement in principle to do this in Government, there would be more work to fine tune it Mon Apr 13 13:19:35 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 We have put out two consultations, and discussed with various groups already. Please do respond to this round! Mon Apr 13 13:19:07 BST 2015
@Pippa_King yes indeed - see point 3 Mon Apr 13 13:16:25 BST 2015
@JohnEDunn awareness is definitely very low. Worth noting this covers a lot more breadth than DPR Mon Apr 13 13:15:46 BST 2015
@JohnEDunn Yes. When and if ... Mon Apr 13 13:15:04 BST 2015
@mjrharris @josephfcox @e3i5 @CasparBowden indeed we will! Mon Apr 13 13:14:44 BST 2015
@NiBeyls from last year? We need to change culture of surveillance so it is targeted, not blanket. More hay doesn't help find needles Mon Apr 13 13:13:41 BST 2015
@JohnEDunn to be honest, I think it may fall apart, because it tries to do too many things that aim in different directions Mon Apr 13 13:12:06 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 indeed - see section 13 bullet 2. Funding as well as powers Mon Apr 13 13:11:21 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 It sets principles for UK. EU DPR will of course have an impact, this would tie in - not clear what will DPR will finally be Mon Apr 13 13:10:53 BST 2015
@ladylaxton There's a huge amount we need to do to tackle DV, from education to refuges to police taking it seriously etc Mon Apr 13 13:09:33 BST 2015
@mjrharris @josephfcox @e3i5 @CasparBowden Thanks - and yes; the DBR will be in our manifesto. It's something we care a lot about! Mon Apr 13 13:08:26 BST 2015
@ladylaxton We hadn't specifically included DV survivors - online abuse is a problem for many people Mon Apr 13 13:08:03 BST 2015
@ChrisRandWrites We also need more technologically aware MPs - there are a few across the parties, but we are a very small band Mon Apr 13 13:07:06 BST 2015
@ChrisRandWrites but the world is changing around us, and Parliament simply cannot continue to sit so far behind what is happening! Mon Apr 13 13:06:43 BST 2015
@ChrisRandWrites This is a serious challenge! I don't think it will be easy to get this done, and there's no sign the other parties want to Mon Apr 13 13:06:15 BST 2015
@ZachThornton5 the power to proactively audit bodies is very important; key is to allow serious sanctions for DPA breach. fines are trivial Mon Apr 13 13:05:23 BST 2015
Important also to highlight that we are very keen for suggested improvements to our proposals; we want to get this right! #digitalrights #fb Mon Apr 13 13:03:53 BST 2015
@josephfcox @mjrharris @e3i5 @CasparBowden Indeed you don't - and they shouldn't automatically access your comms! Mon Apr 13 13:02:31 BST 2015

@MarkReckless responded to me saying he’d #backthebill but hasn’t said when he stopped supporting NHS privatisation #UkipNHSlies
#UkipNHSlies @UKIP have changed policy from supporting NHS privatisation because they know it could lose them the #Rochester by-election
When @MarkReckless @DouglasCarswell @Nigel_Farage did you change your views on privatisation of the NHS and decide to #backthebill?
@Nigel_Farage & his @UKIP make up policy as they go whenever asked to explain detail they say we've changed policy but no one can say when
.@BBCNews @BBCr4today Where’s the record of @Ukip conference decision rejecting @Nigel_Farage’s privatised insurance based NHS?

@ATNew So energy companies and developers should be left to rip off consumers and Gov't shouldn't stand up for ordinary people?
@ATNew Never heard of Baring's in 1995 or BCCI in 1991? selective memory?
@ATNew Is that right? So Help to Buy pouring petrol on already expanding housing bubble forcing prices up isn’t state intervention? Nonsense
.@bbcqt Tories are trying to portray standing up for consumers on cost of living, energy bills, house prices etc...as Marxist. What rubbish!
Yvette Cooper demonstrated her contempt for Quentin Letts pathetic attempts to bait her by completely ignoring them. Must have irritated him
.@bbcqt developers sitting on land artificially pushes up prices making housing unaffordable for young people. Build on it or lose it.

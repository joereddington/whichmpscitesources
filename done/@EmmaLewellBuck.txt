@KerryMP @CharlieBlags Hi Kerry big thank you for trying...hope it's  worked
Yesterday I called on Ministers to close employment loopholes which are costing workers hundreds of pounds. http://t.co/C3PwulS4n1
@m_s_quinn My pleasure, good to see you both Emma
In the Commons now for Urgent Question on Rotherham abuse.
Govt in denial about false self-employment. Workers losing thousands of pounds but no promise of action when I raised in Parl't just now.
Challenged Govt yesterday over growing no. of working people on housing benefit because wages no longer cover rent. http://t.co/dHdSASZM2U
Asked Q on Housing Benefit. Low pay means 2/3 more working people claiming. Wages too low to live on but Sec of State ignores in his reply.

@MAMAAUK I certainly don't think it should be or is an excuse

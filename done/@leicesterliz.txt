@Ermintrude2 @mangan_sonia thats what i'm saying - i champion cause whether or not its raised in emails/letters bcos its so important
@Ermintrude2 @mangan_sonia thats not true. I talk to people across the country, in every region, on doorstep, in community & voluntary orgs
@Ermintrude2 @mangan_sonia actually i receive very few emails/letters on care compared to other issues yet I still champion the cause

@savagandrew dont agree. Just as easy to write wrong thing in person as online. Problem is GP surgeries need to move with the times...
@nhsnurse1 same as if you have to register with GP in person: NHS number, utility/council tax bill - why can't people email these?
@savagandrew its unacceptable because people are at work! Should be able to at least register online
@Toryhealth and gave primary care to national @NHSEngland - too remove to know what's going on locally
@Toryhealth plus u removed incentives for extended opening hours
@Toryhealth point is its 21st century patients should be able to email or register online
@bushbytiger why can't patients register online?
Unbelievable - & unacceptable - that some GP surgeries only accept patient registrations in person, during working hours.

Vince Cable has proved himself a classic LibDem: criticises every1 else but when he's actually responsible, a total disaster #RoyalMail
Vince Cable's reputation goes from economic soothsayer to bargain basement salesman as flogs Royal Mail off on cheap.
Only just seen this: our excellent PPC for Lincoln @LucyRigby on sexist tweet from Tory Cllr @rgdavies @C4Politics http://t.co/mBxMlhXBfv

People want choice about how to use their savings - here's how to make pension reforms work for all http://t.co/tj8zMwXd6j @RachelReevesMP
@ChukaUmunna absolutely right on #marr: must tackle low skill, low wage economy & make strong case for staying in Europe. Tories do neither.
@dwilliamsHSJ yes definitely - got several cases, delayed/poor responses when concerns raised, worried no-1 taking responsibility.
@RoyLilley @HPIAndyCowper what a dreadful waste of time, £ and effort this awful NHS reorganisation had been...
@RoyLilley @HPIAndyCowper no-one is responsible...full stop
@SueThistle its GEM I'm worried about, 2 terrible local cases. Can you email your experience? liz.kendall.mp@parliament.uk
Thanks for advice on whose resp at @NHSEngland for Commissioning Support Units - v unhappy w quality of NHS Continuing Care commissioning
Urgent question for NHS tweeps - who at @NHSEngland is responsible for Commissioning Support Units??

Packed mass at St Patricks, globe placed at altar to symbolise our diverse city & our responsibilities to those suffering throughout world
My lovely friend Beth bought me @PBS US Presidents series on Bill Clinton http://t.co/9rdoNJhTy6 brilliant TV, @BBCPolitics should do same
Good catch up with @HinckleyRoadLPU to discuss local crime issues...plus apparently none...  http://t.co/zc5qOSWM2a http://t.co/yIEwgZz3D9
@ComIntCare also makes sure all social care staff fill out 'One Page Profiles' to get best match between staff & users & build strong teams
@ComIntCare has 'One Page Profiles' for all users. Starts with 'what I like, what's imp to me' before care & support needs #personalisation
Martin loves dancing (me too!) so @ComIntCare makes sure he can #personalisation http://t.co/21qTnpnqIR

Asked David Laws how pupil premium will be allocated when parents no longer need to apply for free school meals. Said he's "looking at it"
@RobbieGibb @afneil point taken!
@GabrielScally hard for MPs to get 'impartial' view, we rightly listen to local drs who may contest clinical data & proposed service changes
@RobbieGibb how about offering one of us a chance to interview @afneil ??
Easy to blame MPs but in my experience clinicians often disagree w each other about data & proposed service changes. That is the challenge.
Thanku @MegMunnMP @Debbie_abrahams @EmmaLewellBuck @BillEstersonMP @grahamemorris @SeemaMalhotra1 @jreedmp @BlaenauGwentMP #Labour #CareBill
Voted against #Clause119 and in favour of New Clause 16 #CareBill
@HPIAndyCowper @grahamemorris all roads lead back to Tories disastrous NHS reorganisation...(backed by LibDems)
@HPIAndyCowper @grahamemorris we warned that Health & Social Care Act would make right hospital changes harder not easier - lo & behold....
@ruthcarnall @andyburnhammp we don't forget - we remember how tough change can be, and the right and wrong way to do it...
@andyburnhammp: difficult NHS changes can be made based on clinical case & public engagement eg London stroke care @ruthcarnall #clause119
Sir Tony Baldry says he's disappointed @Jeremy_Hunt not in chamber for #Clause119 debate as greatly concerned about proposal
Bad judgement by @Jeremy_Hunt not to be in Commons for debate on Clause 119
Powerful speech by @drwollastonmp on care.data: sharing data crucial to improve health but must not gloss-over serious concerns #CareBill
Superb speech by @KeeleyMP on urgent need for NHS to identify and support unpaid family Carers - the time to act is now...
Shift power to communities to stop youth crime before it starts http://t.co/OgJBULV4Tv - really like this from @SteveReedMP & @DanJarvisMP

#CareBill today: @UKLabour amendments to identify family carers, tackle zero hrs contracts, 15min visits & care workers not getting min wage
@mroutled @legalaware agree: for integration to work must give power to people, my @Juncture_IPPR piece tomorrow is about precisely this

Wow. I'd forgotten how utterly brilliant #Vertigo is. Those last scenes…brutal, inevitable, heartrending. #perfectsundayfilm
Tbh @cnn's coverage & analysis of Ukraine crisis puts British broadcasters to shame…
Useful blog by @CNN's @FridaGhitis on Russia & Ukraine - links to Syria too http://t.co/pHtDjVaFV3
Russian upper house approves use of force in Ukraine http://t.co/DX9ydvJMry
On Monday Hague told me at times of crisis, channels of communication with Russia are "fully open". These seem one sided, to put it mildly..

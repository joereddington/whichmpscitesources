@lukebrough an anti-politics franchise, creating quite a nice income out of the public purse by being against everything and for Nowt.
Ah sweet, SNP MPs getting on like a house on fire with the new/old UKIP member #TartanTories #moreTorythantheTories
@ayestotheright @UKIP @tomwilliamsisme @MarkReckless which of Reckless or Carswell is the Hon Member for Hindsight?
UKIP flip-flopping on http://t.co/ZstsU0cCdS through Tory privatisation,& now saying they oppose it,whilst Farage said he'd privatise more!
Good luck to @naushabahkhan in Rochester & Strood today. By far and away the best candidate #Labour

Inundated with emails asking me to back @CliveEfford NHS bill this friday. I'll be backing it and fighting for our NHS.
@Sam_F__ and of course Welsh clubs play in the English league anyway...an anathema for Salmond, sturgeon and monochrome nationalists.
@Sam_F__ plus you can have steel City games. Motherwell v Boro, Sheffield, scunny etc
@Sam_F__ and possibly a club one as well, for all divisions. Going up to ParkHead & Ibrox,Hibs, Hearts,Aberdeen etc is great
@Sam_F__ totally agree with that. Should have a home nations cup...fans want it.
@Sam_F__ I was expecting a real fight. Wasn't there, apart from the subs you brought on. Home nation games of old were much better
@Sam_F__ very funny. Not quite the derby I thought it might be,but i suppose it was too friendly.
Tom backs action to get ‘a fair deal for local pubs’...and just voted for it  http://t.co/0eUNuXpEOJ

Off out on the #Labourdoorstep in Eagle Park, Marton, this afternoon with our petition to save local NHS services from Tory cuts
@macbloscaidh @LabourEoin closed blindcraft sites,sold off scotsrail,shafted steel workers over forth bridge.let in Thatcher.reminders ;-)
@VancouverOrca @Tom_Celt @the45plusers @LabourEoin @Jcqdnld actually one in three scots did,and assisted by SNP
@carbonlogix @Sam_F__ @Jcqdnld @LabourEoin well I intend to ;-)
@carbonlogix @Sam_F__ @Jcqdnld @LabourEoin much like the SNP/Greens/UKiP the lack of scritiny of all 3 has led people up the garden path
@carbonlogix @Sam_F__ @Jcqdnld @LabourEoin will be somewhere. however the NHS privatisation revelations work quite well.
@callumrsmith @LabourEoin was used to great effect for the 55% doorstep campaign.inc forth bridge SNP debacle/blindcraft closures etc
@carbonlogix @Sam_F__ @Jcqdnld @LabourEoin agree will have to examine they're funding as well.Mind,not one SNP lacky has problem with Souter
@carbonlogix @Sam_F__ @Jcqdnld @LabourEoin I ain't ukip. We're talking about another nationalist party that spouts lies the SNP.
@sky_traffic @dvdjcu @JohnEdginton @LabourEoin SNP will always do a deal, like with Thatcher in '79.
@Tom_Celt @the45plusers @LabourEoin @Jcqdnld nah SNP let Thatcher in, and you're just choosing to forget it. I'm not letting you.
@jwgillespie18 @dvdjcu @JohnEdginton @LabourEoin were you really duped by Salmond? Just asking.
@TiresiasGreen @LabourEoin I'll tell the bin men of Brighton then that eh?
@TiresiasGreen @LabourEoin ah of course, the greens. Supporting salmond's fossil fuelled indie plan. Irony klaxon.
@dvdjcu @JohnEdginton @LabourEoin yeah it was. Much like the forth bridge contract to China instead of UK steel contractors.
@dvdjcu @JohnEdginton @LabourEoin and now by a Dutch group, brought to you by the party for independence. Y' couldn't make it up.
@Jcqdnld @LabourEoin is Brian Souter one? Lol
@CrillyBobc @JohnEdginton @LabourEoin 2 words. Brian Souter.
@farrochie @EdDavie @LabourEoin ah of course, it's so clear. The semantics defence haha.
@jimofayr @LabourEoin we know where we are and where we are going due to what had happened. That is not old thinking, it's just common sense
@JohnEdginton @LabourEoin scotsrail was sold off by the present SNP Government.But you know just ignore all available evidence & carry on eh
@Sam_F__ @liz6153 @LabourEoin the SNP supporters response. To ignore all available evidence that Sturgeon et al are #TartanTories
@AGrandier nah I'm more concerned for things like the scottish steel industry which your SNP government are killing.
@Sam_F__ @LabourEoin now I didn't know that. I think that pretty much sums them up like.
@LabourEoin not right wing. A nationalist. No time for it. And nor should anyone who considers themselves of the left.
@alanferrier SNP are TattanToriea and attacked pro union Trade Unions. Go sell your lost cause elsewhere ta.
@LabourEoin erm Thatcher, Thatcher, Thatcher. Scotsrail? Forth bridge? Blindcraft? Blocking labour over living wage regs this year? Come on!
@LabourEoin and sturgeon redistributing vastly less amongst, vastly less (5m?) helps no one in Scotland. Not socialist, & not even sensible
@LabourEoin a nation of 60m UK nationals redistributing wealth for all under Ed Miliband. That is the best outcome for all.
@LabourEoin redistributing on the basis of nationality?Arguing a case-even if it damages her people's wealth?Not a socialist
@LabourEoin she ain't a socialist. You can't feed bairns flags.
@OckhamsShotgun and how many kids will all this persistent constitutional never ending dialogue feed exactly. Get some proper priorities.
@OckhamsShotgun no one cares. SNP let Thatcher in, and they not only betrayed scotland they betrayed all British working class communities
@OckhamsShotgun SNP just another version of the scabby SDP.
@OckhamsShotgun which party let Thatcher in? You can't feed bairns flags.
@nigel2john @LabourEoin oh aye.
@Stevie_A67 @LabourEoin & SNP did it again-mass blindcraft factory closures,sell off of scotsrail & steel contracts to China #TartanTories
@Stevie_A67 nah SNP let Thatcher in and participated in the mass deconstruction of industrial areas and working class politics #TartanTory
@LabourEoin except they did in 1979 by moving a no confidence motion against Callaghan. SNP scabs. #TartanTories
@LabourEoin except ah isn't increasing NHS budgets she is cutting them now #TartanTories
@Stevie_A67 @LabourEoin SNP let Tories in in '79. Learn thy history.
@LabourEoin no doubt she'll blame Westminster for her SNP MSPs voting that down of course. Yawn.
@LabourEoin well Sturgeon is a liar.The SNP are in power & blocked Labour's doing exactly that now http://t.co/L7zKIzFPR8 #TartanTories
The history the SNP is trying to forget & why Sturgeon and Salmond want us all to forget the #TartanTory roots of SNP http://t.co/0FD5uNMp7w
@Independent erm the SNP let Thatcher in, in 1979 #TartanTories
@SkyNews odd. The #TartanTory SNP let Thatcher in, in '79, they'll do anything a to undermine Labour.
Spent this am at Guisborough Xmas market @ St Nicholas' church hall then petitioning for local NHS services in Guisborough against Tory cuts
@whitbyfishing erm PFI, James cook's set up under Major govt whilst I believe Mr Farage was still a Tory supporter-till Maastricht of course
@whitbyfishing and of course UkIP are pro privatisation.as Farage let slip, and their deputy clearly stated (see pic) http://t.co/4tO9jektpI
@whitbyfishing as a point on debt, that has actually doubled to £1.4TN since May'10, and the deficit now is the largest in the EU
@whitbyfishing er no.97-2008 National debt decreased.huge investment in capital,staff,staff skills and pay.cont invest despite finance crash
@whitbyfishing er no. Record number of nurses,doctors,health workers and NHS investment. Tories and UKIP both don't believe in the NHS.
@20mbs no they haven't. UKIP are just another Tory party, and the more scrutiny only proves it. #moreTorythantheTories
At Acklam Rugby Club,Saltersgill Pavilion,this afternoon to meet up with Mark and other club officials & to talk about their future plans

@robbie9isgod @KarlTurnerMP er no. That doesn't make sense. Have you been talking to Gideon?
Respected today's 2minute silence at 11am with MPs,of all parties,in the House of Commons chamber for the 1914-2014 centenary of WW1.
@robbie9isgod @KarlTurnerMP Tories have accrued more debt in 4yrs (£700bn+) than Lab did in 13yrs,and have worst deficit in EU now #Toryfail
Is Theresa May gonna speak for 2h55mins to stop a motion put to not vote on Government's business? Tories treating parliament like a joke
Labour looking for common sense now and to end this farce and pushing to stop the Government's cop out motion from being voted upon.
Tory smoke & mirrors this week. NO halving of EU bill. NO new money for roads. NO #EAW vote.debt doubled in 4yrs, deficit largest in the EU.
Well Cameron has angered everyone and Theresa May has probably ruined her leadership hopes...A total farce.
Shambles now.Tories plan in the HofC only shows Cameron is a far more skilled hand than the EU commission at dodging parliament's consent
Chris Grayling compared to the glamorous assistant Debbie McGee...
Cameron lied to parliament re; allowing HofC a vote on the European Arrest Warrant.So why should anyone believe him about in/out referendum?
Speaker letting House know that the Government's supposed motion to vote on European Arrest Warrant doesn't discuss or allow a vote on it?!
@salardeen allowing media attacks? I'm fairly certain we don't allow or block media attacks. Just ignore nonsense.

Cameron is just an outright liar #NHS #CPC14 put that on your autocue.
Cameron is closing Hemlington medical centre,closed Skelton,closed Park End,closing Guisborough & E Cleveland Minor inj units #CPC14 liar.
It would appear Cameron wants to not only double the UK state debt, but now wants to take it beyond the £1.4TN mark #CPC14
@PaulBrandITV not Ni if on zero hours.

@BangryAstard @NicDakinMP after 13yrs of reducing Class sizes left the UK by Thatcher and Major, if you voted Tory...it's your fault.
Under Tories, pupils in classrooms with over 30 pupils has lept from 31k to 93k, as cash is spent on free schools irrespective of local need
@juneh49 no problem
Cameron says there are less children in poverty now, and also that black is most definitely white #PMQs

IDS "wait and you will see" universal credit will be marvellous. Total stuff of fantasy.

@garrie_coleman @ACunninghamMP @PhilWilsonMP @AndyMcDonaldMP agree
@rebeccamyles1 @Glawsterman just ask king Salmond who put Thatcher in, in 1979? It was of course #SNP #TartanTories
@rebeccamyles1 @Glawsterman yeah... But #naw anti-#tartantory
@PeterSpeirsUK: No lectures from Salmond on poverty, after he cut £1 billion from anti-poverty measures in Scotland #bbcindyref
@janephillips50 which of course didn't happen
@janephillips50 and so do I, and it certainly is true
@janephillips50 also not only would the Scottish economy be worse of, our north east economy would be very hard hit.last thing we need
@janephillips50 take steel.salmond chose China over Scunthorpe steel,despite scots workers that went there after Craig shut.poor leadership
@janephillips50 no Britain need Scotland full stop.however, NHS,welfare,pensions,currency etc etc no plan from #tartantory SNP
@janephillips50 salmond is a huge bully and darling is spot on
@janephillips50 and one can make an argument to show Edinburgh is even more alien to Orkney, Shetland (and certainly Glasgow)
@janephillips50 Westminster, like any tool, is only useful to whom, and by whom is using it.Salmond has no plan for an indie Edinburgh Govt
@janephillips50 and NHS of course delivered by a Westminster English,Scottish,welsh,northern Irish ...Labour Government.
@janephillips50 not Westminster, Tories. Put in by SNP in '79 and bolstered by Libdems now. salmond is a #tartantory
International leaders will be looking at Alex Salmond's bullying manner. Not a good advert for Scotland if he becomes President Salmond.
@janephillips50 it clearly is.
Salmond's plan for an seperate scotland's currency is to walk in front of his podium.
@janephillips50 just check his voting record voting against this govt.
@janephillips50 nah.
@janephillips50 he isn't like.
Salmond condemns way disabled are treated? Oh really, so why did SNP councils close blindcraft factories before recession? #tartantory
Salmons condos way disabled are treated? Oh really, so why did SNP councils close blind craft factories before recession? #tartantory
http://t.co/onuGPwVISa Salmond's making NHS nurses work for nowt in Scotland #tartantory
Post office has never been privatised...dear me
Salmond your SNP party put Thatcher in back in 1979!
Salmond's now thieving Cameron's anti-Labour lines for Wales, by attacking welsh NHS...pathetic #tartantory remember SNP put Thatcher in!
Salmond's wandering again...
@DanielPJMaguire nah.

The number of over-90s brought to A&E by ambulance in England has risen by 81% in the past 3 years @teesyounglabour  http://t.co/6ZW1vx9J1n
.@TeesYoungLabour perhaps @iswales can explain the leap in private ambulance funding at NEAS from £90k in 2009 to over £700k in 2012-13?
.@TeesYoungLabour of course under LibDem logic=Newcastle's fault that NE trust is under resourced,& not the fault of the Govt they prop up
Thanks for the #ff @Rosiecosy @KeeleyMP @Debbie_abrahams @KarlTurnerMP @LilianGreenwood @andyburnhammp @grahamemorris @AndySawfordMP

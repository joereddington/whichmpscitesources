Utter shambles by May & Gove. Promised a vote on EAW & backed down because of backbench pressure. When will vote on EAW be held?

Welcome action by FCA on Wonga, forcing 330,000 loans to be written off & other borrowers given relief on interest http://t.co/QL5W21y4Xw
Human Rights Act protects freedom of speech & ECHR underpins our devolution settlement within UK - crazy for Cameron to propose scrapping it
Osborne in 2008: "if he doesn't explain how it is going to be paid for then it isn't a tax cut". Applies to Cameron's speech today
Over £7bn in unfunded tax cuts from 2018 pre-announced by Cameron - surely he should tell us now how he's planning to pay for them?
Cameron forgot to say how he's going to pay for the big tax cuts he pre-announced today - any takers on where/whom they're coming from?
Does Cameron support @UKLabour plan for guaranteed minimum hours at work if someone has been in a job for a year?
Wonga profits slump after compensation costs & crackdown - see my comments in the FT's coverage http://t.co/Ewp9duXpHo
Osborne's made his choice: more pain/inequality for ordinary working people. No wonder polls say Britain's on course to choose change in May
Osborne quoting "independent experts": these would be the same ones he doesn't want to evaluate opposition policies before General Election?
Has Osborne forgotten that under him people in Britain have suffered the biggest slump in real wages since the 1870s?

Best anti-poverty strategy a living wage: yet SNP did not use their devolved powers to extend it to maximum number of Scots #bbcindyref
Fallacy of Salmond's argument - people in England, Wales & NI cannot be forced into a currency union against their wishes #bbcindyref
EU rules require aspirant member states to have central bank to join: sterlingization would leave Scotland without one #bbcindyref

Hugely encouraged by #DarlingWin tonight, but back on the doorstep tomorrow morning, noon & night until September 18 #NoThanks
56% of voters say @TogetherDarling won the big debate tonight #DarlingWin #nothanks
No answers, no passion, no compelling case to separate Scotland from UK from Salmond - only one winner tonight #Darlingwin #ScotDecides
Great stuff from @TogetherDarling - passionate, funny, articulate & incisive. Scotland can have best of both worlds #nothanks #ScotDecides
The IFS are wrong, the OBR is wrong, the Governor of the Bank of England's wrong - in Salmond's world everyone's wrong but him #scotdecides
What coins will be in our pockets if there is a Yes vote?What will protect bank accounts? Salmond thinks these qns beneath him #ScotDecides
Desperate & dismal stuff from Salmond - offering up weak newspaper cuttings but all at sea on the currency and central bank #ScotDecides
What will be Scotland's Central bank in event of Yes vote? Salmond looking extraordinarily shifty in dodging the big question #ScotDecides
Salmond doesn't even sound convinced himself on his weak answers on currency - is the Panama option the currency plan B #ScotDecides
Killer line from @TogetherDarling on currency - studio audience & nobody else buying Salmond's bluster on the pound #ScotDecides
Salmond obfuscating on currency - what will be Scotland's central bank in event of Yes vote? It won't be the Bank of England #ScotDecides
55% of people in Scotland voted against an SNP Government in 2011 but got one anyway #ScotDecides
My constituents voted @scottishlabour at last 2 Holyrood elections but got an SNP Government - they didn't get the Government they voted for
Salmond talks of more powers - he didn't use the powers Holyrood has already to maximise living wage for Scots #ScotDecides

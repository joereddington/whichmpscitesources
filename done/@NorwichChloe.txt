@SteveMorphew Easy maths as well as reading. 2014+10years=2024. No secret. Will start in CP5. That's what a long term project looks like. Tue Mar 03 16:53:09 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew Most immediate of all: your party's policy would destroy investment in new trains by changing the next franchise yet again Tue Mar 03 16:49:34 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew It exists for the 1000s passengers & biz who support the campaign. Infrastructure delivered over next 10 yrs, no mystery there Tue Mar 03 16:47:52 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew You were the future once, eh? Tue Mar 03 16:43:03 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew And because we need better infrastructure, our campaign asked for £500m worth and got it. Tue Mar 03 16:41:37 GMT 2015
The upcoming election is the most important for a generation. Your decision can mean a secure economy. http://t.co/yur2IjXmdh Tue Mar 03 16:40:34 GMT 2015

@SteveMorphew ...Which is why you don't want to talk about new trains because your policy demolishes the badly-needed investment in those Tue Mar 03 16:38:52 GMT 2015
@SteveMorphew @jhilk19 Steve, the delay today was about a broken train. Do stay in touch with local issues. Tue Mar 03 16:35:23 GMT 2015

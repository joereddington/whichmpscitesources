@BillyMorrison67 lol. The majority you mean? Absurd
@BillyMorrison67 er, no
Scotland crowd booing Aiden McGeady for playing for Ireland, at Celtic Park. Wow.
@yoker_afc no really, you bringing a great club into disrepute here. Shouldn't you be watching the football?
@taigstaigs what was his fee and was it paid in diamonds?
@yoker_afc are you sure Yoker Athletic are aware that you have slipped your strait jacket?
@yoker_afc the biscuit is yours. That is the most pathetic tweet I have ever received. And that's saying something...
@h8kes Bradford: Getting Better every Day
@AndyClark22 Aiden McGeady. 1-0
@TwittyODriscoll I want ALL my friends on Twitter to be IN Bradford on the opening day!
Wow... When I arrived in Bradford this was a hole in the ground... http://t.co/83VPnflDze

Will Dave Boy Green @dave4wibsey new member Khaddam Hussein starting ten year stretch in prison qualify for reduced party subs...?
@Che_Brent @Nigel_Farage by popular demand...
@CynicalGent now now Mr Powell-Bigot @Nigel_Farage will have to kick you out of the party...
@CPLoyalString I hate Britain so much I spent a year saving it from being broken up.
It is a great paper you know... Pick it up in W Yorks or online at http://t.co/mRAClMYZ4S http://t.co/TJAHvc2cDT

@TommyCharlton indeed they are
@CynicalGent @UtopianFireman @Nigel_Farage @UKIP Ah a Powellite for UKIP. Thought you were cleaning up the act @Nigel_Farage
@brewer_lar @DailyMirror @KTHopkins Should you be writing that, being a British Army Vet ?
@Harris_Emma but you were 12 then...
@Harris_Emma How so Emma :-)
@ascentofmoney no
@mikesey1 @DailyMirror @KTHopkins No. But the Sun tried
@MurrayFlint @jck1955 @howdyandy @Nigel_Farage @ddavidhealey54 let's see. We'd draw a great crowd
@jck1955 @howdyandy @UtopianFireman @Nigel_Farage @ddavidhealey54 well then let's get it on. We could fill the Albert Hall...
@ArnhemAvenger @giantearthworm @DailyMirror  No but when people are boasting how english they are it helps if they know our from are

@BristolComSense @UtopianFireman @Holbornlolz @Nigel_Farage @UKIP @RespectPartyUK why is Nigel afraid of debating me?
@reknihteerf now that I know you're a Blairite this correspondence is now closed
@Sher_Veganchick @myfootballfacts @JakeTilley23 a now your mask is slipping... Bye
@giantearthworm @DailyMirror @KTHopkins Are streets?
@DailyMirror @KTHopkins I wish it had been rat-faced b***h. But it was rat-faced f**k
@reknihteerf if the question contains a defamatory imputation ie Have you stopped beating your wife? The questioner could be in trouble
@reknihteerf @MayorLutfur @ken4london what I earn I declare. No declaration means no pay. I know you know it defamatory to imply otherwise
@Sher_Veganchick @JakeTilley23 you're welcome to your view. Anyone of course can come to Bradford. We can't ban anyone.
@reknihteerf @MayorLutfur @ken4london @UKLabour are you actually insane? Paid? To speak for democracy in TH? You must think I'm Tony Blair!
@Sher_Veganchick @JakeTilley23 but I didn't. The 4% of Israelis who opposed the massacre in Gaza are most welcome
@reknihteerf @MayorLutfur @ken4london @UKLabour what does that mean?
@dunccup10 none. I admired him. Before Laura's masterclass...
@nelsabbey it was a triple answer. Sitting in his office given away then back to his office :-)
@nelsabbey exactly
@Busketeer_2 @jonnyapp it was "sitting in his office" then a charidee gift within 30 seconds. He forgot his Â£16.000 watch from Brazil :-)
@palestininianpr @jonnyapp Lord Triesman the former Maoist turned Lord who expelled me from the Labour Party :-)
@michaelshaw1983 I don't care who does or doesn't this is my twitter account and my opinion
@Glasgow_Red quite

@WolfeTonesGhost I'm not Irish. I believe in unity not separation. That's all.
@WolfeTonesGhost I am a man of the world. "Nations" mean nothing to me. My flag is red.
@0_jidu @scottg1975 my mates?
@FALLLFAN @MuhammedRaza786 @ukrespectparty eh? The organisers...
@prcfry @Presstvuk that's no answer. Why?
@prcfry @Presstvuk why?
@rohailamjad you think it's me you have to convince?
@prcfry @Presstvuk No
@rohailamjad I'm afraid you don't know the law here. But why criticise me? I'm the only one who fought for his arrest
@rohailamjad me?
@usman9294 @Presstvuk lower than a snakes belly. That's the program maker. The Sheikh? Unprintable
@ant_moh @Presstvuk what do you think it would be Anthony?
@improvorpmi @Presstvuk Sean Penn or Oliver Stone
@taj_law1987 does your Mrs know you write obscene words on toilet walls and run away?
If I could get onto the leaders debates for the general election Respect @ukrespectparty would win one million votes.
@canvascomfort no you are actually lying. Not wrong but lying. Even though the whole thing is on line. Shameful. Shameless.
@AndyReilly3 you are welcome to it
@canvascomfort @heraldscotland @Aidan_Kerr1 whoever said such a foolish thing? Certainly not me
Big thanks to @TwittyODriscoll for the @rustyrockets football book x
@Rob_Merrick pity about the unmonitored defamatory racist filth in the comments underneath @realmckay
@Winston_5mith @heraldscotland @Aidan_Kerr1 When did they try to kill Neil Lennon?
@Winston_5mith @heraldscotland @Aidan_Kerr1 We WERE treated like Ebola cases. In a tract, from the Church of Scotland
@heraldscotland @Aidan_Kerr1 Ask Neil Lennon...
@BFD_Politix @GSutcliffeMP @OmarKhans @PPSolicitor wow. My knees are knocking in fear
@BFD_Politix @GSutcliffeMP @PPSolicitor @OmarKhans what's her name?
@BFD_Politix @GSutcliffeMP @OmarKhans @PPSolicitor who?
@devastating101 @ukrespectparty the voice of Scottish nationalism. Progressive huh?
If necessary, @ukrespectparty will come back to Tower Hamlets and punish New Labour for their shameful behaviour http://t.co/TFYWrthojq
Watch my broadcast at http://t.co/2MgnX1MOBe
Arrived in Tower Hamlet, speaking next so tune in to http://t.co/IZ5oC0r3iJ #defendlutfurrahman
Follow me on http://t.co/IZ5oC0r3iJ and watch me live at the rally for Mayor Lutfur Rahman tonight!
@tcliverpool Terry; he is headed for defeat. That's a fact. We can't afford that. Get Burnham in ffs
@KarlTurnerMP indeed I do. But you don't win because you can't afford to lose. You win by getting 12 million votes. Seen the polls?
@DeLiberationinf @meadstweet you mean the guy who told the Jewish Chronicle "I am a Zionist"?
@KarlTurnerMP have you read the polls?
@CoombesMostyn anybody.
@seanjmcg @ken4london @MayorLutfur really? Lol
@Charles_Thechip have you read today's poll...?
@kevosullivan07 @DelStrainComedy er, no, I didn't. What are you, 12?
@DeLiberationinf like hell he does
@cocojambo75 anybody. I mean that.
@laquamariner I don't care. He is leading the party to defeat
@joeyedwards95 anybody!! He is throwing the election!!
By persisting with Miliband the most unpopular leader ever New Labour are committing a crime against working people in Britain. Get him out.
@seanjmcg @ken4london @MayorLutfur and you want start with Bengali guy...
@ModdosserStuart @taigstaigs @DanielHouston5 oh... A lot of point
@mflack66 @Jimmusic801 a genius. "Stalin wasn't stallin when he told the Beast of Berlin"...
@seanjmcg @ken4london @MayorLutfur can't help but suspect you "concern trolling" here Sean...
New Labour has made a gigantic mistake with their neck-deep involvement in the anti-democratic coup against @MayorLutfur Both seats now up..
@seanjmcg @ken4london @MayorLutfur none that a Tory minister is fit to ask. That's for the court to decide. But we both know that's nowhere
@johnellison @Presstvuk if it was a Labour Party of course.
@seanjmcg @ken4london @MayorLutfur you mean the elected Mayor? The twice elected Mayor?
My new vodcast on Egypt coming soon...
@lennivlek @ken4london @MayorLutfur with the Tories? Six months before the election ?
@FikreJesus @ken4london @MayorLutfur don't know I'm not organising just speaking
@BazDoherty you may be right, there may not be five. There is one, me. And Neil Lennon I guess. He got a warm welcome in Scotland. Not.
@lennivlek @ken4london @MayorLutfur sure. But it's the elections which count. And Pickles intentions are racist and Islamophobic
@PaulMoss7971 not much
@h8kes @ken4london @MayorLutfur they do alas
@lennivlek @ken4london @MayorLutfur apart from the majority who just re elected the Mayor you mean?
@HarryBradyCU but Scotland is the joint colonial master...
On my way to speak at Water Lilly Gardens Tower Hamlets tonight alongside @ken4london and @MayorLutfur against the racist witch hunt in TH
@scotland5finest @bridos @Rossco1876  you are welcome. But it is changed days. Celtic players seldom selected used to be booed for Scotland
@AngryBoi_GFB wow
@DrNHS they voted. No.
@bridos @Rossco1876 really?
@Debsbuchanan welcome
@bridos @Rossco1876 that Celtic players were routinely discriminated against. Jinky had 24 caps though one of the best in the world
@secular786 @BBhuttoZardari you know these are criminal offences you are committing?
@bridos @Rossco1876 you can do what you like
@bridos @Rossco1876 dig???? He was great! The dig was at the SFA
@bridos @Rossco1876 what's that got to do with Scotland v Ireland? And we know why the great Joe McBride only won 2 caps
@secular786 @BBhuttoZardari As sexist racism goes that takes the biscuit Sir. My wife has 4 degrees and is an Indonesian anthropologist
@McGettiganIrene er, Ireland is a different country. Except the six occupied counties
@taigstaigs Coatbridge. 1968
Celtic fans welcome to support the country which colonised the land of their fathers then "welcomed" us as immigrants like a case of Ebola
@davybhoy05 I think perhaps you misread the tweet to which you are responding
@MartinMcLaughla @scarletpimp2012 @GerryBraiden what does that mean?
@scarletpimp2012 The Republic of Ireland
@RyanZaina @PaddyDoyle12345 it is not and never has been. But it has terrorised and occupied the world. Starting with Ireland
@TheSnappyBoss @markbairden He just might...
@TippleJack @M1TSIRUGI Giles was a fantastic player and is a great RTE pundit
@TippleJack @M1TSIRUGI he was truly great
@PaddyDoyle12345 lol why would I care how you see me you pompous prick?
@taigstaigs magnificent!!
@gerry1888diamon No. Obvious.
@Celliott97 do scroll down
@FatbhoyTom if you knew how pitiful that reads...
@Fraser_92 @SouthStandDon @DavieDhouse Ah remember when the Yessers told us how anti war they were...
@0_jidu sure
@AHBowie1874 @serialsockthief it does
@TheBoyMcNicoll @DavieDhouse that's right. Aka Tipperary. Although you probably want to forget that
@weeshug72 fair enough that's up to you. Times are changing obviously. An Irish club is becoming Scottish and forgetting where/what it was
@PaddyDoyle12345 Ireland is not a tribe. It's a country occupied and colonised by England and Scotland
@PaddyDoyle12345 my father believed patriotism was the last refuge of the scoundrel. He was anti imperialist to his bones God rest him.
@Ally__Mack er... I'm an MP in Bradford
@DavieDhouse then you never really knew me at all...
@Snoopbear69 if you knew the history...
@craig_gamble93 Ireland of course
@ClmRbrts a cut out and keep that one
@DavieDhouse I'm supporting Ireland
@eamyr11 the fact that you can describe ME as a "closet Tory" speaks volumes of the madness to which you have fallen prey
@Caoimhinalba pitiful. Quite pitiful.
@OhaganDavid eloquent indeed...
@warn1888 eloquent...
@bhoyy88 what's a "real Scot " Kev? Is it a blood thing?
@johnpaulburton @PaulMac_11 @gauldygauld the voice of Scottish nationalism
@Stewieofff @gauldygauld au contraire
NO Celtic fan of Irish descent would EVER have supported Scotland over Ireland in the past. Now, it seems, all of them are. Changed days...
@AyeAyePopEye I'm backing my country actually
@attendant1867 you're welcome. I'm supporting Ireland. If you know, the history it's enough to make your heart go oh oh oh
@Bigdawny1 naw. Just at the history books
@rodbhoy really? Do you know any of the history of Scotland and Ireland?
@LouiseZuzu @DavyBhoy7 @AineAislingMam @mooneynulson lol
@seanmcleod19 "proud nation"? I pity your ignorance. The nation that colonised Ulster you mean? Terrorised the "natives" in Aden.
@MikeHoxard not old Ireland either by the look of things here.
@Falconcry sure. Which do you think they will?
@gauldygauld unlikely as I will be supporting Ireland. I've kept the faith you see.
@taigstaigs ah but the "green Scot-Nat brigade" are well wrapped up in it now. Me? I prefer the tricolour myself...
@mooneynulson wow. Just wow.
@frankiemcfc what does that even mean you ignorant moron?
Which team will the green newly tartan bedecked Scottish Nationalists be supporting at Celtic Park on Friday btw? #justaskin
@cordhos @Chris_Lane1989 what? A "Pape"? To where? Ireland? Now that the famine is over?
@DavyBhoy7 @1081Belfast the voice of green Scottish nationalism. Which can't even spell.
Isn't it funny how Murdoch's Times journalists think themselves above their Sun etc colleagues. Just whores with better shoes. That's all.
@davidbyers26 really? What is a Murdoch hireling doing here anyway? Go fuck yourself in your organised crime gang HQ
All hail the memory of President Yasser Arafat murdered this day ten years ago by Israel and it's agents. Thowra hat'l Nas'r
@Petersbrooking @alyn1957 @Dubdanu you mean she is sober when she says these things?
@TippleJack @debbiesimone123 @ayesha_sk @the_wharf that's what labour in Tower Hamlets has become sadly. Carrying Eric Pickles bag...
@lionumar very happy for David and I wish him every success
@lydiapaynter @Ibrahimhalawi @RoyalHolloway he knows that which is why he couldn't answer himself
@Ibrahimhalawi @RoyalHolloway And did I?
I will be on @RT_com news at 10pm London time tonight on the crimes and corruption of @TheBlairDoc Tony Blair
@JOD45 @AAlazaibi @RHUL_PIRSoc the cool cat in the hat :-)
@TwittyODriscoll didn't see it sorry been busy

@Ninas5Nina @TeamGeorgeG it's on it's way...
@Dt86David @ukrespectparty on here
Pat McFadden former communist now Blairite, shadow Europe minister on 5 Live now supported Miliband as the rope supports the hanging man...
@ayesha_sk leave that to me sister. You worried about the meeting for some reason?
@ayesha_sk @the_wharf democracy sister. It's a worldwide thing...
I will be on @RT_com at 10pm London time tonight on Tony Blair @TheBlairDoc
@ayesha_sk @the_wharf eh?
Is a new intifadeh coming in the West Bank and Jerusalem? And this time will it include 1948 Palestine? I think yes to both...
Friday and Saturday I will be in Bradford @ukrespectparty
Thursday I will be live on @COMMENT_PressTV
And Tuesday I may or may not be on the @russellhoward show BBC2....
I'm speaking Wednesday in Tower Hamlets with @ken4london and @MayorLutfur at Water Lily Gardens. Better come early :-) @ukrespectparty
I'm speaking tonight at Royal Holloway @ukrespectparty
@timlad @bricklanecoffee ?
@assif26 @BBhuttoZardari I assure you that Bilawal is no "Zionist". That's a very foolish thing to say. Absurd actually.
@assif26 @BBhuttoZardari not in Oxfordshire you won't. Do you really think I do things "for votes"? How cheap do you think I am?
@knightsofpk @BBhuttoZardari "having fun"? At the launch of a book about his murdered mother? Have some decency Sir.
With @BBhuttoZardari at Oxford Union launch of new book on my friend and comrade Benazir Bhutto. May God preserve him http://t.co/rcWfWd2XIn
@entropy664 @MurtazaGeoNews @ShahNafisa BB was my friend and comrade for 25 years. I will never leave her children
@craighill13 @ukrespectparty we will have a major push in London in 2016
We @ukrespectparty are seeking a parliamentary candidate in the Dudley North constituency against the rancid rabid Ian Austin MP. Maj 500
Tony Blair. Labour leader, prime minister, Saudi Arabian rent boy. Wow. @TheBlairDoc
@SeaSharker @KenKenhall65 @TheBlairDoc Chilcot????????
@otivar55 "Ed" is a guarantee of another Tory government
@C82578768 Alan Johnson MP is the only man who can get the Tories out. Which is a national imperative
Tony Blair, the Middle East Peace Envoy and secret Rent Boy to the head slicing Saudi dictatorship. You couldn't make it up. Don't have to..
Tony Blair the war criminal and grubby mountebank and Ed Miliband the dead duck. Look what they've done to the once proud party of Labour...
@th71405256 @TheBlairDoc I wonder why...
@TheBlairDoc our film is having difficulty keeping up with crimes and corruption of Tony Blair...
@perryscope21 @TeamGeorgeG @ukrespectparty ?
@Liam_McDougall_ oh ye of little faith
@TwoWheels3 where they wanted to be. And it's your business how?
@OAdlamSaunders @DavidHumphreysA get a life
At the Shapla Bangla Centre in Bradford today http://t.co/Ulm3LGK3eF
@Liam_McDougall_ I do don't you?
@proboy82 about what?
@proboy82 eh ?
@barc1985 absurd
I support Gerry Sutcliffe MPs call for an elected Mayor for West Yorkshire and would support him for it. We mustn't get left behind Mancs...
@enochfanakapan I have :-)
@DavidHumphreysA I joined only briefly in the bitter cold these heroes who have been picketing McDonald's for 96 days already. #Palestine
@bobsixkiller Bombay Blues
At re opening of Smorgasbord in Bradford's Kirkgate. Always a feast of a place now a cornucopia of culinary delight http://t.co/4Veggyap8i
@dianehain @M1TSIRUGI it has to be Alan Johnson MP
@SturgeonSexy well is she said today was Friday I couldn't deny it. How's the oil price looking btw?
@KKTC1974 corned beef. Nice actually :-)
@dianehain @M1TSIRUGI he's a dead parrot I'm sorry to say
@khanxas I gave up the train waiting for my car but thanks :-)
@Royceewoo I do. But Ed just doesn't have it...
@khanxas signal failure all round...
@KKTC1974 If British Rail had the public subsidy the privatised railways have had we could've been like Japan!
@TheHaaHaaMan ???
@KKTC1974 yes it was
Now arrived Donny 41 miles from Bradford and long line of duties delayed. Let the train take the strain?
@dianehain @M1TSIRUGI crikey that's not saying much! But what good is he if he can't persuade people of that?
British capitalism sure can't run a railroad; at least not to Bradford. Having almost made it then headed back to Donny now stuck outside...
@Royceewoo But leaders must be able to communicate and to lead. He is a flop a failure a cold fish floundering his mouth opening but...
Having almost reached Bradford my train is now heading backwards to Doncaster where everyone has to bale out. Hope I run into Ed !
@notimetom you think Alan Johnson is a "closet Tory"? You obviously never met a real one
@TippleJack he didn't plead guilty until today. He had several opportunities to do so. His trial was set for Monday. Great expense already.
@hoppy1848 @TippleJack methought you doth protest too loudly :-)
@hoppy1848 @TippleJack ok Mike the K is in the post...
@hoppy1848 @TippleJack it isn't Labour and it sure isn't a leadership. Change now
@RiazGilani no. He has not repented
Neil Masterton pleads guilty to ABH assault on me, will be sentenced December 5th. He remains in custody.
Any news from the Crown Court?
@Neilccfc missing my point. If Cameron wins Scotland is gone. No more GB no more Labour.
@AlexeiGaran @paganpirate well it could be that you are wrong? :-)
@Neilccfc sure. But this is a national emergency. Now.
@oldcastle1 stand firm? He can't chew gum and walk in a straight line
@Neilccfc if Cameron gets back in Britain will be finished, literally.
@Neilccfc enough for now! Burnham is the best long term choice
@AlexeiGaran @paganpirate No, socialism or barbarism remains the dichotomy
@Neilccfc No. Miliband has failed comprehensively as a leader and a man.
@hoppy1848 I follow the discipline of the working class. That's all. They are clearly saying, Miliband is a Turkey.
@OBeoneobrien because we need the Tories out
We need the Tories out. Miliband continuing in office gravely endangers that. Only Alan Johnson MP can lead Labour to victory. Change now.
@MoAnsar @JohnEdginton what is?
@Britt_W @DavidJEWood she said it alright
@leejohnson79 vaguely sinister actually...
Is it just me or is Melanie Phillips increasingly hysterically majestically utterly utterly stark raving bonkers ?
@KenKenhall65 @Naheed973 @JohnWight1 more a thicket :-)

@PaulMoss7971 @ukrespectparty it's a deal
@PaulMoss7971 @ukrespectparty welcome
@PaulMoss7971 join @ukrespectparty
@PaulMoss7971 nobody bullies me Paul:-) I get knocked down, but I get up again...
@SteDog2u going great out as soon as possible.
@mikek18mdh_mike well all the more credit to him then
@NatBuster I'm not a member of the Labour Party. But looks like he is going to win. And will scrap the ban.
So; Jim Murphy is pledged to end the so called football sectarianism ban targeting mainly Celtic supporters. The SNP pledge to keep it...
@PaddyBoru1014 ?
Good defensive performance against Real by much maligned Rodgers' Liverpool. They are confounding critics tonight, so far at least...
@GarryBoyle41 he is in any case still entirely without remorse
don't get all these complaints about the 20 year sentence on the murderer of Ann Maguire. I think it difficult to see her killer out at all
@TwittyODriscoll @TippleJack @cybermate007 No. Toren means tower in Dutch, mountain or chieftain in Scots and Irish Gaelic
@TippleJack @TwittyODriscoll @cybermate007 it's Dutch and Gaelic

@raymonddelauney @hadeelalsayegh @TippleJack @Triska my friend the late great Sheikh Zayed wouldn't !
@SiPick yes
@hadeelalsayegh @TippleJack @Triska @raymonddelauney that is a lie
@MrSubsea I'm paid in Euros, by Associated Press.
@MrSubsea @RT_com @BBCNews now I know you're having a laugh. Both are state owned and govt controlled
@Triska @hadeelalsayegh @raymonddelauney you are not a journalist.
@TwittyODriscoll you are back on form comrade x
@Anisah7Slevin these arms of mine; I've been loving you too long...
On a long drive listening to Otis Reading. How truly great he was. Thanks to my cousin Eddie Dougan who introduced me to Stax Records 1968
@pafotogunisy lol. Who?
@SiPick @ukrespectparty not yet but we are open to it @ukrespectparty
@MohsinAliChanna fine
@NickWren95 try Google YouTube Hansard. You are a student right?
@NickWren95 we continue to arm them so the question is otiose. Just gtf out of the Middle East ok?
@MohsinAliChanna yes. We are about to launch Respect in Mauritius !
@NickWren95 when you're in a hole stop digging
@NickWren95 the opposite lol
ISIL and Al Qaeda combine to wipe out Revolutionary Front of Syria. Life of Brian. And we are arming directly and indirectly all of them.
What was Joel Barnett's formula for such a long life? He has died at the great age of 91. A great friend of Scotland. RIP
@angrydadd @BBCRadio2 As a former victim myself I would like to chair this Inquiry. I fear none in the establishment which prob rules me out
@groteskmischief @fleetstreetfox No. I have never been contacted on this matter.
@TLC2015 @ZacGoldsmith no not only for wrongdoing that is Cameron's plan
@TippleJack @MrUrbanmeister @maxjfreeman he is the ermine robed baron who started the rot. Him and his family ended up "alright" alright.
@alanmonolith @fleetstreetfox I have never used a Thesaurus
@TLC2015 @ZacGoldsmith yes it gives them the power to sack the MP between elections for any reason
@TLC2015 no because of the last part. I believe in @ZacGoldsmith plan for Recall of MPs instead
@fleetstreetfox @TheSundayMirror Fox: you did NOT contact me. If you had I would've said yes.
@KenKenhall65 is he an entertainer?
@maxjfreeman thank God they all stayed...
"Griff Rhys Jones to Quit UK if Labour Wins". A Nation Mourns...
@AwoLiberal @fleetstreetfox that's because it's untrue. The Sunday Mirror never asked me or us @ukrespectparty
@MrSubsea I'm responsible only for my content. Mr Putin never tried to influence that. @RT_com a great station, streets ahead of any other
@MrSubsea I'm proud of our program on @RT_com
@ghazi_dimashqi I didn't know God was on Twitter?The Lord of all the Worlds will decide the fate of us all. My sins don't include that one.
@MaashMaa most people reading this are in doubt as to what your purpose is
@NUTSY10 @LFBFireFairy @austingayer sorry Jason you are off the park...
@NUTSY10 Jason ; if you want to divide deserving workers one against the other for the benefit of the undeserving
@MaashMaa by the way I never heard your oh so Islamic answer to my question. What's is the justification for slaughtering prisoners?
@NUTSY10 @LFBFireFairy @austingayer and how will they be helped by a defeat of the firefighters?
@DeanBrentnall1 of course
@TwittyODriscoll move over Darling :-)
@MaashMaa I have spoken to people who were THERE. My relations with Iraq are long and deep brother and will last longer than yours.
@austingayer wow
@kallie_crabz are you a Tory minister or what? Why are you on here disrespecting the firefighters ?
@austingayer you were praying in aid of your hatred of the FBU the views of a dead firefighter which you claim mysteriously to know...
@MaashMaa I watch neither. My information comes from the front. On which the Iraqis are moving decisively against you.
@a1fire999 I have
@frame_bill @KarenDanczuk Good thanks. I think.
@kallie_crabz why are so against the firefighters Lily? And why do you dress it up with faux concern for farmers?
@2jdward Islam is not a cult. It is a great monotheistic religion with 2 billion believers
@MaashMaa the women and children you murdered weren't civilians? Really?
@austingayer @FF_England do you commune with dead often?
@MaashMaa they are Sunnis. You are not God. Iraq will finish with you now, as they did before
@kallie_crabz firefighters save US from danger. Why would you quibble like this? Victory to the FBU!
@MaashMaa the 50 you massacred today WERE Sunnis!!!
@lpowell84 you think ISIL would turn up to an international conference? What pacifist naivety is this? Victory to Iraq against foreign arms
@lpowell84 you prefer only one side has guns ?
@cityboy1957 you seemed to all be rather anxious toward the end. Against 10 men. For 60 minutes.
@MaashMaa 43 men four women three children. What's the justification for massacring unarmed prisoners in cold blood? Iraq will defeat you.
@Banaadiri it will allow them to defend themselves against mass cold blooded murder like Thursday and today!
@TwittyODriscoll @CPTTraining John White Dave McKay Bill Brown Alan Gilzean... Fond memories
@GarryBoyle41 no it has been Utd since Denis Law
Victory to the Firefighters. Long live the FBU. Heroes being attacked by villains.
Today's massacre in Anbar of 50 men women children by ISIL will be the beginning of their end in Iraq. The tribes in the west must be armed
@woodmartin68 I don't know the case but if so of course I would condemn it
@woodmartin68 for what?
@VolunteerGerry Judas betrayed Jesus and his own beliefs. I have done neither. Your vile slander shows what you not I have become.
@Taxiforwoody actually I doubt that is the "most" relevant thing. Not for me anyway.
@VolunteerGerry the voice of Scottish nationalism. Wow just wow...
@Taxiforwoody sometimes one is defined by how one conducts one's self in defeat. It's a pity you can't see that
Proud of Man Utd today, Wayne Rooney especially

@AdamMac42 @Keengstn @Carlito_East @taigstaigs definitely more than 2p
@taigstaigs never write Harry off...
@BFD_Politix @Ifti7860 @DavidWardMP @ukrespectparty we will have to consider this matter. We will do so next weekend.
Rarely ungenerous re opponents literary efforts but I must say Boris's new Churchill is a slipshod error-strewn piece of poppycock.
@TippleJack @carolynmorgan72 @amiztaha @TeamGeorgeG Maladroit Miliband of the Lower Fifth
Imagine how many ways he could've handled it (or eat the bacon sandwich)? How Burnham would've handled it? How Alan Johnson would've ? Sigh
Catch @RT_sputnik at 1.30pm on @RT_com Sky 512 Freeview 85
@JungleLion_ the writing sure but the story is Keane's
@Lightyear_87 evidence?
If you like football, Man Utd, Celtic, Ireland or in my case all four the new Roy Keane autobiography is a simply coruscating read...
@Samlukee why give her 2p then?
@GreeGreece positive
@Lightyear_87 "likely he did"? What does that mean?
@Oscar6l @BroganRoganTrev generosity? 2p? From a millionaire ?
@Lightyear_87 show me
@Lightyear_87 no eye contact. Woman said it was 2p. Journos saw it
Don't forget @RT_sputnik today on @RT_com #Spanish Civil War #internationalbrigade & Hip Hop!
@lee_masterson @DavidCoburnUKip not true. I generally don't give. Never would for a camera. Wouldn't without eye contact. Never give 2pence!
The pics of Miliband today doubling back to give TWO PENCE to a beggar ( though making no eye contact) prove it. He is a f****** spaceman!
@NeilClark66 worse than that he wants to ban RT. In the interests of freedom of course...
@JeanPaulDidier Moi?

@Ejectfast @Disband_MPS nah. Better a celebrity politician than a nobody politician

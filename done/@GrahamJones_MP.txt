Delighted to vote for the biggest shake-up of pubs for centuries as 'beer tie' is scrapped meaning landlords can shop around for best deals.
@oxjustice UKIP are #SoftOnCrime unfortunately. UKIP would rather stand up for paedophiles, drug dealers, sex offenders, ppl traffickers.
@oxjustice What utter rubbish! UKIP policy = 10 years to deport av, EAW = 42 days av. Facts b4 nonsense.
Delighted to vote for the #EAW tonight. Britain should be tough on foreign criminals, ensure they're caught and deported within 90 days.

@Roversfan4ever Ive spoken w/ Clive Efford MP many x's. He's a Millwall ST holder so fully understands issues. #BRFC fans want transparency.
@Roversfan4ever We'd also legislate to give fans a first option on 10% of shares  when more than 30% of shares are being sold.
@Roversfan4ever Primary legislation recognising Supporters Trusts as a legal entity giving them a minimum of 25% (min of 2) board places.
Really pleased that the issue of internet Trolls is becoming more widely debated. Trolls lack respect, are ignorant, offensive &or bullies.

@TheLordPike 36 football league clubs (exactly half the total number of members) have gone into administration since 1992.
@TheLordPike @Roversfan4ever Germany 51% fan 'ownership' mandatory & best run clubs in Europe. Barcelona, Swansea... all successful.
So the Tories are dumping (colour) green from official leaflets in its war on 'green crap'. So much for Cameron's 'hug a huskie' rebranding.
@TheLordPike @Roversfan4ever I had the opposite view. Thought it was positive, well thought out, will have a big impact & what fans want.
@ThePejoristUK It must eventually become a cinematic blockbuster, also story about Mary Hindle & loom riots which is equally as powerful?

Interview with The Times #UKIP candidate Bickley also says he supports a small state and lower taxes. #UKCON Same values, policies & people.
Interview with The Times #UKIP candidate Bickley says he hasn’t voted Labour for decades, supporting the Tories through the Thatcher years.
#​Ukip candidate John Bickley described as “a former #Labour supporter from a council estate" admits: "I’ve been voting Tory for years".
@LilianGreenwood ..which you used to get as a monologue on an old 10inch 78 record! @alancampbellmp can almost recite of verbatim!
’Go to bed with Farage, wake up with EM’... After y'days Cameron #UKCON speech more like 'Go to bed with Cameron and end up with Farage!'
The Independent says; "extraordinary to hear these (Cameron's) promises of unfunded tax cuts, at a time when the deficit is still vast”.
Tory @TimMontgomerie (Times) welcomes Cameron's huge lurch to the right; 'Cameron is throwing the right-wing sink at the Conservative vote'.
More fantasy from Cameron. Says he's protected the NHS. RCGP's say 500+ GP's will close & y'day 'more hospitals miss cancer waiting target'.
Absolute fantasy from Cameron this morning. He's lost it. £108bn deficit still & he announces a £7.5bn unfunded tax cut to high earners...
@MichaelLCrick Well there wasn't many kippers out campaigning today. About as much activity as a hibernating hedgehog.
@UKIP & stockbroker Farage make claims to represent working class people but not one recognised Trades Union supports UKIP policies.

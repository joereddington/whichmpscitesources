@BarryHartness Tories introduced VAT and the Tories are only party to ever raise it. 'The 20% Tory Tax'. Wed Mar 25 15:37:33 GMT 2015
Nobody will believe the Tories on VAT. It's a 'Tory Tax'. Labour won't raise VAT, and under us National Insurance won't go up either. Wed Mar 25 15:17:30 GMT 2015
Tories can't explain spending plans & and claiming they'll tell electorate after the election in a spending review. Not credible. Wed Mar 25 12:46:58 GMT 2015

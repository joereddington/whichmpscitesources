@DavidWrightMP
What a commotion today. Looks like my tweets have been tinkered with. I will keep you posted
@StewartCowan yep
@StewartCowan will check out YT and get back to you. Looks like the eldest son in Bread
@StewartCowan have some memory of it now have seen w/site. Will check YouTube
@StewartCowan http://www.sledgehammeronline.com/
@StewartCowan don't remember it
@BlackrodsSheep Fair does. Apologised. Not forced, genuine
@offasreturnII Important to engage. No other Shropshire MP does
@TrippyPip think you'll find the pig is the Tory Party not Tory voters. But fair does, apology in the ether
#IvenevervotedTory because you can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig. With apologies
@offasreturnII Tory party does seem to view Britain as 'it's' country. Remember Hague's speech when leader??
@StewartCowan thanks for 1/2 point. Workers rights much improved under Labour+NHS improved. Eg cancer waiting times
@StewartCowan workers had few rights under Tories and NO minimum wage. In fact Tories oppose min wage
@TrippyPip Tory twitterers are fair game I think you'll find
@LyndaWalthoMP Funny people Tories: don't believe in NHS, education (except Eton) but do believe they have a god-given right to rule
@StewartCowan if massive investment in NHS, education, workers rights is ruining country then suggest u change wikepedia entry
@MaryxMaguire They do get very riled easily don't they. #Torybaitingforfun
@TrippyPip upsetting Tories is great fun. If you want public services slashed, education decimated and less rights at work then vote tory
@BenCooper86 so if dc gets in phil Collins is coming back to the UK. Not sure which strikes more terror inti the nations heart
@BenCooper86 Thought he left in 97? Or did he already keep Swiss time? Never can remember
Oh dear, upsetting Tories again. Must've hit a nerve
@NikDarlington @BevaniteEllie Rich people have a greater willingness to pay tax do they? Like The Lord Ashcroft?
@BevaniteEllie absolutly. They'll be demanding tax relief on school fees next - or a refund from Master Maths
@BBCLauraK Funded with Ashcroft money??
You've got to hand it dc. Attacking one "dodgy dossier" and defending another all at the same time
Think Eton maths dept need to examine their teaching methods
@Kevin_Maguire do you mean like the Marr-Tory love-in each Sunday?
@LyndaWalthoMP I agree, Sue is a great asset to Cannock and to Labour!!!!
@Daily_Ref Did you know unions ballot on political levy unlike shareholders. And what is it Bearwood Services does again?
Lansley on politics show being very agressive and negative. Not surprising after dc and coulson made him look a prat
Georgey Porgey agitated when asked on Sky News about Ashcroft. I wonder why
@wonkotsane Why don't you check?
@DodgerZulu Time off??? Don't you know there's a war on
@jiminthemorning Have you asked Mark Pritchard why he doesn't tweet? And Danny K, Owen P n Phil D
@LindaMarric I know of several people who use moonpig.com once a year so they get some val cards
JIC take note: http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/war/secret-service-has-been-trying-to-keep-things-secret%2c-says-judge-201002112461/
Remember John Smith's Social Justice commission - Tories had nothing to say then either #Toryscum
@wonkotsane How many millions has Tory party recieved in Short money?
@CorshamResident Tories in Telford council promised to get rid of PR dept. Then when got control doubled it's size
@CorshamResident Tory cuts would include nurses, teachers, road sweepers, classroom assts, doctors. Would it include council PR depts?
DC now in the centre ground? Is that what slashing public services, abanoning most vulnerable and cutting tax for richest estates means?
Looking forward to Ian Lucas visit this morning. Talking to AFC Telford and Telford Tigers about supporters trusts
@stevenradams Always the same with Tories. They demand answers from others but won't answer straight questions themselves
@stevenradams ur lot voted against funding for 2 week rule. Do u support 1 week rule? Check answer with CCHQ b4 you answer #torycensorship
@stevenradams Are your lot backing this? A new #NHS guarantee that will save up to 10,000 lives a year. http://tiny.cc/hoXZO Y or N?
@stevenradams Are your lot backing this? A new #NHS guarantee that will save up to 10,000 lives a year. http://tiny.cc/hoXZO Yes or no?
@stevenradams Resources. Well done. Docs paid for by increasing NHS funding. Ur on a roll. But you believe in slashing public spending...
@stevenradams Lord Paul. There. Now answer the question
@stevenradams 2 week rule a pointless PR exercise huh? Tell that to 000s people still alive because of it
@stevenradams Are your lot backing this? A new #NHS guarantee that will save up to 10,000 lives a year. http://tiny.cc/hoXZO
@stevenradams Suggest you consult law. All union donations democratic. Can you say same for TLA? Is he a non-Dom like Sir GP says?
Forgive me my manners. TLA
@stevenradams So Ashcroft's tax is his own business? Hmm, does Bearwood actually do owt apart from distribute LA's cash???
@stevenradams @BeavaniteEllie Read any facts stevey? £10m=a lot of leaflets in a lot of seats. Sir Georgey Porgey let cat out of the bag

@philipcmeyer @daily_ref @corshamresident @FloTom http://democracydistorted.wordpress.com/2009/12/15/non-doms-and-donations/ - paragraph 6
@andrewlomas No secret Nick Robinson is a Tory
@Sandanista A fair point
@johnprescott To be fair, he pays tax on his Dom Perignon
Just seen comparethemeercat advert. Turns out they are illegal immigrants. They would never get in under points based system
@ColinBrown09 Best let him get away with his hypocrisy then ey?
@tomcallow DC says FA about LA
Dc is simply a hypocritical vicious leader of the nasty party. Jeopardising justice while taking millions from Ashcroft #Toryscum
@Daily_Ref Pathetic. Tory party gets govt money but you have an excuse for that. Really very lame
@CorshamResident Entitled? Thought you said all tax apart from defence and police was theft. So is he getting stolen money?
@Daily_Ref And the Tory party. Short money??? Lib Dems
@Daily_Ref In the same way the Govt gives taxpayers money to the Tory party and the Lib Dems. Is that wrong too?
@CorshamResident that's just plain ignorant. Unless you are calling @wonkotsane a 'workshy layabout'. He claims Child benefit and CTF
@CorshamResident So no NHS, no education, no Child Benefit, no roads, no rail network, etc etc etc etc
@Daily_Ref if you want no rights at work, then vote Tory. If you think workers should be protected, vote Labour. Pretty simple
@Daily_Ref Oh dear, there there. Your question was based on a false allegation. My answer was based on fact
@Daily_Ref Your question was based on a false allegation. My answer was based on fact
@Daily_Ref RT Most libertarians (definitionally) uphold freedom to evade taxes since taxation to them is theft. Selfish, ignorant but Tory.
@Daily_Ref I am extremely happy that the political fund of affiliated unions is democratic and used to further to rights of working people
@Daily_Ref Let me get this straight, you, Tory activist, are happy about a Belise-based Lord who won't clarify tax status, funding Tories?
@Daily_Ref Why won't you answer my question? It is simple enough even for a right-winger
@Daily_Ref Simple question: Are you comfortable with a Belise based Lord who won't come clean about his tax status funding Tories? too hard?
@CorshamResident Simple question: Are you comfortable with a Belise based Lord who won't come clean about his tax status funding Tories?
@Daily_Ref Simple question: Are comfortable with a Belise based Lord who won't come clean about his tax status funding Tories?
@CorshamResident So, Libertarian, are comfortable with a Belise based Lord who won't come clean about his tax status funding Tories?
@CorshamResident But still not answering the question
If it was a stupid question it was designed to match the intellect of your average Tory
@Daily_Ref Even if you won't admit you are wrong on anything else, you have got to admit Ashcroft is an embarrassment to Tory Party. no?
@Daily_Ref You are comfortable with a Belise based Lord who won't come clean about his tax status funding Tories are you?
@Daily_Ref Resorting to personal abuse. Oh dear, losing the argument?
@CorshamResident Well little Tory boy, I asked first
@CorshamResident @Daily_Ref I am surprised that if what you say is true and Ashcroft 'only' gives 2% of Tory funding they don't ditch him
@Daily_Ref Union political funding is democratic. Presume Ashcroft holds a ballot on his political funding in his Belise home
@CorshamResident But as usual my little Tory chum, you didn't answer the question
@Daily_Ref Cameron attacks Labour on expenses but fails to explain why Belise-based non-dom goes on trips with Hague to meet Foreign Govts
@Daily_Ref @CorshamResident WHAT ABOUT ASHCROFT????
DC says the Tories are "at ease with openness". WHAT ABOUT ASHCROFT????
Just saw article on Daily politics re emotion. Utter crap 'journalism'
If DC so in favour of change why is he archaic on voting system? On economics he wants Thatcherism. Did he write Lamonts press conf lines?
@DianaJohnsonMP Welcome back
Georgey Porgey's plans would mean taking child tax credits away from couples earning over £16,000 per year
#sarcasm - forgot
If it's in the News of the World, it must be true
@wonkotsane Check your tweets stuey
@wonkotsane World beware: disagreeing with Stuart Parr is now classified (by S Parr) as intimidation. You can do better than that stu
@wonkotsane Ahhh, because someone dares to challenge your false allegations. You carry on, I just think it's sad u have to make stuff up
Has anyone else noticed pro-Enlish Parl lot are both for cutting taxes and for spending millions on new layer of Govt?
@BevaniteEllie Your words inspired me
Vague and Alan Johnson's performances on #Marr shows gulf between Labour & Tories
@wonkotsane You made a specific allegation. As you always do when losing the argument. Sad really
Seems @wonkotsan. Has gone quiet. Guess he is trying to delete false allegations to avoid court
@wonkotsane Where is your proof?
Prove your allegation. Can you?
@wonkotsane Prove your allegation about unions. Have screen grab. Debate is one thing. Making false allegations quite another
@wonkotsane For working people via their unions to campaign for greater rights at work? Yes, I do. I presume u want less rights at ur work
@wonkotsane You made an allegation about unions. Sure their lawyers will be interested in that
@wonkotsane You think it is ok for a Belise based non-dom to run Tory policy, buy marginal seats and fund Hagues global trips! I don't
@wonkotsane Prove it. Serious allegation you are making Stuart
@wonkotsane Unions ballot on use of political fund. Can you say same of your mate ashcroft or companies use of shareholders money???
@wonkotsane All money comes from union's political fund is money paid in by members, all donations transparent. You defending Ashcroft cash
@wonkotsane You only exposed your support for the Ashcroft style of running politics. Unions spending is democratic and transparent
@MaryxMaguire I know. It is right wing usual suspects trying to claim unions as bad as Ashcroft & Tories. Is utter rubbish
@StewartCowan Your point about me?
@wonkotsane I for one am comfortable democratic unions that rep. working people support Lab. Scandal rich nontaxpayer controls Tory policy
Taxpayers money donated to unions to give to Lab Party? Proof please
@wonkotsane Presumably then you think Ashcroft buying marginal seats is a good thing????
@StewartCowan Your point?
@wonkotsane Unions have political ballots. Unlike companies and Ashcroft millions they are democratic
Vague just shows Tories have lots to hide about Ashcroft. Nothing to hide? Why not be honest? PM right - is a scandal! http://bit.ly/brmf6d
@ChrisBryantMP Ho Ho Ho
Great result for England. Good performance

@SammyDolton Maybe it's the guy who plays with that band...? Oops, wrong Ashcroft. Not nearly as wealthy
@danjwilkinson Can you email me details pls and I will look into it
@SammyDolton Perhaps she could ask him about his tax status???
Busy constituency day today. Meetings and two advice surgeries. See www.davidwrightmp.org.uk for details
A thousand followers. Honoured! Thanks to you and you and you etc.
Tories promise education spending cuts in Telford
Maybe Pickles would have a wee bit of credibility if the Tories came clean about Ashcroft's millions and his tax status
@P13lch Well done. You are a good man
Grayling slammed as "profoundly misleading" by IDS! http://bit.ly/cjeBe1

The row over Tory crime statistics deepens
@TelfordWrekin Only 1 day left to respond: http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/secondment#incoming-63698
Think Beeb need to update their Poll Tracker - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm
@MirrorJames Wonder why Georgey Porgey wouldn't want a tough question? Perhaps because Tory economic policy set to change before midday?

@bigdaddymerk You get the Shrop Star to criticise T&W council now they are Tory run I will buy you a pint. Patsies!
@BevaniteEllie Absolutely. Just shows how little dc, vague and georgey porgey understand the real world
@bigdaddymerk How many £millions? if I ask usual suspects accuse me of opportunism exposing T&W wasting £m's. Maybe you should ask an FoI?
@BevaniteEllie Not in the bag though. We have to continue to make the case for a progressive future
@bigdaddymerk It is great int it. One of the best restaurants in Telford

@simoncast OK, you obviously know more about this than I. What do you think should be the solution?
@DodgerZulu Quite. If there's nothing to hide why not end the speculation? And what about Cuba with Hague???
@simoncast hear what ur saying. Heard of Amazon setting price too low for authors to make anything. Perhaps whole system needs looking at?
@Tarbert59 It is horrible. No one at the council seemed to notice it snowing overnight
@simoncast Is it publishers or dominance of 1 or 2 retailers? Not 1st time Amazon have delisted a publisher
"There are plenty of people like me, who would like to die when the time comes to die" - Sir Terry Pratchett. What do people think?
@Tarbert59 Doing the economic hokey coke-y with Hague and Georgey Porgey
@greglovelluk dc, Vague and Georgey Porgey are just showing how lightweight they are
I don't believe there is any desire to go back to 1980s and massive public sector cuts http://bit.ly/b1fDuy - Tories in turmoil!!!!
Anyone know who this is? http://bit.ly/9Nwpag
@Kevin_Maguire They are laughing in voters faces. It stinks
Seems to me Ashcroft, dc and Hague assume they have won and can do what they like: http://bit.ly/aZDpxz
Are council press offices - funded by council tax payers - allowed to be overtly party political?
@tchee Royston Branch: get on
@TelfordWrekin Cllr Tonks quoted in Dawley Social Club story. Has he joined Tory group? Not ward member and did nothing to sort lease
@wonkotsane To be clear then. You don't claim Child Benefit and don't claim Child Trust Fund?
@wonkotsane Suggest you check your tweets
@wonkotsane you made a false allegation and you know it
@wonkotsane I think you should check your facts before making false accusations
@wonkotsane I have already answered at the time. All open and nothing to hide. Check register for FACTS
@wonkotsane An interesting slant. You say NHS underfunded but that Govt spending should be slashed. Square peg and round hole
@wonkotsane To be clear then. You don't claim Child Benefit and don't claim Child Trust Fund? Is that correct?
@wonkotsane So, tax credits: tick. Child Trust Fund?
@wonkotsane curious: u claim Tax Credits? Increased Ch/Benefit? Child Trust Fund? Use education or NHS? All improved by Govt ur so against
@wonkotsane I have nothing to hide
@wonkotsane I suggest you check your facts
@CHazelgrove Spent 5 hours on it today. A more exciting Thursday I could not have imagined
@wonkotsane What are you on about?
No wonder local papers are failing when they become mouthpiece for local council press office. People want news not biased copy & pasting
Story in Journal today re Dawley Social Club utter rubbish. Tonks had nothing to do with it. My staff sorted it. No praise for them tho
@roybroad It's a shame other Shroshire MPs can't be persuaded on here as well. Debate really important even with those you disagree with
@chrisevans Lollipop ladies on the A449 into Wolverhampton taking car to be serviced. Great to see
@MichaelWhite Willy wants it all ways
So Willy disagreed withVAT being cut and now he disagrees with it going back to previous level. Come on Willy, make your mind up
Georgey Porgey looks like he is holding in a big fart
No country more exposed??? What about Iceland?
@wonkotsane Always lag between end of recession & that being felt everywhere just as lag between qtr figures relate to and their release!
@wonkotsane Glad you clarified that. I thought we were back in the 1930s
@Kevin_Maguire Tell him you are from the SNP
@wonkotsane So based on little Englander logic: no one notices start of recession, no one notices end - therefore we are always in recession
@wonkotsane and since when did 6 quarters make 'a couple of years'?
@wonkotsane quite the opposite. Your understanding of economics and history very wonky. See graph in various papers today
Out of recession and Nick Robinson says they are bad economic figures. Is he DC's stooge or what?
@wonkotsane idiotic replies. Oh well, your views I suppose. Thankfully those whose jobs saved by govt intervention don't agree
Also, simple understanding of Keynesianism shows Govt intervention DOES work. Eg. Car Scrappage scheme
@wonkotsane That is simply rubbish. Records only began in 1945 and this has not been as bad as 30s Great Depression
@wonkotsane So you would rather Govt left economy to market forces like in 1980s and 90s?
@wonkotsane How do you think things get paid for?
@wonkotsane ... NHS investment, schools investment, more rights at work, maternity leave, paternity leave...
@wonkotsane Yes, let's ignore minimum wage, tax credits, winter fuel allowance, increased Child Benefit, Child Trust Funds etc. etc. etc
@ashleytmason Some say scrappage scheme, some say fiscal stimulus, others argue Eric Pickles & services to pie industry. I couldn't comment
@daisymcandrew This is the same scrappage scheme the Tories opposed and thought we should not have had??!!??
Trying in vain to find DC, Georgey Porgey or Hague saying good news UK emerging from recession. Can anyone help?
Nick Robinson on R4. Anyone he would think he was a Tory...
Survey of social attitudes suggests people in the UK are becoming increasingly liberal. Shove that in your pipe DC
While the nation hopes for good GDP figures the Tories pray for doom. Georgey Porgey, dc and hague will be up all night doing a rain dance

@BevaniteEllie absolutely. Economic migration has made the world more successful. Biggest diaspora?????
@FloTom utter crap. Think you will find minimum wage, WFTC, NHS investment, BSF, etc is non discriminatory
@ashleytmason who do you follow? As polls close and country sees horror of what Tory govt would mean I want to see their angst
@SallyBercow www.toriesareniceandcuddlyreally.com ???
Argument that a good reason for a Tory Govt is that there are still disadvantaged in society is utter HS. Only Labour helps most vulnerable

opportunist AND tricking police. Disgraceful http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/
@vincentmoss Are poll details online anywhere yet? Promise to buy paper tomorrow too
@ToryatSea quite. Still a stronger argument than you seem to be mounting in defence of the OT
@ToryatSea pathetic
@ToryatSea no, but complaining about language is a diversion tactic instead of addressing dc's sick opportunism
@ToryatSea opportunist leaders of the opposition are an indication of desperation and a sickness at heart of Tory party
@ToryatSea oh and apologies for telling it like it is. Cameron IS an opportunist tosser. Or should I have said the Rt Hon gentleman?
@ToryatSea The actions of two vile young people do not represent the actions of a nation and it is wrong to suggest otherwise
@goldenscan The actions of two vile young people do not represent the actions of a nation and it is wrong to suggest otherwise
@ToryatSea and sadly your selective copy n paste didn't manage the whole quote
@ToryatSea oh dear, my apologies for telling it like it is
DC trying to make political capital out of tragic case in Edlington is nothing short of disgusting
@BevaniteEllie I think it's best in the long run
@Sambo119 you choose a more approriate word
@BevaniteEllie quite. Dc is a horrible opportunistic scumbag
@KerryMP dc is an opportunist tosser. It is just offensive that he used this tragedy to score political points
@bigdaddymerk They just print what he or council press office tell them to. Same with Star. Glad you got letter

@bigdaddymerk Yes, received and I'm making some enquiries
I see Georgey Porgey is back at DC's side. Is Hague away?
@TelfordWrekin is there a single Tory councillor on Twitter?
@TelfordWrekin Disgraceful behaviour from T&W council leader. He used to bleat about council arrogance - now he introduces it as policy
@MikeOBrienMP Some people are just unbelievable
Disgraceful behaviour from T&W council leader. He used to bleat about council arrogance - now he introduces it as policy
@BevaniteEllie as long as the scumbags stay in the shadow I'll be happy
@BevaniteEllie There aren't any Tory cabinet ministers and long may that continue
@Sambo119 There aren't any Tory cabinet ministers and long may that continue
@wonkotsane The £200m seperate to block grant. Nothing to do with C-tax. Extra investment in Telford. See what DK says in Shrewsbury
Oops DC. Looks like another FU: http://waugh.standard.co.uk/2010/01/carol-vorderman-barred-by-the-tories.html
@wonkotsane £200 million of which is for Telford!!!!
@MirrorJames Having voted against funding for school rebuilding. Some might say he is a hypocrit
@tscholesfogg to make the most cash from serialisation. A true servant of the people who rely on a min wage, NHS etc that Tories would cut
Think Greg Hands should look at the lord Ashcroft's millions before he goes throwing stones
@Tarbert59 who?
@wonkotsane £200m is the Building Schools for the Future money the Govt decided to invest in Telford's education

@wonkotsane So you presumably think the country should have been left to it in the recession instead of the Govt fiscal stimulus
@wonkotsane Been on holiday have you?
@Kevin_Maguire Clegg 2??? Presume he got 1 for turning up and 1 for asking a question no matter how ridiculous...

@charliewhelan do tell...
Hear the Ausralian Foreign Minister is shite at Articulate. Think DM should challenge a game
@wonkotsane Your opinion. Not the truth. PBR was hardly electioneering
@wonkotsane you are wrong. Education and the NHS are our top priorities as they should be. You supports cuts in frontline services I don't
@wonkotsane So you want to see cuts in education. At least you are clear about that. I do not and I am clear about that. What about Tories?
@wonkotsane ah, the economic naiivity of the unreconstructed Thatcherite. If we don't invest in education we will be the poorer for it
@wonkotsane Building Schools for the Future. T&W Council has recieved £200 million
@wonkotsane Never have answers??? £200m of investment in BSF in Telford is UK Labour Govt deciding to prioritise Telford. That clear enough?
@wonkotsane maintain education spending in Telford. Labour has given a clear committment to no cuts in education
@wonkotsane oh, that makes it perfectly ok then
Shrewsbury MPs argument essentially: get a Tory Govt & funding for Telford education - most deprived areas in Shropshire - gets cut
@wonkotsane "changes too" ?? So you want funding for Telford kids cut??!!??
Danny K says Telford kids get more funding than Shropshire kids but if there was a Tory Govt that would change
He's writing for Dr Who, poetry and trying to get Phil Collins back on the hair restorer. Good man

@SamuelCoates so why did they oppose it when we introduced it?
@DannyLee123 saying what I think. Presume that is ok with you??
@KerryMP I am not uncommitted to watching the entire 5th series of Bagpus goes to Torytown. Does that make committed to it?
@SamuelCoates perhaps you could point us to where this committment is set in stone - or is it just that dc 'hopes' to be committed to it?
@BBCNewsnight Pathetic attempt to keep the story going
Back to Telford tonight. Advice surgeries tomorrow for 4 hrs. Stirchley and St Georges
@MaryxMaguire Quite. TU members have political levy ballot. No shareholder ballot on political donations and no word on Ashcroft
@CllrShaunDavies you have one guess only...
@SaveEMA if dc is so committed to EMAs why did he oppose them?
@Tarbert59 and get openly balloted on political levy
Hear Tories planning to attack Labour over union support. They should come clean on their secret billionaires tax status' 1st
@Tarbert59 True. Especially around GP surgeries
@stefanstern True. Well, it was. Prats
Poss worst tweet of 2010: Our cat couldn't get out this morning for his toilet business. His cat flap was frozen so he used the litter tray
@Stefanstern Not quite what he actually SAID
@Tarbert59 True. Paxo would do better a little less incredulous at everything anyone says. Arrogance at it's most magnificent
Paxman is a sneering tosser sometimes. Was clear straightaway Peter M got better of him
@DodgerZulu Well said. We should be concentrating on the needs of the country not the navel gazing of a few has beens
@Tarbert59 jog along
@RuthBarnett Well said. H&H an irrelevant distraction to needs of country
@wonkotsane pity ur entrenched views don't extend to criticising TPA. Gift Aid supposed to support legit charities not Tory party research
Gordon on good form. Not surprised really. Tories have no idea about Govt and their policies don't bear scrutiny
Pathetic from cameron
@wonkotsane Now, I am still waiting for your condemnation of TPA over abuse of Gift Aid...
@wonkotsane eg. http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/dec/15/guardian-icm-poll-climate-change-problem
Answers: no, we do, inference, no, explain, other polls differ, will read it
@Erica_Jane_MP hear what ur saying but we also have duty to disect opposition proposals. Public need all facts about both sides policies
@PlymouthLabour link doesn't work
@wonkotsane will reply on here. Go on...
@Erica_Jane_MP ok so the language might be yaboo but the fact is every time the Tories dare launch a policy it unravels
Radio 5. Expert says Tories claim on gas storage misleading
Day 2 and Tory policy no. 2 unravels. At this rate their manifesto will be blank save for tax cuts for richest estates
@tomwilliamsisme This one is! They could hold it anywhere else. Offensive and insensitive
In 12 yrs our local hospital has retained full services despite 6 yrs of Tory MP scaremongering. Will dc commit to Telford as GB has?
Still, at least Robbo is scrutinising them. Makes a change for media to question Tory policy. And as soon as they do policy disintegrates
Esther bloody ransom on TV. Turned over. I trust advertising revenue suffered
Does dc mean he would cut RSH and move services to PRH? We need specifics otherwise empty words
Well done BBC Shropshire for keeping everyone updated throughout the day. My thoughts with injured and their families
Well done Leeds. Even beating Fergie time
Osborne the weakest link? Does dc have ANY intention of him being chancellor if horror of horrors Tories win? Or is there a secret agenda?

Final Gavin and Stacey. Gutted
@maxatkinson and happy new year to you
@ wonkotsane cheers. No need to always agree. Debate most important thing. Happy new year
@JuicyJulesRocks delighted to become number 700. I need 2 more for 800
@maxatkinson Here's an idea: if u don't want to hear what PM of our country has to say, don't listen. Most people do even if they disagree
@wonkotsane You say it is fraudulent, I disagree and the vast majority do too
So the millions who use the NHS every year are fools are they Hannan? What a prat
My sincere condolences to David Taylor's family. He was a true servant of the people of Leicestershire and will be greately missed

@wonkotsane Thanks. Appreciated!!
@jshawmiller but then you do live in Surrey. Ho ho ho
@wokotsane going to slag the council press office are you? Hmm probably not. Sad
@jshawmiller oh, I misunderstood - thought it would be a GOOD think us having a do in Telford. you know, supporting local businesses
@ jshawmiller will be later jockey
David Wright and staff spotted having Christmas do in TELFORD
@CllrShaunDavies Do they know it's Christmas time? NO. How come Williams didn't mention he loves Dawley so much he moved to Bratton?
@CllrShaunDavies Well done. Hopefully all sides will back you. If they don't then they need exposing
@timwhale MPs paying money back. Presumably TPA will be paying back all the Gift Aid it abused???
Guardian: "director of [taxpayers] alliance, Alexander Heath, does not pay British tax and lives in France" If this true then it stinks!!
@wonkotsane So, ok for taxpayers alliance to abuse taxpayers is it? The world of Twitter is awaiting your condemnation of them...

@TelfordWrekin Can't believe Telford council PR dept not supporting local restaurants
Horrific and deeply offensive letter in Star from Shrewsbury MP. Thankfully Govt ignoring him
Finally had reply from T&W council. Well, I say reply. More like political rant based in fairyland rather than factual
@wonkotsane You think the Tories would have spent £200 MILLION on Telford schools if they were Govt? Labour investment choice!!
@wonkotsane I don't have the figures to hand but if you email via my website, I can certainly ask the council for them for you
Evans - pathetic reposte
DC and Hague - The Brothers Grim - loving that
BSF funds - £200million for Telford. Funny how the council won't acknowledge this is Labour Govt investment
@FloTom So you think it's OK to have non-doms and non-UK tax payers in Parliament? I don't

Hmm, make a judgement: http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/dec/10/david-cameron-mps-expenses1
Wondering whether lack answer from Telford council is incompetance or political
@roybroad Workforce at Donnington excellent though+knowledge+comittment. If you have specifics in mind please do let me know via my website

So come on Georgey Porgey what would you cut? What would you match? Some policies please
@CllrShaunDavies Why won't they come clean about it?

Pickles said Ashcroft would go on Today prog to answer questions on tax - he refused. Come on dc - who's in charge?
@TelfordWrekin why does council pretend all good things their idea and bad things Govts?
@wonkotsane so you keep saying. Only thing is that's not the case at all
Has anyone else been getting rubbish service from Demon broadband or is it just my constituency?
Still waiting for honesty from T&W Council on why Council Tax increase only 1.9%. Should not even be that! Govt grant increase was 4.7%!!
Excellent article by Polly Toynbee in today's guardian
Poor dc. Petty and spiteful to point out the Tories are a bunch of toffs or just plain true!!!

Meeting with Andy Burnham tomorrow afternoon to discuss PRH
@wonkotsane No, nothing. You might have noticed - Tories have been running the council for nearly 3 years now
There is no excuse for Council Tax increase OR service cuts in Telford & Wrekin. 4.9% increase from central Govt. No excuses!!
Breaking News: Telford & Wrekin Council set to acknowledge Labour Govt investment in Telford means low Council Tax increase... more soon
just what planet is Zac G on?
This is a fantastic place: http://www.quayhousetarbert.co.uk
@TelfordWrekin Because Govt grant up 4.7%. Presumably T&W Council will acknowledge Lab Govt investment in Telford??? Not holding out hope

@bigdaddymerk I disagree. Telford the growing town and growing in the future. Services should be concentrated here. Especially paeds & A&E
@bigdaddymerk over 4000 Telford people - so far - have had enough of being treated as second class to Shrewsbury
@wonkotsane @bigdaddymerk My position crystal clear. I stand up 4 the people of Telford & not deterred by personal insults from Stuart Parr
@wonkotsane I think you will find it is Stuart. Telford is the growing town, not Shrewsbury
@wonkotsane Assume ur asking all MPs same. Perhaps u would've preferred I hadn't attended on behalf of Telford so u could criticise for that
Well at least he knows they are a bunch of lightweights: http://bit.ly/3n45Dw
DC delivers policy free speech. Believes they can win with expensive campaign and an easy ride from the media. Where's the beef Dave?
Still an overwhelming response to campaign. Another 300 replies today. Health bosses need to take note of this level of support for the PRH
@wonkotsane The best thing for Telford is that health services reflect a young and growing population
@chrispallett The message is crystal clear: NO to the movement of health services from Telford to Shrewsbury
Fears raised over health travel http://bit.ly/4geXkD
@chrispallett I am happy to work with Shropshire but not for Telford to be treated as second class. I make no apology for that standpoint
@wonkotsane Thats ur view. Mine is that services should be retained at least but hopefully expanded at PRH - Telford is the growing town!
@wonkotsane Stuart, I stand up for Telford. Perhaps you should ask Wrekin & Shrewsbury MPs to reconcile their opposing positions on services

@wonkotsane No money for NHS since 1997. Waiting times up, investment down, less nurses, less doctors. My mistake, that's your Tory future
@viperdudeuk Great photo though. "Kenneth Clarke, you are the weakest link on Europe. Goodbye"
@Simon_G_1 So tell us all. Hannan wants UK out of Europe and the end of NHS. Cameron should tell us if he agrees
@jshawmiller It is about putting Telford people first. We have been treated as 2nd class for too long by Shrewsbury based health managers
@bigdaddymerk @ravenatic @wonkotsane Labour massively increased investment in the NHS but it is not bottomless. Telford must be the priority
@wonkotsane You have a simple choice Stuart: Whose side are you on? Telford or Shrewsbury. I make no apology for standing up for Telford
@Simon_G_1 I guess you know who is deciding Tory policy. Is it Hannan or Cameron. Prey tell

3400 visitors to http://www.saynotoshrewsbury.com in first week. Anger at any proposals to downgrade PRH services is widespread
@AlexConnor Nothing against Shrewsbury. Everything against moving health services from Telford to Shrewsbury!!
Good news: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8283150.stm Leaving a tip in future will reward good service not subsidise employers
So the sun is going back to it's roots - backing a bunch of toffs who would decimate public services and the NHS. What a surprise
Beautiful day in Brighton. Great day for Gordon's fightback to continue by exposing the Tories for what they are
Great speech John Denham. Tory councils claim credit 4 Labour investment are dishonest. What'll they do when Cameron cuts that investment?
Fantastic news. Over 2000 signatures on say NO to Shrewsbury already
Having a cup of tea in the PLP office after excellent speech from Lord Mandelson

Well done Andrew Rawnsley. Politicshome was objective new media. Now a tax exile's mouthpiece: http://bit.ly/OxaSQ

How strange that Daniel Hannan's latest right wing claptrap hasn't been condemned by Cameron. Anyone would think Dave agrees with his fave

Excellent video from David Mitchell: http://bit.ly/sJL2b
@viperdudeuk Everyone knows Tories don't believe in the NHS. All Hannan did was let the cat out of the bag
What is Cameron going to DO about Hannan? Is he going to discipline him?
Great news: http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8201389.stm
#welovethenhs Has anyone else noticed that Cameron never condemns Dave's Faves? No wonder when Hannan was number 1 on the MEP list
#welovethenhs Is Cameron going to condemn the crazy words of Tory MEP Daniel Hannan?
I wonder if Alan Duncan would have kept his position if he wasn't one of Dave's faves
#welovetheNHS NHS is great example of society working together for a greater good. R-wing Americans call it Socialism I call it common sense
The scare tactics of US right-wing are a disgrace. NHS is a great service to our country. I only hope Americans see through the lies

New Speaker was excellent in his first session at PMQs. I am confident he will improve the image of the House of Commons
@Madeley1 No he wasn't. He was pushed up in the scrum continuously and the ref failed to deal with it
Great move putting Vickery back on. He didn't deserve the criticism after Saturday
@OxfordSpring I agree. Can't hold Speaker to ransom on change of Govt if he delivers. Need for continuity and fairness
@AMAPLtd I did ask :-) Taken on board!!
@abelardinelli How are you young man? Long time no hear
@chrispallett @AMAPLtd @OxfordSpring @timbailey Interesting comments re. Speaker process. What about Speaker Bercow?
What do you think the new Speaker has to do to re-connect the House of Commons with the public?
Feels like we are living through history electing a Speaker for Parliament
@andyhamflett Thanks Andy. I think it's fixed now

Real privilege to lay wreath with govt @ Cenotaph on #Gallipoli100 & mark #AnzacDay in Westminster Abbey esp as grandpa was Gallipoli vet. Sat Apr 25 15:23:20 BST 2015
Crikey - I accept the BBC has an 'agenda' but the pro Tessa Munt Lib Dem puff piece they've just put out takes the biscuit! Shocking. Fri Apr 24 18:45:38 BST 2015

Vacuous, tasteless attempt by Ed Miliband to exploit Med migrant crisis in pop at UK Libya role. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Ed's #JustNotUpToIt Fri Apr 24 09:03:19 BST 2015
Really proud of our country's contribution to public health fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone. Lasting legacy. Thu Apr 23 18:48:19 BST 2015

Nicola Sturgeon's 'hand of friendship' reaching out to grasp UK by the neck opportunistically exposed by Ed Miliband. #VoteConservative Mon Apr 20 17:06:47 BST 2015
Interesting poll shift. Sunny economic news or Lab/SNP? Don't know but Red Ed & SNP being raised +++ on doorstep here. #VoteConservative Mon Apr 20 16:37:12 BST 2015
Mounting prospect of v left Lab/SNP govt with tax, borrow, spend agenda & separatist, rabidly pro EU twist. Wonder why no Lab support here? Mon Apr 20 15:57:05 BST 2015
Come clean Clegg - west country voters want to know - will Lib Dem MPs prop up very leftist Miliband/SNP? Sun Apr 19 10:11:59 BST 2015

Great #GE2015 debate tonight at Trowbridge Town Hall convened by Yerbury St Residents Association. Wide range of issues covered. Fri Apr 17 22:07:48 BST 2015

Clear who'd wear the trousers in Lab/SNP deal - not @Ed_Miliband. Pulped by Ms Sturgeon in #BBCDebate chamber of horrors. #JustNotUpToIt Thu Apr 16 21:30:48 BST 2015
@Ed_Miliband losing it again on NHS #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:11:33 BST 2015
Ooops! Farage insults BBC (fair enough) then studio audience (not good). Now being deconstructed by Ms Sturgeon. Liking this. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:39:27 BST 2015
Well now, Mr Miliband talking the talk on NHS but won't back it with cash. Hot air never cured anyone. #BBCDebate #VoteConservative Thu Apr 16 20:22:14 BST 2015
My reflections on yesterday's outrageous Lib Dem hubris have made Daily Mail tweet of the day. Fame at last. Thu Apr 16 20:10:38 BST 2015
Just done pre-record for BBC Wiltshire with other candidates in Trowbridge. Similar reach as contenders' debate tonight? Possibly not. Thu Apr 16 19:53:42 BST 2015
Looking forward to @Ed_Miliband coming clean on what kind of deal  he would do with SNP in #ChallengersDebate 
#VoteConservative Wed Apr 15 21:46:37 BST 2015
As Clegg's about to lose his seat, has LD stuff on stopping lurch to 'extremes' been cleared with likely successor, leftie Tim Farron? Wed Apr 15 16:35:58 BST 2015
Pious Lib Dems saying they'll be Labour's brain or Conservatives' heart. Ha! There's a less decorous bit of anatomy to describe this. Wed Apr 15 16:01:10 BST 2015
@Conservatives manifesto has business rates relief for local papers - hopefully good news for hard pressed WT, WJ, WHN, BVM & Valley News? Tue Apr 14 14:56:29 BST 2015

In Swindon where PM launching manifesto. Right to buy, childcare, cutting income tax on low paid, more NHS cash than Labour. Brilliant! Tue Apr 14 11:29:42 BST 2015
Its official - Labour will borrow even more. Ed & Alex will be sweating the credit card. Our children'll pick up the tab. Mon Apr 13 21:42:54 BST 2015
Don't want to sound negative or anything but isn't it a but odd Labour pretending its the party of prudence given it crashed the economy? Mon Apr 13 18:18:07 BST 2015

Nigel Farage saying #VoteConservative where UKIP can't win. Otherwise it's a vote for Lab/SNP, Ed & Alex & everything UKIPers don't want Mon Apr 13 08:41:59 BST 2015
LOL @ Ed Miliband's rant on tax avoidance. Silent on 13 years of Labour govt. What about Ed's Deed of Variation stunt? But, but, but.... Sun Apr 12 11:49:39 BST 2015
Strong growth means we can spend £8BN more on #NHS making it even better. Not poss with Miliband/Salmond economics. Sun Apr 12 11:30:08 BST 2015
Great news on £8BN NHS spending uplift. Dividend of a restored economy from a party that understands healthcare. #VoteConservative Sat Apr 11 08:24:04 BST 2015
@jackieadams2412 you ask if I'd close down non dom. Balls argued no in Jan, ditto Labour in office because of cost.  Now says yes. Costly. Fri Apr 10 08:09:16 BST 2015
Really pleased to see much of the A350 looking clean and litter free again - not just my adopted lay-by! #KeepBritainTidy Thu Apr 09 16:45:50 BST 2015
@jackieadams2412 Ed Balls in Jan said no and it was no for 13 years presumably 'cos it would cost. Chaos! Wed Apr 08 22:08:49 BST 2015

Or put another away, Scottish oil receipts fluctuated from 2.4% to 8.3% of Scottish GDP: UK absorbs that more easily #ScotDecides #indyref
Since devolution Scottish share of North Sea oil and gas receipts has fluctuated between £2 billion and £12 billion #ScotDecides #indyref

Govt awards regional ITV news contract to a consortium with little previous connection to the Borders Not obvious this is a step forward...
@gayle81 Yes!
If this was a 'Class war' Budget, as some in Labour boast, why did the Chancellor choose to attack people on the lowest incomes?!

@beeflin no & I think all Parties should back the NHS's own long term plan, the 5YFV & pledge to fully fund it Mon Apr 27 18:37:51 BST 2015

@ElliotBidgood it hasn't 'killed democracy' in Germany. Arguably last coalition combined had greater percentage of votes than previous govts Sun Apr 26 19:28:39 BST 2015
@ir_1008 and to you too Sun Apr 26 16:32:25 BST 2015
@ir_1008 @montie as am I , just feel we need to be clear with voters what the process will be if that does not happen Sun Apr 26 16:28:15 BST 2015
@d_mcmenemy I think there is a danger in the rise of the ugly side of nationalism wherever that arises Sun Apr 26 16:19:22 BST 2015
No Governments, Parties or MPs have ever been 'loved' & never will be but our tolerant democracy is far far better than the alternatives Sun Apr 26 16:14:39 BST 2015
@nickfraser in a referendum the country voted to keep it; politicians shd accept that result & work constructively within it Sun Apr 26 16:04:57 BST 2015
@peterthurlow far better & in national interest for Parties to set out how they would be constructive rather than destructive Sun Apr 26 15:59:46 BST 2015
Last time around, in effect only a tiny number of people wrote a manifesto no one had voted upon. We shd all know who would do so this time Sun Apr 26 15:52:12 BST 2015
Polling points to no outright winner; Parties should stop posturing as voters need to know how they would go about constructive negotiations Sun Apr 26 15:50:23 BST 2015
@cpsoper those who tell other married couples that theirs isn't a true marriage & don't count. What other word would you use for C4M insults Sun Apr 26 14:54:16 BST 2015
@montie my sense is that people are tired of all the posturing about who won't work with who. If voters return a dead heat, why not? Sun Apr 26 13:11:48 BST 2015
Grand coalition hasn't exactly been a disaster for Germany. What's so dreadful about loosening our rigid tribal approach to politics? Sun Apr 26 13:04:15 BST 2015

@OliveBrchFound I call people who drop offensive leaflets to same sex couples telling them theirs isn't 'true marriage' bigots Tue Apr 21 21:53:51 BST 2015
@scary_biscuits @timothy_stanley its irrelevant to my calling out C4M for its bigoted and nasty little leaflet Tue Apr 21 18:34:33 BST 2015
@thearkpage that was what my tweet was about and what C4M in effect delivered across my area Tue Apr 21 18:33:45 BST 2015
@scary_biscuits @timothy_stanley my tweet was clearly referring to C4M & yes, their leaflet is highly offensive to same sex married couples Tue Apr 21 18:28:41 BST 2015
.@thearkpage but would you post a leaflet through a same sex couple's door telling them theirs isn't a 'true marriage'? That is name calling Tue Apr 21 18:26:40 BST 2015

No, @TheAgedP @bernerlap I don't think it's ok to insult married same sex couples by telling them theirs isn't a 'true' marriage! Mon Apr 20 23:26:49 BST 2015

@fizzygal61  bigger mistake to churn it all over again and hand commissioning to LAs. Better to fund & back the NHS's own long term plan Sun Apr 19 23:15:25 BST 2015

All evidence submitted to @CommonsHealth public expenditure inquiry, both oral & written, is published on the committee website Thu Mar 12 15:02:13 GMT 2015
My preference was clearly to try to agree & to publish a report on public expenditure. A majority voted not to do so Thu Mar 12 14:59:49 GMT 2015

@DucdeVoltaire @Nigel_Farage @UKIP it's been debated & today every single MP had a vote Wed Mar 11 16:51:02 GMT 2015
So looks like @UKIP haven't decided their latest 'back of fag packet' policy on whether to restore fag packet adverts for big tobacco Wed Mar 11 16:45:37 GMT 2015
.@Nigel_Farage team big tobacco have had their say & lost the vote today in Parliament, I believe in democracy. Will @UKIP restore cig ads? Wed Mar 11 16:41:57 GMT 2015
.@Nigel_Farage Serious question; would @UKIP bring back tobacco advertising on fag packets &/or elsewhere? Wed Mar 11 16:30:56 GMT 2015
@Nigel_Farage my question was; will you call on big tobacco not to waste taxpayers money by taking legal action against the govt? Wed Mar 11 16:21:12 GMT 2015
@Nigel_Farage there is nothing in this which stops you smoking Nigel but it ends the last legal form of deceitful advertising to new addicts Wed Mar 11 16:17:17 GMT 2015
.@Nigel_Farage as opposed to @UKIP support for big tobacco, which kills half its long term customers. Will you support them suing UK govt? Wed Mar 11 16:08:26 GMT 2015

@DamianAStuart @BenCooper86 not one person, I actively sought views in a number of fora. Sat Mar 07 09:12:41 GMT 2015
@BenCooper86 @DamianAStuart thank you Ben. It's clear to me that most ppl in the Totnes constituency oppose a return to fox hunting Sat Mar 07 09:09:15 GMT 2015
.@DamianAStuart I have taken soundings as it happens & even in a largely rural constituency most ppl oppose a return to fox hunting Sat Mar 07 09:07:11 GMT 2015

@jfb_smoggy @timothy_stanley the legal position has been clarified by both DH & CMO & abortion on grounds of gender alone is already illegal Tue Feb 24 00:18:10 GMT 2015

The Bruce amendment is a Trojan horse which would erode the Abortion Act & MPs should reject it; my blog http://t.co/AJk7CU7UPO Mon Feb 23 17:35:59 GMT 2015
@DJack_Journo (typo corrected!) my blog sets out why we should stop glamourising these girls http://t.co/AYVGuZx4jh Mon Feb 23 11:04:31 GMT 2015
As with attempts to block mitochondrial donation, IMO the Bruce amendment is a veneer with  altogether different underlying agenda. Beware! Mon Feb 23 11:02:17 GMT 2015
The Bruce amendment is particularly malign as it sneaks in undermining wording of abortion Act alongside another issue re gender preference Mon Feb 23 10:57:15 GMT 2015
We won't stem the flow of teenagers to IS by glamourising their actions;  remember the real victims. My blog http://t.co/AYVGuZx4jh Mon Feb 23 08:50:07 GMT 2015
Another reason I will be voting against today's attempt to undermine the Abortion Act  http://t.co/IC7jnpknYg Mon Feb 23 07:19:43 GMT 2015
There's a reason why women's groups won't support today's attempt to undermine the wording of the Abortion Act http://t.co/rP534BwJRs Mon Feb 23 07:04:23 GMT 2015
@HomeVictory inverted commas as press quote. Mental capacity/evidence of coercion also relevant assessing those who join ultra-violent gangs Sun Feb 22 23:01:55 GMT 2015
@Alizou maybe start thinking more about the real victims of IS like countless thousands of Yazidis Shia Christians atheists & LGBT murdered Sun Feb 22 18:20:34 GMT 2015
.@Victoria__Adams I used  'A-grade' quote to point out the absurdity of media reporting. Capacity & extent of grooming & coercion relevant Sun Feb 22 16:36:40 GMT 2015
@Victoria__Adams as I say, that would be for the courts to decide but we should be wary of media glamourising them as passive victims Sun Feb 22 16:32:28 GMT 2015
@Sanya_Sheikh thousands of girls subject to horrific coercive control; none more so than IS victims of torture/slavery/rape/murder Sun Feb 22 16:12:08 GMT 2015
@Victoria__Adams that would be for a court to decide but some responsibility for jihadi brides to check what they're glamourising/colluding Sun Feb 22 16:06:57 GMT 2015
.@Sanya_Sheikh it is absurd to portray 'jihadi brides' entirely as passive victims when they are bright 'A-grade' students with capacity Sun Feb 22 15:39:17 GMT 2015
In what sense were these 'jihadi brides' subject to coercive control? If they have capacity surely share some responsibility for joining IS Sun Feb 22 15:24:24 GMT 2015
Portraying 'jihadi brides' as nothing more than duped gullible victims doesn't help IMO. We don't apply to culpable violent gang membership Sun Feb 22 14:01:53 GMT 2015
Even the briefest Internet search shows the reality of life under IS = mass murder, torture, enslavement, rape. Remember their real victims Sun Feb 22 13:59:16 GMT 2015
@CatholicHeywood @edrennie77 but guidance clearly updated since then. This is an antiabortion amendment masquerading as protecting girls Sun Feb 22 13:52:07 GMT 2015
@PRSD clearly it would be wrong to fine people without having made them aware of the need for an exemption certificate & help to get one Sun Feb 22 13:49:00 GMT 2015
Abortion on the grounds of gender alone is already illegal. I fear the Bruce amendment has a different agenda & I won't be supporting it Sun Feb 22 12:06:26 GMT 2015
Given it's preferred transit route to join IS, we should not be allowing unaccompanied <18s to fly to Turkey without parental consent Sun Feb 22 09:20:35 GMT 2015
@BenCooper86 the agenda seems to me to be to erode the abortion Act so I won't be supporting the Bruce Amendment Sun Feb 22 09:00:53 GMT 2015
@BenCooper86 pretty clear that female foeticide is already illegal solely on grounds of not wanting a girl. Amendment has different agenda! Sun Feb 22 08:55:04 GMT 2015
Joining IS knowingly colludes with their grotesque mass murders, torture, enforced slavery & rape. No one can claim not to know Sun Feb 22 08:51:49 GMT 2015
@unojen_wood I have great sympathy for the countless thousands of victims of inhuman IS but not for those who collude with them Sun Feb 22 08:20:55 GMT 2015
.@RichieParf we prosecute gang members who actively collude with murderers & rapists so why are these teens more deserving of our sympathy? Sat Feb 21 22:42:29 GMT 2015
No sympathy for so-called A-Grade girls travelling to Syria without doing their homework on IS rape & murder of women http://t.co/irHaECjuKW Sat Feb 21 22:22:41 GMT 2015
@cpeedell I have a closer view & one that is not clouded by stereotyping or prejudice. Those elements strong&vocal & need a centre balance Sat Feb 21 18:56:21 GMT 2015
@ReachEd it doesn't have to be mushy! Sat Feb 21 16:39:59 GMT 2015
@ParvaPower I think the extremes of all Parties shout loudest Sat Feb 21 16:36:57 GMT 2015
@ReachEd that was not because Conservatives had reformed too much or moved too far to centre, but not far enough IMO. Centre forward! Sat Feb 21 16:32:27 GMT 2015
@52_ian talking about EFSF bailouts Sat Feb 21 16:24:28 GMT 2015
.@cpeedell I'm proud to represent the compassionate centre right which underpins Conservatism. It would be unelectable without it Sat Feb 21 16:21:40 GMT 2015
@JimandBexley no, it was this govt which rightly extracted Britain from the EFSF Sat Feb 21 16:09:25 GMT 2015
@Uppo1963 presumably you can vote Labour to restart British taxpayers' bailouts for the failed Eurozone. No thanks! Sat Feb 21 15:48:32 GMT 2015
@DavdBell seriously would you like to see British taxpayers funding the bailout? Sat Feb 21 15:45:37 GMT 2015
@RunninRich thanks Richard Sat Feb 21 15:37:31 GMT 2015
Imagine if we had still been tied into bailing out the Greek economy & propping up the Eurozone. Conservatives extracted us from that mess Sat Feb 21 15:36:53 GMT 2015
@Zehra_Zaidi agree these stereotypes are unhelpful Sat Feb 21 15:23:31 GMT 2015
@LeeHowgate yes, if a real choice between candidates allowing voters to opt4 left or right of Party, background & views, otherwise pointless Sat Feb 21 15:16:35 GMT 2015

@theresecoffey if DWP want to call ppl for assessments, should call them direct not try to impose chilling compulsory medical referrals Thu Feb 19 07:56:55 GMT 2015
@theresecoffey for whom, the doctors or their patients? Thu Feb 19 07:54:36 GMT 2015

Sadly still no clarification from No10 that they will not impose coerced consent to medical treatment #consentmatters Mon Feb 16 12:59:02 GMT 2015
First coerced consent would come for drug addicts, alcohol dependants & the obese but who next? #consentmatters Mon Feb 16 12:18:07 GMT 2015
State sanctioned coerced consent for medical treatment is a spectre that would soon be knocking at all our doors #consentmatters Mon Feb 16 12:16:13 GMT 2015
Proposal for the State to extend imposition of medical treatments under coerced consent is one that we must utterly reject #consentmatters Mon Feb 16 12:08:46 GMT 2015
Remember Alan Turing, His horrific treatment which led to his suicide was an example of coerced consent #consentmatters Mon Feb 16 12:04:33 GMT 2015
@paulinegrant1 only following a conviction for a criminal offence; being on sickness benefits is not a crime! #consentmatters Sun Feb 15 21:17:16 GMT 2015
@theresecoffey it would also be a mistake to think coerced treatment likely to succeed; won't save taxpayers a penny either Sun Feb 15 10:30:37 GMT 2015
@theresecoffey happy to discuss but relevant right now is urgent need for govt to withdraw proposal for unlawful coerced referrals/treatment Sun Feb 15 09:55:37 GMT 2015
@quakerpen @David_Cameron I have written an urgent letter but still awaiting acknowledgement or response Sun Feb 15 09:42:02 GMT 2015
@theresecoffey as I state in my tweets Therese there are strictly controlled exceptions under mental capacity Act & Mental Health Acts Sun Feb 15 09:40:49 GMT 2015
The latest DWP proposals wld be asking doctors to break the law. Coerced referrals/treatments must be withdrawn immediately #consentmatters Sun Feb 15 08:57:03 GMT 2015
The only exceptions to this are under strictly controlled circumstances within the Mental Health Acts & Mental Capacity Act #consentmatters Sun Feb 15 08:40:50 GMT 2015
Competent adult patients are entitled to refuse treatment, even where it would clearly benefit their health. #consentmatters Sun Feb 15 08:38:55 GMT 2015
Consent must be given voluntarily and not under any form of duress or undue influence; doctors cannot examine pts referred under coercion Sun Feb 15 08:37:07 GMT 2015
Consent must be obtained before any examination, treatment or care for competent adult patients. #consentmatters Sun Feb 15 08:33:25 GMT 2015
@trishgreenhalgh good to hear, hope you are home soon Sun Feb 15 08:21:58 GMT 2015
@wallaceme @Francislunn best incentive is to make therapeutic approach attractive & accessible. Sat Feb 14 22:22:26 GMT 2015
@wallaceme that's a complete non sequitur, unrelated to the issue of whether a person has ethically valid consent if they are coerced. Sat Feb 14 22:18:10 GMT 2015
A simple guide to medical consent which makes it clear why doctors cannot implement coerced consent  http://t.co/b9aCqt1Q2l #consentmatters Sat Feb 14 20:49:20 GMT 2015
Coercive consent to treatment is NOT consent to treatment. Please tweet your MP to ask if they agree because #consentmatters Sat Feb 14 18:51:40 GMT 2015
It would also be easy to pretend to engage with treatment, wasting resources denied to someone who really does want help #consentmatters Sat Feb 14 18:44:09 GMT 2015
It's not as if there were an oversupply of treatment places; coercive treatment would undermine drug & alcohol services #consentmatters Sat Feb 14 18:39:59 GMT 2015
Quite apart from ethics, NHS resources will be wasted if clinics filled with ppl who don't want to be there & won't benefit #consentmatters Sat Feb 14 18:37:08 GMT 2015
#consentmatters because treatments imposed without ethical consent are more likely to fail Sat Feb 14 17:51:06 GMT 2015
#consentmatters because it is a fundamental principle of medical ethics underpinning doctor patient relationship Sat Feb 14 17:49:42 GMT 2015
Anyone for a tweetathon on why #consentmatters & unethical coercive treatments don't work? Sat Feb 14 17:47:53 GMT 2015
@ksnmiyagi absolutely! Sat Feb 14 17:22:09 GMT 2015
I have sent an urgent letter to No10. We absolutely cannot implement coercive consent to treatment because that is NOT consent to treatment! Sat Feb 14 17:03:29 GMT 2015
The @gmcuk should take a dim view of any doctor who treats a patient who is 'consenting' under coercion Sat Feb 14 16:25:31 GMT 2015
'Consent' to medical treatment is not true consent if it is under a threat. Sat Feb 14 16:13:22 GMT 2015
I'm in favour of incentives to help those addicted to drugs/alcohol/junk food but sanctions linked to medical treatment are unethical Sat Feb 14 16:09:09 GMT 2015

@peterpalmer52  he is misguided in thinking this is the way to achieve it. Lost my mum to ovarian cancer too btw so understand his motives Sun Feb 08 18:50:08 GMT 2015
@cpeedell it's a Lords private members bill Clive, not a govt bill & it should stay that way. Must not go through without commons debate Sun Feb 08 18:25:41 GMT 2015

@DominicNutt rich will be easy prey for those offering snake oil without enrolment in clinical trials & removes recourse to compensation Sun Feb 08 17:49:21 GMT 2015
@DominicNutt the bill risks  undermining clinical trials for the reasons we have discussed & private clinics most likely to avoid trials 1/2 Sun Feb 08 17:45:33 GMT 2015
#SaatchBill increases risk to patients from quacks & fraudsters who prey on the vulnerable & must not pass on the nod without Commons debate Sun Feb 08 16:56:37 GMT 2015
It would be an absolute disgrace for a bill which undermines medical research to be rushed through without debate in the Commons #SaatchBill Sun Feb 08 16:49:06 GMT 2015

@A11_Seeing_Eye  @georgegalloway disturbing to see the rise in the orchestrated use of mobs by Right & Left to intimidate & obstruct debate Fri Feb 06 21:32:54 GMT 2015
Nothing 'hilarious' about deploying thugs to prevent a legitimate political meeting. #Rotherham Fri Feb 06 21:23:32 GMT 2015
@OliVergnault tried to call, have left message with your colleague Fri Feb 06 19:58:38 GMT 2015
@Prof_Anil_Jain all but 1 resident wanted to tell me how good the local surgery is but mixed views & interesting discussion on 'call first' Fri Feb 06 19:57:16 GMT 2015
@DartingtonHall @TTTotnes & Parish Council terrific programme for #futurehomesconference today & Saturday http://t.co/H13AwHOj5U Fri Feb 06 19:44:01 GMT 2015
Thanks to everyone at Salt Quay Moorings for such a wide ranging meeting sharing views on defence, assisted dying, foreign aid & renewables Fri Feb 06 19:37:46 GMT 2015
Great to visit @KingsbridgeCC today to discuss why voting matters    https://t.co/OK55ReTbXe Fri Feb 06 19:32:50 GMT 2015
@SamBarrell1 @sdtccg best wishes in your new role Sam & thank you Fri Feb 06 19:25:14 GMT 2015
@KatsDekker thank you Thu Feb 05 11:53:39 GMT 2015
@kevin_j_foster I know Kevin and working extraordinarily hard on no pay Thu Feb 05 10:42:42 GMT 2015
Not going to a private school did make the Commons feel more 'alien', it is not just the % game but understanding bizarre rules of the club Thu Feb 05 10:36:29 GMT 2015
.@montie Selection Ctees tend to prefer male PPCs who can commit own funds. We have to address selection bias to broaden background of MPs Thu Feb 05 10:29:21 GMT 2015
Talking to women, the level of aggression in politics & worries about impact on family are the main deterrents + cost/career interruption Thu Feb 05 10:16:55 GMT 2015
Still far too costly to become a PPC with many giving up work on no pay to campaign for months before an election. Excludes those who can't Thu Feb 05 10:11:08 GMT 2015
Parties won't increase the diversity of background of MPs until they actively go out an encourage applications & allow PPCs a normal life Thu Feb 05 10:09:40 GMT 2015
@TheBMA your article should have set out that publicly funded healthcare will be excluded http://t.co/oGx4fACUXu Wed Feb 04 20:09:46 GMT 2015
An independent Commission into acute adult psychiatric care has been launched today http://t.co/X6i2VxfwBP Wed Feb 04 08:39:01 GMT 2015
.@TotnesRail @FGW @crosscountryuk high time for greater availability of e-tickets that can be downloaded on mobile phone Tue Feb 03 20:51:59 GMT 2015
@Peter_J_Farmer only because exclusively passed down maternal line not because they confer greater intelligence/beauty/personality Tue Feb 03 07:47:15 GMT 2015
@markgfh really sorry to have to miss today's debate as I'm chairing @CommonsHealth at the same time but will be there to support the vote Tue Feb 03 07:40:29 GMT 2015
.@theresecoffey donating 37 genes out of a baby's 22,000 doesn't make anyone a 'parent'; an act of altruism like being a bone marrow donor Tue Feb 03 07:32:01 GMT 2015
klaxons that children wld need lifelong monitoring after #mitochondrial donation ignore fact they already do with severe & horrible diseases Tue Feb 03 07:26:28 GMT 2015
Donating 37 out of a baby's 22,000 genes doesn't make anyone a 'parent'; the language about #mitochondrial donation is skewing the debate Tue Feb 03 07:20:11 GMT 2015
I'd have more respect for MPs objecting to #mitochondrial donation on ethical grounds if up front on that rather than proxy safety arguments Mon Feb 02 19:59:16 GMT 2015
I hope compassion & common sense will bring hope for families affected by #mitochondrialdisease in tomorrow's vote http://t.co/pb8nZCMapJ Mon Feb 02 19:54:54 GMT 2015
Minister also confirms that ONS CAMHS prevalence survey will  include early years Mon Feb 02 15:53:55 GMT 2015
Good to hear minister confirm funding now identified so expanded #CAMHS prevalence survey will go ahead next year & be repeated regularly Mon Feb 02 15:51:14 GMT 2015
Places of worship should welcome everyone, regardless of race, sex, faith or none & @cathynewman deserves an apology http://t.co/v0ZZWaxz94 Sun Feb 01 23:09:15 GMT 2015
Diet, Exercise & Health @CommonsHealth Inquiry starts Tuesday http://t.co/h7zNlBxWzI aiming to lose 10% of myself, how difficult is that? Sun Feb 01 19:16:46 GMT 2015
@MileDolphins 3am why just why?! Sun Feb 01 12:48:59 GMT 2015
@eddwilson  but no feeling left at all in my fingers or toes by the time I got back! 🚲🚲 Sun Feb 01 12:35:36 GMT 2015
Stuff the #FiftyShades claptrap if you want serious pain & pleasure I recommend 70k of freezing rain & North wind tandeming on Dartmoor Sun Feb 01 12:32:07 GMT 2015
17.6% live in rural areas; recommendations for govt from the rural proofing review https://t.co/ZDOvp4SyDx #ourcountysidematters Sun Feb 01 12:25:42 GMT 2015
.@matthewrjames I'm supporting #mitochondrial donation; a great advance to help affected families & end avoidable suffering Sun Feb 01 08:12:37 GMT 2015

@COPDdoc 2/2 shldnt we have a conversation about just making it illegal? We differ in what we think Wld work -not our aim. I respect that. Sat Apr 25 19:37:38 BST 2015

@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor @WeNurses @NHSEngland likewise. Wed Mar 11 06:51:08 GMT 2015
@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor @WeNurses I just remain to be convinced that having bigger salary than recommended by @NHSEngland =a good #NHS leader Tue Mar 10 23:45:17 GMT 2015
@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor @WeNurses agree. Also think us politicians to blame too. Too target driven, wrong incentives for managers. Tue Mar 10 23:43:42 GMT 2015

@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor maybe you think ethos of NHS shld be same as private sector.I certainly don't. Service+vocation essential. @wenurses Tue Mar 10 20:11:57 GMT 2015
@HSJEditor Prime Minister? Secretaries of State? Also publicly funded but far more risk attached to keeping job. Tue Mar 10 20:10:34 GMT 2015
@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor call me old fashioned, but I think there shld be a sense of vocation+duty for managers as well as front line staff.. Tue Mar 10 20:08:45 GMT 2015
@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor indeed-I just don't equate good leadership w'taking an above-recommended salary in an era when funding #NHS so tight! Tue Mar 10 20:07:34 GMT 2015
@JCHannah77 @HSJEditor really?I'd be more concerned about expertise+welfare of the ppl treating my family than how much £ top brass paid... Tue Mar 10 14:26:04 GMT 2015
@HSJEditor sure, point taken. But afraid I do think that going above a recommended tax-funded salary that is already high is pretty awful. Tue Mar 10 14:19:06 GMT 2015
@IanLex2 @HSJEditor I just don't see how managers going above @NHSEngland  recommended pay level,w' almost no accountability is right? Tue Mar 10 12:55:17 GMT 2015

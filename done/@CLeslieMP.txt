@OurNHS_oD you're right- it Wld be v difficult and we mustn't penalise people who need help for their addiction. Big practical challenges.
@sandra_sanlawro @val_hudson for serial missed appointments- was the issue I think is worth exploring at least.
@val_hudson @sandra_sanlawro yes, I agree. We must preserve free at point of use, based on need, despite challenges. http://t.co/Da2xbyfbIc
@sandra_sanlawro @val_hudson so sorry.I am UTTERLY against charging to see docs too. See my actual thoughts here: http://t.co/Da2xbyfbIc

@Bristol_Braille yes!
@FordCarole @MatSilk @DrCJohn @clarercgp I fear that coz debating some aspects of NHS taboo, we're not gathering evidence needed to improve
@FordCarole @MatSilk @DrCJohn @clarercgp I would be fascinated to know results.
@Cumpedelibero 2/2 for political gain.Unless this stops,we'll have to explain 2 future generations why party politics trumped preserving NHS
@Cumpedelibero disappointing how attempt to debate how to reduce missed GP appointments,preventing needy getting care,so misrepresented 1/2
@FordCarole @MatSilk @DrCJohn @clarercgp what have been the effects? Has it made a difference on rates of missed appointments?
@DrCJohn @clarercgp @FordCarole all suggestions on how we cut down missed GP appointments v welcome. Good to have sensible debate+ideas.
@clarercgp @FordCarole @ImpatientNHS I'm v.against charging for use. And Thoughts on how we radically reduce missed GP apntmnts v welcomed.
@rogerkline @ShaunLintern thanks Roger. Just think it's important we have the freedom to have an informed,sensible debate on it.

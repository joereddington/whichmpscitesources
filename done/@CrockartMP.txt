While judging is happening in #RGT we've been treated to the short film animation entries incl. Dr Poo and the germ. Nothing more I can say
Unfortunately won't be seeing Primary One Direction this evening. No really. This is an actual tribute band. 1 night only. But last night.
Act 12 #RGT - Stephanie doing Punk Rocker. Singing about 1977. Born 25 years later. Jeez I'm old.
Act 11 #RGT - L-Vio doing German Dance on the violin. With added scary ghosts. And dry ice.
Act 10 #RGT - Abbi doing the John Lewis Xmas advert. But no sign of either bear or rabbit...
Act 9 #RGT - Dazzle Diamonds Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepson. So much attitude in those so young. #whatever
Act 8 #RGT - K and K doing Read all about It by Emeli Sande. I'm not afraid to say there's a tear in my eye. #inagoodway
Act 7 - only boy of evening. Time for Joshy J. Doing True Colours by entire Glee Cast. On his own... Nice bit of street dance there.
Halfway in #RGT so time for intermission... http://t.co/SY6TLSgydz
Act 6 #RGT Ratho Starlets. Dancing to The Wanted. My Universe Will Never Be The Same. #howtrue
Act 5 is Rebecca. Doing The Climb by Miley Cyrus. Thankfully no wrecking ball in sight
Act 4 Kool Kelsey. Roar by Katie Perry. "I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar!" #ibelieveya #gogirl
Live tweeting Ratho's Got Talent. Sell-out and don't want you to miss out.
Act 3 Ebow Violinist doing The Boat to Inverie.  Feet are tapping in the hall!
Act 2. Solo act Eryn doing Sk8er Boy. Has just thrown her scooter to the floor. Very dramatically. ✌️
Act 1 The Dino Divas doing Boom boom shackalackalacka boom. #everybodydothedinosaur http://t.co/gaxkUO2JAe
@joannasaurusrex I'll tell you in 3 hours!
2 mins until "Ratho's Got Talent"! Excitement is unbearable...

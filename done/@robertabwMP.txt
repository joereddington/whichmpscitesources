Oh dear Cameron completely loses it - can't answer straightforward question from @LilianGreenwood on whether he plans to raise VAT #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband asks whether Cameron will campaign to stay in Europe or not? Straightforward question and no answer but abuse from PM #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband so right to challenge Cameron about losing control of his backbenchers and having no support for   his plans in Europe #pmqs
2/2 After all if Osborne supports North why do we get a tiny percentage of his department's infrastructure spending & unfair local gov cuts?
1/2 A pity not to be called at Treasury questions on Northern Powerhouse. Wanted to let Tory Chancellor know I'm sceptical about his support

@CatrionaRiddel1 don't agree top down approach is right way forward. We need to incentivise Local Authorities to bring ideas fwd #PFHConf
Now on to panel discussion. First person says we must see planning system as tool for delivering more housing not a block. So agree #PFHConf
Packed conference hall demonstrates the key issue that delivering more housing has become in sector and politically @PlanningMag #PFHConf
Fascinating to hear Trevor Osborne talk of Wolfson Prize & need fr garden cities to have social as well as physical infrastructure #PFHConf

Cameron's aggressive, bullish & angry answers to perfectly sensible questions exactly wht puts so many people & women esp off politics #pmqs
I am happy to tell Prime Minster that what makes me me glum is the thought of 5 more years of him. Need @Ed_Miliband instead #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband putting PM v much on defensive on NHS. Cameron rattling off bogus stats won't convince anyone that NHS safe in his hands #pmqs

Oh dear Cameron adopting defensive mode. Not good when he is resorting to Leveson rather than giving an explanation for his behaviour #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband asked clear question to PM as to why he ignored warnings from a range of sources abt Coulson. As usual no answer from PM #pmqs
In Chamber early fr #pmqs. Hope @Ed_Miliband calls Cameron to account re the Coulson & awful phone hacking debacle. Surely PM judgment issue

Message from excellent Home Improvement Report by @Shelter & Electrical Safety First shows more protection needed for tenants #prsreform
Plsd to be talking @Shelter elect/saf/first #prsreform event speaking abt electrical safety or sometimes lack of it in private rented sector
It's clear we haven't been building enough social & affordable homes for many years. Use of PRS may help but we need Councils to build again

Watching @Ed_Miliband doing fantastic job on PP Broadcast highlighting huge damage to NHS under Tories. He would lead it to a better future!
Grt q frm @KevinBrennanMP . PM blaming Labour again. Can someone remind him that he's been in power for 4 years. He forgets obviously #pmqs
PM really stumbling on AstraZeneca just blaming Labour. Pathetic! @Ed_Miliband right to remind PM of Royal Mail sell off fiasco #pmqs
PM again dodging important questions about his position on the Pfizer proposed takeover of AstraZeneca. No answer, just bluster as usual
@Ed_Miliband showing he can be gracious and statesmanlike at #pmqs. Pity the Prime Minister can't be the same.
So pleased to join my parliamentary colleagues to show our wholehearted support for the #BringBackOurGirls campaign http://t.co/NArzOQRdGL

“@LabourLeft: First they’ll kill our medical research then they’ll kill our NHS by @Val_Hudson http://t.co/XIPMZITzNF Excellent article Val!
Too much complacency on Tory side about the economy.  Growth still variable across the country and we have too many zero hrs contracts #pmqs
Really worried that Tory led gov isn't taking the threat to British science seriously enough in Pfizer takeover bid for AstraZeneca #pmqs
Cameron showing he is totally out of touch with needs of many thousands of people in the private rented sector who need more stability #pmqs
Cameron going on abt rent controls & missing the point about needing predictable rent increases & more stability in private rntd sec #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband making a strong opening case for supporting longer term tenancies in private rented sector. What will gov do? #pmqs
Great Parl Uni Group tonight with Martin Bean from OU & Simon Marginson, IFE on challenges facing UK HE to stay internationally competitive
Asked Vince Cable about impact of proposed Pfizer takeover of Astrazeneca on British science. He needs to be more concerned & take action!
“@RCornwell: Something familiar about the design, then it hit me: this is what it reminded me of http://t.co/qzoL0wynZc It's not that silly!
Pls make views on plans for bus station & reconfiguration of North Rd known to @DurhamCouncil. Need plans that will enhance historic city!
@DurhamCouncil consulting on plans for new bus station. My opinion - unsuitable for entrance to city and site so close to historic viaduct.
A key point surely is the global nature of capital and its mobility. National govs are not good at adressing this @BBCNewsnight #inequality
Only a matter of time before @BBCNewsnight held an interview with Tom Piketty. Hope Paxman treats his work and issue of inequality seriously
Many thx too to everyone for our second #labourdoorstep today in Esh Winning Durham to support our Euro campaign http://t.co/iCmy4ZJnNA

“@politicshome: Tomorrow’s Independent front page: Scandal of the empty free schools http://t.co/ezLSTt3eW9” Durham not unique then!!
Has the BBC actually become the Tory Party press office? Emily Maitlis piece on Boris outrageous & couldn't be more adulatory #newsnight
@Jude_KD doing an excellent job @BBCNewsNE highlighting limited appeal of UKIP to Labour voters in North East
I hope NE sticks to its principles of valuing community and wanting more high value employment in area and rejects divisive message of UKIP
Does anyone actually care what Danny Alexander says?Surely he is just after jobs for Lib Dems #totallylackinginprinciples #can'ttrustlibdems
“@BBCMarkDenten: Farage says if UKIP held balance of power at Westminster he would demand referendum on EU Unsurprising but not good for NE!
@observer report on NUT conf accurately describing Free School problem in Durham & elsewhere - vast sums of money, few pupils & not needed
Thoughtful @Sadgrovem sermon @durhamcathedral using contrast with Robert Herrick's 'To Daffodils' to highlight renewal & hope Easter brings
@paulleake it was really good to be there. In general I wish there was more appreciation of the work Parish Councillors do #democracymatters

Really amazing visit to Stroud.Residents groups very knowledgeable about planning with good suggestions for reform http://t.co/oDnWe5eWOR
Asked Higher Ed Minister why students included in net migration target and negative impact this is having on overseas recruitment. No answer
@DianaJohnsonMP so right to raise issue of gov needing to do more to rebalance the economy across regions. Gov response very disappointing
In BIS Questions - excellent q from @PaulBlomfield on why the government is not more concerned about RAB charge of 46%. Willetts complacent
@JulieHillingMP welcome to twittersphere Julie. Hope to hear lots from you on the dreadful damage this gov is inflicting on youth services
Some of the fab LG leaders & MPs who met to discuss particular ways women are affected by cuts to council services http://t.co/2wPUwbBISy
Great meeting at Westminster with women local government leaders. Labour councils are concerned about lack of jobs, childcare and carers
@M4COnline @emily4MK @simonnread @TheIndyMoney
Britain is on its way back ok - to insecurity in employment, attacks on the poor and vulnerable and other divisions of the 1980s #pmqs
Tories protecting jobs of miners would be a staggeringly huge change of policy and practice #pmqs #remember1984
Tories very weak on women. PM shouldn't demand role models from science sectors when he is so bad at promoting women himself #pmqs
PM turning attack on @Ed_Miliband re  Maria Miller issue just won't wash. Actually PM appears weak and pathetic #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband calling into question the PM's handling of the Maria Miller issue saying he made 'a terrible error of judgment' #pmqs
Great article by @hilarybennmp outlining Labour's New Deal for England. Vital that we generate growth in every region http://t.co/QFCYOv4Rfw
I was able to raise the importance of the Durham -Lesotho Diocesan link and the important role Durham Uni plays training teachers in Lesotho
Pleased to have really productive meeting with Lesotho PM and his Ministerial delegation this morning via @CPA_UK http://t.co/lfhjhKDt2a
@wesstreeting @louisebaldock exactly!  I suspect 
many parents would like to see new community schools despite dogma of Gove & Coalition Gov
@wesstreeting @louisebaldock Hi Wes - you might need places but they shouldn't have to be provided by Free Scools should they?
@LouiseBaldock - I sympathise - have similar siutation in Durham. Does Stockton need additional school places? if not, huge waste of money!
@Ed_Miliband right to emphasise ongoing issue of #costofliving crisis. My constituents face falling wages & rising prices #sundaypolitics
Need to do more to get people engaged in politics. I agree but are David Mellor''s sneering comments really the way to do this? #Murnaghan
@pollytoynbee putting really challenging questions to IDS so he's just talking over her. Clearly has no justification for his policies #marr
IDS failed to address that if people move to private sector -higher rents mean housing benefit higher. Labour will repeal #Marr #bedroomtax
Please point out to callous IDS that a policy of chucking people out of their homes when smaller ones  not available. Just daft #marrshow
Again absolutely right that @MarrShow pointing out true costs of IDS/Tory policy being borne by the most vulnerable #marrshow #unfair
IDS has his head in the sand and is simply ignoring problems with ATOS. Also fails to address issue of rising Foodbank use #marrshow
IDS needs to look at measures like Labour's Job Guarantee so that young unemployed (standing at around 1m ) get into employment #marrshow
Could someone PLEASE tell IDS that the way to reduce welfare bill is getting people into work NOT by penalising sick & disabled #marrshow
IDS talking tosh on @MarrShow everyone knows government's welfare reform unfair and unworkable #marrshow
Hope IDS gets a real grilling on the obscenity that is the bedroom tax and it costs more money than saves. Coming up #marrshow
Really good that @MarrShow pointing out what SNP is doing is driving the politics of division. @TogetherDarling needs to say more on this
@TogetherDarling reminding all of us that positive case for Scotland staying in UK needs to be made again and again #marrshow
It is time we gave more attention to what is happening in Scotland @TogetherDarling making powerful case for staying together #marrshow
Plsd discussants #marrshow also picking up on housing crisis. Despite all their rhetoric & reannouncements too few houses built #toryfail
Clegg such damaged goods and could  face a wipeout in Euro elections @pollytoynbee #marrshow. Good!
@pollytoynbee right that complications of benefit system obscure some of the most unfair aspects of Tories welfare reform #marrshow
Gove's Ed policy falling apart. Crisis over school places and failing Free Schools
Glad that for the momemt at least democracy is winning out in Afghanistan. Pay tribute to wonderfully resilient people in beautiful country.
Great to be out with our fab North East Euro candidates @Jude_KD @Jayne_Shotton in Kelloe, Durham #labourdoorstep http://t.co/nQ7fClriMj
Important debate in Parlt yesterday on the future of @EnglishHeritage- more info on can be found here: http://t.co/5ihIbJjKB5 #Durham
@HelenGoodmanMP making powerful case about way in which gov has failed to adequately look after Hadrians Wall. Said it would if in the South
Also used the opportunity to promote Durham unashamedly & the beauty of our wonderful historic city that needs protecting #englishheritage
Key issue is ensuring planning & advisory role of new Historic England body will not be compromised by commercial concerns #englishheritage
V pleased to speak in debate about the future of #EnglishHeritage. Not sure gov proposals will give enough protection to places like Durham
In W'minster Hall for the debate on the future of @EnglishHeritage and what the Govt's proposed changes could mean for #Durham and the NE
Cameron returning to his usual nastiness at #pmqs. Can't even answer a question abt student finance without reference to Labour. Ridiculous!
PM making a fortune for the few as usual not on the side of the British people. @Ed_Miliband once again raising issues of substance #pmqs
PM cannot be serious suggesting Royal Mail sale a success. He couldn't even get gentleman's agreement' with his City friends to stick #pmqs
@Ed_Miliband justifiably raising the governments total mishandling of the Royal Mail sale. Tax payers lose out to Tory City friends! #pmqs
Enjoyed speaking at the launch of @smith_institute's report on suburban #poverty- important issues raised in report and by fellow speakers
Then papers review going on about the unions and Ed Miliband. Now conservative MP fronting programme on borders. BBC why are you doing this?
I am getting totally fed up with BBC bias. First of all Newsnight suggesting UKIP are a problem for Labour excuse me what about the Tories?
Looking fwd to speaking @smith_institute session tmrw a.m. on the suburbanisation of poverty. Has previously been vastly under researched.
@BGIPU @CPA_UK plsd to highlight the importance of #CSW58  in highlighting need for progress on MDGs. More to do on assessing impact though.
Labour's pilots showed conclusively the benefits of universal free school meals. Needs to be a priority for implementation #sundaypolitics
Lib Dem Education Spokesperson acknowledging Free School Meals policy building on Labour's pilots incl Durham. They need to deliver though!
Thx to @val_hudson & everyone for helping to leaflet Kelloe. Looking forward to Labour Party coffee morning there next week #labourdoorstep
Beautiful tribute to Tony Benn. Exquisite music and inspiring readings alongside warm and moving family memories and spontaneous applause.
In the Chamber of HoC waiting to deliver the Durham students petition against the selling off of the student loan book

Tories don't like being told the truth by @Ed_Miliband. They are doing nothing to help low paid or those in insecure employment #budget2014
Fantastic @Ed_Miliband highlighting the duplicitous actions of Fib Dems saying they don't support Tory policy but voting for it #budget2014
Great that we have Labour Leader @Ed_Miliband sticking up for ordinary people in this country who are worse off under this gov #Budget2014

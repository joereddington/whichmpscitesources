“@Labourpaul: First Hague, now Danny Alexander. The BBC is interviewing the parties who didn't turn up.” Indeed and why on earth are they? Thu Apr 16 21:48:19 BST 2015
Gosh now we have the Lib Dems on and they didn't turn up either but as Emily Malthis says - they were hardly mentioned or missed. I agree Thu Apr 16 21:45:01 BST 2015
Why are Tories allowed in the spin room when Cameron couldn't be bothered to turn up to defend his record? A disgrace surely!! Thu Apr 16 21:35:56 BST 2015

@MickVicDCC it is not about particular developments surely-but principles & people you say I don't represent so see you on 12 June to debate Tue Apr 07 22:08:07 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC thanks Mike will be in touch after the election if all goes well. Meanwhile let me know who you would like invited. Tue Apr 07 21:59:32 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC @paulleake @Bob__Hudson - happy to host a hearing at Redhills on Friday 12 June. See you there? Tue Apr 07 21:42:07 BST 2015
@paulleake @MickVicDCC @Bob__Hudson some cllrs v good at balancing competing interests today & wanting something better for city -others not Tue Apr 07 21:37:12 BST 2015
“@Bob__Hudson: @MickVicDCC @robertabwMP So who are these unheard voices who want their city destroyed by money-grubbing developers?Precisely Tue Apr 07 21:29:05 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC @TimJBlackman @Bob__Hudson so are you seriously saying Durham isn't beautiful - explains a lot! Tue Apr 07 21:26:25 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC @Bob__Hudson So Mike I challenge you to talk to them with me & see if they agree with you about having poor quality development Tue Apr 07 21:25:09 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC are you elected by all of them and if not precisely how are you accountable? Tue Apr 07 21:15:10 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC @Bob__Hudson I think the socialist view of planning is people before profits - were you doing that today? Tue Apr 07 21:13:44 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC I just want to know who you think you are accountable to for the decisions you make? Thx Tue Apr 07 21:04:45 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC by the way Mike can you tell me who you are accountable to for the decisions you made today. Thanks Roberta Tue Apr 07 21:01:35 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC you should know Labour's planning policy is to expect a greater say for people in planning & more neighbourhood planning. Sorry! Tue Apr 07 20:56:26 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC No Mike I don't dismiss planners but it's up to you & your colleagues to demand better quality development for r beautiful city Tue Apr 07 20:50:54 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC as I explained tdy planning system requires cllrs to make decisions incl listening to local views - u shouldn't be an automaton! Tue Apr 07 20:34:51 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC  - well there is an easy way do remedy that Mike - do us all a favour and take yourself off planning committee!!! Tue Apr 07 20:25:14 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC @Bob__Hudson @RCornwell in that case it's a disgrace you're doing nothing to deliver affordable housing/jobs for the longer term Tue Apr 07 20:07:58 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC I thought it would be plain to anybody that building smaller developments in keeping wth the city produces construction jobs too Tue Apr 07 19:59:52 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC well you're seriously reducing our options as almost all land that could be developed for commerce is going to student housing Tue Apr 07 19:58:01 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC short term on a particular development & despite what you say we're not against developmnt but want to get it right for the city Tue Apr 07 19:56:07 BST 2015
@RCornwell thank you Roger. That number should be easy peasy! Tue Apr 07 18:52:47 BST 2015
@val_hudson @Bob__Hudson @LabourNorth very plsd you were able to go Val as I couldn't because of Planning Committee & PC has left me v sad Tue Apr 07 18:44:34 BST 2015
@RCornwell I intend to have street stalls and start collecting signatures as soon as I can. Will also need to see what 7.5% is in numbers. Tue Apr 07 18:37:21 BST 2015
@RCornwell have you just seen my earlier tweet? After Plan Com today I was reflecting on need to have a Town Council & this could help. Thx. Tue Apr 07 18:29:39 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC views at plan com today made me sad. Need lots of jobs in Durham not just short term construction ones. Raise your aspirations! Tue Apr 07 18:08:28 BST 2015
@MickVicDCC your comments today made me very sad indeed. Ee need lots of jobs in Durham not Tue Apr 07 18:04:32 BST 2015
2/2 @CBowmanUK @MickVicDCC cllrs allowing too many sites eg MT Oswald to proceed with no affordable housing & giving rest to PBSA developers Tue Apr 07 18:00:58 BST 2015
1/2 @CBowmanUK indeed & a question for @MickVicDCC who wrongly thinks we're against development in Durham. Not so we need affordable housing Tue Apr 07 17:54:38 BST 2015
So the question I am left pondering after PLan Com today is do we need to consult on a Town Council for the inner city wards? I think we do. Tue Apr 07 17:48:05 BST 2015
@CBowmanUK many councillors of all parties stood up for the city but not enough on the Claypath application and thinking was confused on it Tue Apr 07 17:44:20 BST 2015
Some cllrs did a good job for Durham in objecting to student accommodation that we don't need & arguing for affordable homes that we do.Thx Tue Apr 07 17:41:28 BST 2015
2/2 How can cllrs say devel is too big & then approve it & how can they argue on its economics when they don't know if business rates apply? Tue Apr 07 17:36:54 BST 2015
1/2 Returned from @DurhamCouncil Planning Committee. Gutted that totally inappropriate development in Claypath approved by 6 votes to 5. Tue Apr 07 17:33:11 BST 2015

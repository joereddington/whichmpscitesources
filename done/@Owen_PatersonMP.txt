Germany’s VC Sigmar Gabriel suggests they will abandon 2020 commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 40%. http://t.co/JXLAUFxCyN @SPIEGELONLINE
Disgrace that the green blob has removed Anne Glover, respected scientist whose advice they disliked. Worse still that she's not replaced.
Welcoming Steve Glover to the @Conservatives from UKIP. http://t.co/6TaTMW5WVZ
Delighted to welcome UKIP defector Cllr Steve Glover. He agrees only robust, Conservative policies answer the country’s long term problems.
Pleased to meet Wendy Farrington-Chadd at the RJ&AH Orthopaedic Hospital.  So successful they plan 7 day working. Zero MRSA since 2006.

We must understand that UKIP voters have genuine worries.  Do not abuse them.  Present genuine, Conservative solutions respectfully.
UKIP can identify problems but a Conservative government can deliver solutions. Robust policies can win back the 3.4million lost since 1992.
Great article by @mattwridley . I take no pleasure in being vindicated so quickly. http://t.co/TVBi4Kk7Ac

Here are my comments on Radio Shropshire yesterday, in the wake of the Scottish referendum result. http://t.co/4myRYAstAp
Parliament should be recalled to discuss the Scottish referendum result and a just settlement for England http://t.co/oGeM5b3dYX
To Scotland’s undecideds; there is so much to lose, so little to gain. We are better together – vote No.
@timothy_stanley spot on. Tory Party always pro opportunity and optimism for all. http://t.co/wNRw9T1Fpv

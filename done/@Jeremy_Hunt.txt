@Jeremy_Hunt
Lab talks about privatisation that ISN'T happening whilst still ignoring poor care that DID happen on their watch: politics before patients
Private sector share of NHS spend only up 1% since @andyburnhammp was Health Sec: http://t.co/pMuKGV2xWH
'Privatisation' debate is simply red herring to distract from Labour's record ignoring poor care.
Another day in Parliament, another eg of Labour putting politics before patients: http://t.co/cXAvYS6YFP
Just been in Rochester where I seem to have become an estate agent in some streets. Go for it Kelly!
Profound comments about patient safety in run-up to election by @JamesTitcombe: https://t.co/L1L1skXdFl
Sorry @jreedmp issues like Morecambe Bay infant mortality go back to '02. Rather than point-scoring,accept Govt sorting issues Lab ignored.
New poll from @FTNtweets and @SkyNews says public and NHS staff are confident in tackling winter pressures http://t.co/Ih0L7IgHmK
Read my piece for @ConHome on transparency and why NHS culture still needs to change http://t.co/9IT8IRUOFL
Quote - "There was huge government pressure [under Lab] because the government hated the idea that -- that a regulator would criticise it".
@andyburnhammp time for Labour to support transparency opposed in office - Barbara Young said Gvt "hated" criticism http://t.co/1uE68QdkZR
Major step forward for transparency in healthcare today congrats to @ProfSteveField http://t.co/b7NAq5TNaf
@CNagpaul we know transparency works for hospitals, where problems are finally being sorted. It can work for general practice too!

More A&E facts: http://t.co/UXzKTbEanC
Time for A&E facts @andyburnhammp: 2000+ treated daily in 4hrs than on your watch&longterm solutions through integration that Lab never did
@andyburnhammp if A&E performance is politicians' fault-why the silence re Wales, where unlike England target missed every year since 08?
Hearing today from the Waverley Infrastructure Resilience Group about their Winter Plan.Much achieved & more to do to protect the area
Just been to visit Woolmer Hill school in Haslemere & heard about their brilliant contribution to the WW1 remembrance mural outside station
£10bn savings challenge tough so voters must ask which party has track record on efficiency to deliver it: http://t.co/IWUtPngaN5
With a more compassionate culture we're already seeing, the NHS can turn heads across the world as it blazes a trail for C21 healthcare.
Also set out 10 savings challenges we can help the NHS deliver, which could save £10bn by 2020. Want a new compact with NHS to act on this.
We also need to protect personal data as NHS gets the benefits of sharing - so Dame Fiona Caldicott will become the National Data Guardian.
Tech can be revolutionary in preventative care - in Airedale vulnerable older people can get health advice from a nurse through their TV.
2018 paperless NHS means you will only tell yr story once & with consent, yr electronic health record will b available across system by 2020
So National Information Board plans personalised 21st century healthcare for whole NHS - with power of citizens caring about their health.
NHS has more world firsts than any other publicly funded health system, including 1st IVF baby, but needs to be better at adopting new tech.
So those 4 pillars - strong economy, transforming out of hospital care, harnessing innovation and value for money, changing NHS culture.
But as Forward View makes clear, the only way to grow £113bn NHS budget is ensuring we have an economy generating tax revenue to finance it.
I'm increasingly optimistic that together we can build a new compact across the NHS which achieves the £22bn of efficiencies and better care
I outlined the four pillars of this government's plan for the NHS - how we'll make a reality of the @NHSEngland Five Year Forward View.
Just spoken to @TheKingsFund #kf2014 conference about a vision for a more innovative and efficient #NHS.

Excellent visit to Park End Surgery in Watford with @Richard4Watford to see innovative new plans to offer patients 7 day and evening appts
We’re drawing up plans for a new law allowing regulators to check EU nurses and dentists’ language skills when they apply to work in the UK.
That transparency makes the NHS safer for patients – so will a new system of language checks, building on existing process for EU doctors.
@gmcuk and @nmcnews issuing draft guidance for doctors, nurses and midwives on apologising to patients and explaining when things go wrong.
Two new developments for patient safety in two days – extending the Duty of Candour, and new language checks for EU professional staff.

@premitrom thank you sadly only 2 more years till the big one...
Just last April, we did 300,000 more diagnostic tests than in the month before the general election – and 1.5 million in total.
Gvt. put £750m into cancer care, and referred half a million more patients last year than in 2010 – improves outcomes http://t.co/FH64ZUBkQs
New @ONS report shows cancer survival rates continue to improve, helped particularly by earlier diagnosis & treatment http://t.co/qW5mUEB8ap
Read my op-ed in @Telegraph today setting out our plan to secure the future of the NHS http://t.co/GiaoQM3My6
Next year that means 18k community staff and better care closer to home – 160,000 fewer emergency stays in hospital, saving the NHS £500m.
Big changes this morning as we announce £5bn of pooled budgets joining up health and social care services through the Better Care Fund.
Our zero-tolerance approach is bringing about real improvements for patients – and saves money too, £22.5 million already.
@TheSunNewspaper wrote this week about the ‘huge fall in MRSA’ under this government. Number of cases down by more than half.

Real shame 2 see key Today prog interview wth Simon Stevens on #5YFV hijacked by 38 Degrees public/private scaremongering. Missed big issues
Time for Labour to put up or shut up on NHS in Wales: if it is as good as England why not back independent study by OECD?
Just met Tim Shoveller MD of SWT to discuss ways to improve local train services including new car park at Haslemere. Looking encouraging.
We will now have 260 more emergency medics for A&E – a record number – and 1,000 more since 2010 http://t.co/jMLLJwqUzH

Read @lauradonnlee piece on virtual eradication of mixed sex wards - nearly half a million nights of distress saved http://t.co/CQWXCHd11l
That @andyburnhammp response proves Labour STILL haven’t learnt the lessons of Mid Staffs – they prefer good headlines to good care.
Robert Francis is clear that our emphasis on safety would detect care failures ‘much more quickly’ http://t.co/QbtBP5lQXS
As @DavidNichols0n - former NHS CE - said, "patients were not the centre of the way the system operated" under last Government.
In fact, NHS is becoming safer – 5 hospitals turned around through special measures – precisely because we have an independent inspectorate.
In response to @CareQualityComm State of Care, @andyburnhammp said the report proves the NHS is ‘simply not safe’ under this Gvt.
Main issue for Lab NHS pledges is deliverability: Portugal cut health budget by 17%, Greece by 14% because like Lab they forgot the deficit
Labour left us with worst cancer survival rates in W Europe so this parliament we're treating nearly 3/4 million more for cancer than last
Ultimately, the path to lower cost is the same as the path to safer care – that’s the right path for patients http://t.co/lN0QRlWRad
We have 6,000+ more nurses on wards and higher standards since 2010, but even safer care is better for patients and saves NHS money.
Independent report today suggests poor care costs up to £2.5 bn a year – particularly at a time of financial pressure, it’s a false economy.
Delighted to speak at @Bham_Childrens this morning on how good NHS care costs less - more details here http://t.co/WWktpxXsIP

@andyburnhammp said ‘this is recurrent funding ... money over the five years of the parliament that we can bank on’ – looks doubtful...
Shadow Chancellor confirms absolutely NO money would be raised in 2015/16. NHS patients and staff need promises they can depend on.

Best ever PM speech on NHS: not just secure funding from strong economy but personal commitment & passion to what NHS means for every family
@andyburnhammp NHS choice IS clear: passionate PM who will support it vs economically dangerous opposition leader who wld risk its funding
In my speech to #cpc14 I'll be taking the fight to Labour on the NHS - we're proud of our record, and have a plan for its future.
That contract with @TheBMA will help GPs provide more proactive, personal care for their patients - an important step forward.
And today we've also announced a new GP contract with @TheBMA, which restores named GPs for everyone - abolished by Labour in 2004.
Talking today about improving GP access for millions following PM Challenge Fund pilots last year - pledging £100m new investment next year.
All this while seeing 50% more cancer patients now than 4 years ago – whatever Burnham says, the #NHS is doing better than ever.
We’ve invested £750m in cancer care & are working with @CR_UK, @macmillancancer & GPs to improve early diagnosis.
Cancer patients are positive about getting enough info, being offered treatment options & being treated with respect http://t.co/aWevkzHq3X

Shocking that Burnham fails to mention Mid Staffs even once during his speech.
Andy Burnham talked about NHS privatisation that isn't happening, and failed to mention Mid Staffs, which did.
Less than 5 minutes after criticising the Health and Social Care Act, Burnham promises a reorganisation of the NHS...
Our Nursing Technology Fund has invested £30m on innovative technologies like those in @BMJ_Qual_Saf research, benefiting staff and patients
Great to see @BMJ_Qual_Saf research showing innovative use of technology helps nurses spend less time on paperwork, saving lives.
. @dwilliamsHSJ that £2.7 billion real terms rise is set out in DH annual accounts, p. 28 here https://t.co/86izIoMpq1
Spending actually went up £2.7bn in real terms last year alone. So Labour are promising significantly less than we have actually delivered.
Miliband says £2.5bn more for annual NHS budget, c. 2.2% real terms. We  DELIVERED 4.4% real terms increase - see IFS http://t.co/BhrdnwX1uq
We are putting £12.7 billion more into the #NHS this Parliament because we took the difficult decisions Labour opposed.
These improvements can’t be funded if you bankrupt the economy as the last Labour Government did.
The number of health visitors is up 28 per cent since the election, with 2,250 more in post, helping new families make the best start.
There are 6000 more doctors in the #NHS since 2010, which we can only afford by cutting Labour's waste and removing 20,000 managerial posts.
New @HSCIC stats show we have 6100 more nurses on our wards since the election – means more compassionate, safer care http://t.co/16XZwpHo5y
NHS is getting safer, despite Labour scaremongering. Bringing down number of MRSA cases by 55% has saved £22.5m – funding 101 nurses a year.
Zero-tolerance approach means reduction by 55% in the number of MRSA cases since 2010. Figs show a 23% decrease on same period last year.
Thanks to hard work of #NHS staff, new @PHE_uk figures show MRSA cases have more than halved under this Govt. https://t.co/Pugu97HIna
We have now brought back named GPs for the over 75s which were abolished by Labour in 2004
If Labour think single point of contact for care is so important why did they abolish named GPs in 2004?
This morning Labour announces policy for single point of care...that this govt is already implementing through the better care fund

Just paying homage to Mrs T in my own way...a visit to Bruges
#healthwatch launch. Thanks for having me. It's time to learn from patients and make sure their voices are heard.
At least £1 in every £8 spent on long-term conditions is linked to poor mental health&wellbeing. Desperately need parity of esteem
Tragic sad day but Lady T also reminds us of what politics can be at its best - turning things round against all the odds
Just had meeting with CQC Chair David Prior to discuss role of new Chief Inspector of Hospitals. Will be transformational.
Just done an intentional nursing round in Salford Royal elderly ward & been helping dementia patients eat lunch - superb caring team here
Spent part of last night at St Thomas' A&E. Real commitment from great staff who highlighted lack of availability of mental health services
We can't afford to ignore those with dementia - the financial cost of dementia to the UK was over £23 billion in 2012
See our initial response to Mid Staffs Inquiry - http://t.co/EscYQ4g5uB  - to put patients at the heart of a compassionate NHS
Determined to crackdown on abuse of #NHS. It's a national not international service & only those who have right to free access should get it
10 million adults,1.3 million children in England are obese-among the worst in Europe. Need national & local action to turn this around.
Continuing talks on Govt response to Francis Report. Pleased that all DH Ministers & staff will be getting real experience on NHS frontline.
Nothing from Labour in today's NHS debate shows any recognition of catastrophic policy mistakes that led to Mid Staffs. Tragic complacency
40 communities across Britain want to be dementia friendly so far - double what we hoped #dementiachallenge
About to speak in Manchester Conference on dementia - diagnosis rate 49% in NW which is higher than national avg but still need 2 do better
David Nicholson has apologised, now Labour must too. My ConHome article here http://t.co/Vy5EXzrJVx
@DanHannanMEP good motto Dan for the NHS facing it's current challenges
We want more info, more data public on quality of outcomes in our hospitals - spoke  to Mike Richards workshop today on making this happen
Here's the speech I made at Reform yesterday on how the NHS can free up more time to care: 
https://t.co/BDRl97Tq
About to give speech to Reform saying compassionate care needs less bureaucracy in the NHS - especially on front line
Good discussion with my team this morn on Francis recommendations. Will set out thoughts on tackling NHS bureaucracy @reformthinktank tomoro
Moving words by PM on Mid-Staffs tragedy - my challenge is 2 be able 2 look Stafford families in eye & say I've turned words into action
@NVTweeting @leicesterliz The F&F test will have a free text box so patients can give specific feedback, essential to improve services
@NVTweeting @leicesterliz LGA contacted all 152 councils on 10/01/13, 95% said they'll have an operational service in place by April '13
Good to see so many at Parliamentary reception on dementia. Real momentum for improving care for those who need it.
Over 1million COPD, 1m kidney disease, 800k diabetes cases still go undiagnosed. Good meeting today discussing how primary care can help.
Just been 2 Airedale hosp & seen some of best tech anywhere in NHS including digital patient records shared with GPs - and gr8 patient care
Smoking prevalence now below 20% but reducing to 18.5% would prevent 2500 deaths per year by 2020 - we should aim to be best in Europe
After so long, digital records will become a reality #digitalnhs we still need to go further and faster
Good discussion@clarercgp&Dr Cartmell to identify 400,000people with undiagnosed dementia, we are failing them when they need help the most
Just arriving at Heart of Kent hospice to see how technology can improve palliative care
8355 GP practices in England but which are good and which are failing? Just had meeting to explore how we can find out
No ticked box target is worth a single failure in care - meeting NHS managers this pm to discuss their role in delivering better care.
The NHS works hard for us all at this time of year. I would like to give #GiftofThanks to the #NHS. http://t.co/6wFGWSnR
@GKing17 the pleasure was all mine :-)
Feeling optimistic about progress in dementia research. Thanks @LillyPad for great visit
#thefear is the latest drama to address dementia, showing another side to this disease - the fear is exactly what many of us feel about it
Incredibly concerned at v serious C4 Dispatches suggestion that A Mitchell was stitched up, never believed he used p-word anyway
Fantastic news that NHS 2 publish risk-adjusted surgery success rates by consultant team, bold step that will save 000's of lives
27% of providers failed on 1 or more CQC essential standard. Just had meeting on dealing with the roots of this - changing culture is key.
Good debate at #BAC12. Announced new cancer screening techniques - early diagnosis is key factor to surviving cancer
Cancer patients tell me supporting survivors is vital. 1.8m people have it or have survived it. We need to sort life #beyondcancer
How many people know that NHS Choose&Book allows you to choose any organisation which provides NHS services, regardless of location?
Visiting Guy's and St Thomas' cancer unit before I speak at #BAC12. Gov committed to reducing outcome variations. #beyondcancer
Speaking at Britain Against Cancer today. Want England to be among best in Europe in treating cancer and supporting survivors #beyondcancer
Regulation: a hindrance as well as a help? Thinking about how we can make sure it isn't a burden and still keep patients safe
It cannot be right that the 5 year survival rate for colorectal cancer varies between areas - 68% in the highest and 40% in the lowest
Here is my xmas memory - putting a bowl of flour on top of my door to find out who Santa was by giving him a big shock! #xmas2remember
Remember those with #dementia this Christmas. Visit the Christmas memories blog http://t.co/KnWeife9 & tweet a memory using #xmas2remember
Thinking aloud this morning about the courage and compassion in care that can’t be measured, only celebrated.
Only 2% of GP appointments are currently booked online although 20% of people say they would like to do so
Well done @DrFosterIntel. We now need clear, simple, transparent information on quality of care as well as quality of treatment.
Thousands of people are living with HIV and don't know it. I urge people to get tested for HIV this week for #WorldAIDSDay
@AnnabelAllum which email are u using Annabel?

Just had meeting on dementia research - crucial to focus on holistic approach including Cause, Care & Cure
Congratulations to the A3 Hindhead team @transportgovuk - winners of a Civil Service Award for the superb A3 tunnel in my constituency
Just met an inspiring group of CCG and primary care leaders @nhsalliance conference. Much enthusiasm and ambition for improvement.
Fantastic to speak at Dementia Action Alliance conf this morning&champion the #dementiachallenge Audience passion and enthusiasm inspiring
2/3 of people in care homes&1/4 of people in hospital have dementia but does their care constitute a big enough part of inspection regimes?
Busy morning to flesh out our long term vision for a paperless NHS. Can we have a health and care system that is digital by default?
if England's lung cancer survival rates were as good as the best in Europe, we could save 1,300 additional lives per year.
Patients waiting longer than 52 weeks to start treatment hits new record low, latest stats show.Great achievement by NHS staff #nhswaits
Thanks@Age_UK for great conference in National Self Care Week.Technology can reduce A&E admissions by 20%&mortality by 40%, total no brainer

Great to hear from Jennifer Dixon @nuffieldtrust yesterday about technology helping to foster innovation and improve quality
Spent meeting looking at mortality data by area and how to make sensible comparisons accounting for different demographics
What's the difference between forgetfulness and early dementia? Just had meeting exploring whether online self-testing can help people know
Angela Rippon has just told me about work in B'ham on dementia to improve care&save millions. Great progress by #dementiachallenge champions
Just had meeting on reducing mortality rates, some of the most affluent areas not up to the European best
Shockingly poor awareness of dementia perists. Great to have @alzheimerssoc on board - lets change attitudes and end stigma
How much GP time could be freed up if more people ordered prescriptions online? Have asked my dept to find out.
Good meeting with CQC on driving up care standards - Winterbourne View very much on our mind @CareQualityComm
In Norwich trying to understand why dementia diagnosis rates so low. Feels like stigma around condition where cancer was 30 yrs ago
Thanks Norman Williams @RCS_SurgeryNews. Look forward to working together to tackle variation of performance in the five big killer diseases
Just met @profChrisHam and @DrAnna Dixon, excited by the opportunity to make better information the "engine" of high quality care
Just been on inspirational visit to UCLH MacMillian Cancer Centre. Courage and optimism of cancer patients as ever truly inspirational.
@ABurns1907 Really useful discussion on dementia diagnosis&what we can do. Still can't believe diagnosis rates as low as 29% in some areas
Met @FarrarMike today, great to hear his ideas on both information and care improvement
Why are cancer survival rates below the European average? We need to do better.
Welcome to my first Dept Health tweet. Busy morning looking at improving mortality rates for big killer diseases.

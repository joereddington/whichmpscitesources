Ipswich A & E rated outstanding & I can see why. Congrats 2 commuted staff & @ben4ipswich 4 campaign for heart unit http://t.co/ZiiPSwR6UD Mon Apr 20 11:51:06 BST 2015
Sturgeon should heed Greece, Portugal & Italy if she wants to increase NHS spending: they cut health spend because they crashed the economy Mon Apr 20 11:27:08 BST 2015
Sturgeon's shopping list grows ever larger: just like our national debt would under a Miliband-SNP alliance. #snpmanifesto Mon Apr 20 11:23:44 BST 2015
Terrifying to hear SNP fantasy economics that would be unleashed on UK under a Miliband gov: how can increasing the deficit bring down debt? Mon Apr 20 11:20:26 BST 2015
Sturgeon's 'promise' to ppl in Eng, Wales & NI: more spending, more taxes, more borrowing for you & your family. Scary stuff. #snpmanifesto Mon Apr 20 11:13:47 BST 2015
I warned NHS not to repeat BBC mistakes on high pay, & tackled worst abuses of Lab's system. Clearly more to do: http://t.co/9VgosK4J8Y Mon Apr 20 11:06:26 BST 2015
Concerned by Mail pay story: running a hospital is a tough job, but high salaries only justifiable where results 4 patients are exceptional Mon Apr 20 10:48:27 BST 2015
Bizarre Labour campaign today: they claim NHS is on life support yet still the only party to refuse to fund the £8bn NHS says it needs. Mon Apr 20 10:30:00 BST 2015
Finally on this: who upped hospital nurses by 8000?Conservatives. Who left hospitals wth short-staffed wards/Mid Staffs? Lab. No lessons pls Sun Apr 19 11:00:38 BST 2015

.@andyburnhammp then why did this Govt find £2bn for NHS frontline NEXT YEAR in Autumn Statement that Lab neither planned or budgeted for? Tue Apr 14 10:14:30 BST 2015
.@andyburnhammp NHS needs a Gov to back & fund their own 5 year plan. Sadly they can't rely on Labour for either: http://t.co/RyfkPr62bZ Tue Apr 14 10:13:01 BST 2015
Astonishing that @andyburnhammp not backing NHS 5 year plan: does he really think he knows better than all the national NHS bodies combined? Tue Apr 14 10:08:52 BST 2015
Visiting @MulberryCentre with @MaryMacleod2015 seeing inspirational work for cancer sufferers http://t.co/zcPE7m6xL0 Mon Apr 13 16:58:34 BST 2015
Lab manifesto:'everyone must learn lessons' when things like Mid Staffs go wrong. Incl ministers resp 4 Lab's targets culture? Same old Lab Mon Apr 13 12:46:44 BST 2015
Confirmed: Lab will abandon the NHS plan &won't give it the funding it needs. That's what happens when you have no plan for a strong economy Mon Apr 13 11:43:52 BST 2015
Astonishing Labour health manifesto doesn’t mention NHS’ 5 yr plan; not just refusing to fund it but ripping it up too. Mon Apr 13 11:35:20 BST 2015
Ed Balls confirmed on #r4today he won’t fund NHS plan. Will be worrying for NHS leaders relying on Gov to do their bit to secure NHS’ future Mon Apr 13 11:34:51 BST 2015
Here's a reminder of the difference that a strong economy makes to the NHS: http://t.co/azHMAD2u2e Mon Apr 13 11:29:14 BST 2015
Here's what Miliband forgot to mention  on NHS 'privatisation': http://t.co/CBe6hMtkJ8 Mon Apr 13 11:26:21 BST 2015
Miliband calls his £2.5bn pledge 'a fully funded plan'.  Think you'll find the NHS disagrees Ed.  They say they need £8bn. Mon Apr 13 11:24:30 BST 2015
Labour still don't get it: no point talking about strong public services if you can't create the jobs that pay the taxes to fund them. Mon Apr 13 11:23:12 BST 2015
With @cmackinlay campaigning in South Thanet. Good visit to local GP and Age Concern. Warm & engaging candidate! http://t.co/IPAx5cbUZj Mon Apr 13 11:19:10 BST 2015
Labour promised 'no more borrowing' in their 1997 manifesto...that pledge ended with largest deficit in peacetime history. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:17:59 BST 2015
Miliband says Britain succeeds 'when hospitals aren't cut back to the bone.'  Agreed.  So where's the £8bn pledge for the NHS' 5 year plan? Mon Apr 13 11:15:55 BST 2015
Ed Miliband confirms they won't pay for NHS plan: simple truth is they can't grow the economy so they can't fund the NHS. #LabourManifesto Mon Apr 13 11:13:08 BST 2015
Great weekend canvassing in North Farnham, tremendous enthusiasm amongst my local team http://t.co/b094EkoL5R Sun Apr 12 15:19:05 BST 2015
@andyburnhammp no correct parallel with 2010 is that once again Lab planning to go into election spending less on NHS than Conservatives Sun Apr 12 10:40:52 BST 2015
Sad that Labour has dumped the NHS's own plan for reform, the 5 Year Forward View. Labour won't fund it and no mention in their manifesto. Sat Apr 11 15:45:07 BST 2015
Labour talk big but invest less on the NHS: http://t.co/IErO5tE1fq Sat Apr 11 12:49:24 BST 2015
Big moment for the NHS today as we commit £8bn for their plan.  An economy creating 1000 jobs a day can fund great public services. Sat Apr 11 12:48:06 BST 2015

Danger of pol football debate is we lose focus on patients, quality &  demographic challenges. @andyburnhammp, we need a better NHS debate. Wed Apr 08 11:26:47 BST 2015
It’s day 10 of the campaign & already @LabourHealth have put out dodgy GP stats, false privatisation claims & lies on Tory spending plans. Wed Apr 08 11:24:57 BST 2015

@jappleby123 DH finance will confirm those figures John Tue Apr 07 14:52:47 BST 2015
A&E weaponising is wearing thin.Scotland, NI & Lab-run Wales all WORSE than England; how can Labour justify making A&E a political football? Tue Apr 07 12:33:40 BST 2015
.@LabourHealth hypocrisy knows no bounds: they call 93.6% A&E performance in Eng a crisis; yet service they run in Wales only manages 83.8%. Tue Apr 07 10:33:48 BST 2015
A&E facts: in face of unprecedented demand, NHS saw 9/10 patients in less than 4 hrs - best performance in UK and world. Tue Apr 07 10:32:17 BST 2015
@LabourList Is poster picture of docs & nurses who'd be laid off if Lab ruined economy again? 9k more docs 7k more nurses under coalition Tue Apr 07 09:45:37 BST 2015
@LabourHealth @jreedmp @andyburnhammp so why did Labour remove it in Wales? Tue Apr 07 09:36:13 BST 2015
.@andyburnhammp's GP figures incorrect& outdated. Let's have a robust NHS debate, but let's make sure it's based on fact not scaremongering. Tue Apr 07 09:32:37 BST 2015
Unbelievable Lab hypocrisy on GP access: in Wales they scrapped the 48 hr appointment target they now want for England Tue Apr 07 09:04:25 BST 2015

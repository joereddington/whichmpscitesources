@tomsheppard @wrightben Tory PM promised a vote on EAW before R&S by-election.Tory whips worried they might lose so Gov trying to avoid vote
.@LibDems keep up, the Tories are doing their best to ensure we do not get a vote on the EAW

@MikeLister66 @BBCDevon The position doesn't belong 2 the Tories in the event of them forcing one of their own 2 resign & cause a byelection
@MikeLister66 @torbaymayor @BBCDevon It was only the vote of confidence by Tory Cllrs that made him consider resigning
@MikeLister66 @BBCDevon The fuss is whether he can still count on the support of at least 12 Tory Cllrs to avoid being a lame duck Mayor
@MikeLister66 @torbaymayor @BBCDevon The Lib Dems didn't and don't have the power to remove him as Leader of the Tory Group Mike
@MikeLister66 @BBCDevon Most elected Mayors do not lead their political group on the council-It's about total control
@MikeLister66 @BBCDevon @radiowoodley He's still the Tory candidate Mike - listen to the interview.
@BBCDevon @radiowoodley A truly remarkable car crash interview but it's his Tory councillors who have brought it to this-200 days to 7th May
@JennyKumah @BBCDevon He's right on this-it's the people who should vote him out not a small cabal of Tory Cllrs. Only 200 days to 7th May
What further services are the Tories going to cut to pay for the by-election their impatience with @torbaymayor may cause? @BBCDevon
@MikeLister66  Another example of @Torbay_Council wanting something from Government but failing to involve the MPs 2/2
@MikeLister66 Apparently there is an idea to allow these vehicles to be tested in three cities but 1st I've heard of it 1/2
@JennyKumah @BBCDevon To lose one Tory Mayor though deselection was unfortunate, to sack a second looks like carelessness
.@SaintSwith @TQHeraldExpress So long as he has the support of 12 Cllrs he still holds all the power-Time more Cons thought about joining us
@TinaCrowson @TQHeraldExpress Looking forward to seeing @SteveParrock behind a horse driving a carriage?

@CallingEngland @TQHeraldExpress Churston Common isn't in the Torbay Parliamentary Constituency
Three questions for the elected Mayor https://t.co/FPlsTFBOdB
@LisWarren Will do.
Wow !!! According to the number crunchers the record numbers in tonight's Tweetchat #ourD  mean we potentially reached 199,000 people - Gulp
The APPG #Diabetes is a great chance to get our voices heard.Give us a final quote at https://t.co/2FxTzRFbBy 3/3
Particular thanks to #ourD  @JDRFUK @DiabetesUK and the people who make things happen within them 2/3
Thank you to everyone who has taken part - please invite your MP to the next APPG meeting on Sept 10 at 3pm 1/3
@bad_diabetic  Perhaps @JDRFUK should start a dating service! #ourD
Q4 How confident do you feel that you know what diabetes education and support is available to you - both locally and nationally? #ourD
@owlette22 @parthaskar @ninjabetic1 Interesting, anyone know of a good area with convenient education times? #ourD
@benpmoody @diabeticbanana He's just explained it to me:)- #ourD
Q3 How should education and support best be delivered and by who? #ourD
@benpmoody who is @diabeticbanana ? Great name. #ourD
@ninjabetic1 Very important point IMO #ourD
@owlette22 @OurDiabetes Absolutely #ourD
@Mattreesjdrf @JDRFUK @le3ky That is a real worry. Have you raised this with your local health providers or your MP? #ourD
@parthaskar Thank you. #ourD
@sallyrose_ @JDRFUK @le3ky What was your experience - too much or too little information? #ourD
Q2 What gaps are there in the current provision of education? What other training & support would U or your family find useful? #ourD
@le3ky Wonder if anyone has more recent experience of diagnosis as an adult or child? #ourD
@OurDiabetes @tommyb0711 I agree Peer advice nearly always helpful #ourD
@le3ky What support or training did you get at diagnosis - too little/too much? #ourD
First question - what do you currently look 4 advice & support to help U manage your D? #ourD
The all party group (APPG) I chair tries to raise the profile of diabetes in parliament so your views will help #ourD
Hi everyone and welcome to #ourD Adrian here, Type1 for 25 years and managing live as an MP

@life_of_kevin So no evidence, just your opinion.  Suppose you don't believe the Government is acting on 0hr abuse http://t.co/3dxG46mkVj
@coraltone Since the announcement of the funding of the by-pass unemployment has fallen month on month & faster than elsewhere in the county
@life_of_kevin Your evidence?
No surprise this time of year that unemployment's down on last month but claimant count is 687 lower than in July 2013 which is great news

@MikeLister66 @GardeningGolfer @timfarron Depends on the issue but more today given access to info than in the past
@GardeningGolfer @MikeLister66 @timfarron A re-elected MP self-evidently does.It's the electoral system that gives power to the whips'
@MikeLister66 @GardeningGolfer @timfarron That's not an argument about Mayors but the need for an electoral system that empowers voters
@GardeningGolfer @MikeLister66 @timfarron Independents can B the very worst-extremists the main parties would never put up, or their rejects
@MikeLister66 @GardeningGolfer @timfarron I agree, your vote only elects a person to represent you & all they offer you is their judgement
@MikeLister66 If- @timfarron -the national party pulls it finger out we might present a mayoral candidate who has advised FTSE100 companies
@MikeLister66 @timfarron It's everyone's problem when fewer people hold the elected to account and engage with decisions
@MikeLister66 @timfarron Very few chose 2 vote & what is this vision that allows 1 person 2 tax the poor & vulnerable & cut their services?
@timfarron @MikeLister66 You could ask! I always favour more people in decision making than concentrating power in the hands of one

.@GrumpyDevonian @kevin_j_foster @NickBonstow @AlisonHernandez Torbay Tories biggest losers tonight and now UKIP likely to target the seat
.@ibrickUK we came third in Torbay last time as today and 11 months later I doubled my majority, but I'm not complacent
.@Patsindevon @darrencowell Labour -1.6% on last Euro election in Torbay - we were down to - Tories down the most.
.@darrencowell your party's vote fell across Torbay and it remains in 4th place and out of the race even with Brixham included!
@Torbay_Hour @bbchamish @BBCSpotlight Be great 4 the bay from election coverage if it was but as a Leader he'll want a seat closer to London
.@bbchamish @BBCSpotlight Same positions as 2009 but big swing Con to UKIP that should make Torbay a firm UKIP target
@NickBonstow @AlisonHernandez @kevin_j_foster Very happy in fact, but not at all complacent.Will welcome UKIP's decision to target the seat
@CllrNigelAshton Gibraltar a better bet - Lib Dems topped the poll there in the SW & Gib seat.
@wrightben got one in Torbay - could be a two horse race between UKIP and me!  Certainly be telling Tories to vote UKIP if they want me out.
@BobConstantine Tories down 4.3 % on 2009 Lib Dems down 3.1%. One of the better LD results despite only 70% of seat in Torbay constituency.
@BobConstantine Looks like big swing Tory to UKIP in Torbay (includes Totnes constituency wards) LD retain 3rd place.
@naomimilward41 Congratulations.
@HJMacManus @SkyNewsPolitics No, I've never been a 100% behind any leader. You can read my views here: http://t.co/vM0DcUJaOJ

@Edward_Duncan @colingale @GlynLey @SimplyJenkins I simply disagree & do not underestimate the unhappiness within the other parties
@Edward_Duncan @colingale @GlynLey @SimplyJenkins Big risk giving up their ministerial posts and government cars-can't see that I'm afraid
@Edward_Duncan @colingale @GlynLey @SimplyJenkins Why will the coalition have collapsed?
@Edward_Duncan @colingale @GlynLey @SimplyJenkins Might not have to.It's how do we regain trust so our mostly good message is heard
@wyattd @franksobey Who wouldn't!
@colingale @GlynLey @SimplyJenkins My loyalty is to values and principles Colin, leaders come and go.
Bear with, but how come Torquay born Miranda plays for Atl Madrid and not the Gulls? @mermhart
@GlynLey @SimplyJenkins Think Ros Keyes, West Dorset, got there first. Expect more to follow.
@tomsheppard For Ronald that is.  And it's the Gulls - Brighton are the seagulls.
@tomsheppard Too much of a step up I fear.
This Ronald Aldo looks a bit special.  One for Man U perhaps.
@tomsheppard @okayalison I'm sure she will understand a house and two career moves will be much easier than you signing up to Facebook
@tomsheppard You could move.
@tomsheppard I don't think so unless I post on my website as well.Sorry, but facebook is much better for feedback from constituents than web
There may be trouble ahead https://t.co/mH5AE4xkTH …
@_DaisyBenson Knackered like everyone but don't see it as inevitable to lose heavily when governing - Tories 83/87, Labour 01/05

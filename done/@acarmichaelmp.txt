@MarkPJSmith @sl_press Thanks Mark. They were a great bunch and I really enjoyed meeting them.
@oneexwidow @macmillancancer @highlandpark Worry not - they will be back up again next month!

@NickThornsby @paultrollope @richardmarbrow That is why I am chief whip. Or maybe it is BECAUSE I am chief whip that I turn to whisky....
@Weltpolitik Hmmm.  Not sure.  Smacks a bit of clinging to a colonial past.
@NickThornsby @paultrollope @richardmarbrow Personally I cut straight to the wine. If a 2nd stage is required l8r then maybe Highland Park
@paultrollope @nickthornsby I am with @richardmarbrow on this one. I had exactly the same thought! Does that make me a philosopher? Discuss
@Weltpolitik to be honest I never really thought about it! I can see quite a few practical problems.
@Weltpolitik The easiest way is to fly to Aberdeen or Edinburgh and then on the London flight. Not that difficult really ;-)
@tbugembe Really looking forward to being there. Not long now!
@tomgreatrexmp @agilinsky Can I just say that is much nicer than anything a Lib Dem MP has ever said about my role as Chief Whip?

@MootSoc Tragedy.  Who will tell the next generation of law students where the Court of Session sits? Does it ever move?
@bbclouise @vickiyoung01 Phone has been strangely silent.....
@DArcyTiP Deal done! In the meantime can you do something about the disgraceful editorialising on News 24? Not holding my breath!
@DArcyTiP More than happy to give you the real story about Lib Dem morale post-Eastleigh. None of your colleagues here are interested in it
@trevdick Thought that Tim handled the news 24 interview very well but it was still a disgraceful piece of editorialising.   Typical Beeb.
@BBCLouise @vickiyoung01 you can get my number from the Press Office.
@stephentall Particularly impressed by the very open-minded interviewing style.  Unbiased public service broadcasting at its best.
@DArcyTiP interesting prog but you won't progress in BBC if you don't have an item about Lib Dems in crisis. Have you not read the script?
@trevdick they clearly had the script written two weeks ago and are too lazy/biased/incompetent to write a new one.
@trevdick not for want of trying!
Not expecting to see any BBC journos at Lib Dem Conference this weekend. Obviously copy is already written. #lordreithturninginhisgrave
@Chugs84 maybe so but taking nothing for granted and EVERY vote counts.
Great response to the #bettertogether message on the streets and doorsteps of Kirkwall this morning.

@davepage_mcr can't wait to see it now. Intrigued.
@gordonlucas @nickinfairisle It IS exciting! I led 4 Lib Dems on civ partnerships bill & that felt right but technocratic. This feels right
@NickinFairIsle @gordonlucas Not a difficult one.  I shall be voting in favour of the bill.
@honladymark @stephenpglenn Prepare to be disappointed...
@CampbellGunn1 he did indeed. Nice to know he is prepared to admit it!
@CampbellGunn1 many years ago Jim Malcolm used to sing in the Gight House in Methlick where I worked. This tweet makes me feel a bit old!
@stephentall what is this about? DM me if necessary
@stephentall I find it hard to believe there is such a thing.
@michaelsavage Quite right & none of us does. It does mean that as long as you are a minister you find an acceptable compromise or resign.
@MirrorJames Sorry. Missed the obvious reply.  "Is that because Tesco are the ones flogging a dead horse?" #gettingslowinmyoldage
@MirrorJames Do they use the whole horse I wonder? The odd horse's head could be useful in the office....
@MirrorJames A bit harsh?
@MirrorJames is that burger as a starter or a mane course?
@richardmorrisuk @honladymark @timfarron Be afraid. Be very afraid.
@seandilley Good thanks. You getting to civilisation this festive period?
@WWPKC Thanks Willie we wanted it done by someone who knew him rather than a journalist working from clippings. Still struggle to believe it
@seandilley That is good. Should make it easier to afford the planes for them.

@kavya_kaushik second reading date still to be confirmed. Could be in January.
@EvidenceMatters @normanlamb Now you have lost me in a level of detail that is way beyond me.

Thinking tonight of my friend John Morrison. 140 characters cannot do him justice. Suffice it to say that he will not be forgotten.
@HighlandCraic Thanks for that. He was an usher at my wedding. So sad.
Major kudos to @EDI_Airport & @transportgovuk for pulling out the stops to get deliveries to Shetland today and tomorrow.
@bramblesmith @tavishscott Tesco pd 4 flight but Dept for Transport waived security regs at midnight to allow for loading at EDI.
@craigathomson Not unless I had definitely decided I was resigning and had another job to go to!
@portellenps Same to you. Hope 2013 is a good year for the school.
@craigathomson I think the word that really applies is "dangerous"
@EDI_Airport Any public affairs staff or management please contact me at home to discuss charter service to LSI. PM me for contact details.
@tomfooled Thanks. Was just a little worried that I did not have quite enough to do...
@MichaelAlcroft1 Indeed. Can't argue with that.
Beware anyone heading to Heathrow today, Heathrow Express suspended.
@MissSpidey @caronmlindsay Ah.  That makes sense. Worryingly.
@caronmlindsay @MissSpidey OK.  Not sure what you have been taking, Caron, but suggest you stop now and save the rest for me ;-)
@caronmlindsay @MissSpidey You might as well tell me as you know I will find out....
@caronmlindsay @MissSpidey Don't tell me what?
@NickinFairIsle Indeed. We must never take it for granted though. Have a good Christmas when it comes.
@NickinFairIsle Does it make you value Fair Isle even more?
@ChrisBramall Happy to do so although it will mean disestablishing CofE first.  That discriminates against my denomination.
@phil_reilly @pinknews That was taken just at 6.20am after the declaration in O&S in 2010. Sleep deprivation can do funny things to you.

@stephenpglenn @timfarron @mshapland @bubbalou @geekofhearts Good to see you have at least learned to spell it Mr Glenn
@timfarron @mshapland @bubbalou @geekofhearts That is the sort of harsh judgement I am prepared to live with!
@jcpieterman Hope to be in the chamber for part of the debate at least thou it depends on timing. Hoping to get home tomorrow night.
@MShapland @bubbalou @geekofhearts Glad to see you have acquired an enthusiasm for party discipline, Martin ;-)
@Callum_Leslie :-) nothing to apologise for tho best to try understanding each other's views and leave attacking Lib Dems to the Con/lab etc
@Callum_Leslie I would hope so but not everyone sees this as we do. That is where respect 4 minority views comes in. Also important 2 a lib
@Callum_Leslie It may be fundamental to why you are a Lib Dem but we have always tolerated different views on a wide range of issues.
@Callum_Leslie Remember this was not in the last manifesto. Consider also what a whipped vote actually involves under our standing orders.
@auntysarah @a_c_mcgregor Same could be said about the chief whip!
@A_C_McGregor @auntysarah Mike is presently recovering. Vote not likely to be until the new year. No date fixed yet.
@colingale indeed. Always important to respect different points of view. Important part of being a liberal.
@A_C_McGregor @auntysarah perfectly legitimate for party members now to ask. For the avoidance of doubt I am voting for!
@auntysarah @a_c_mcgregor Judge the decision at the end of the day by the outcome it delivers not the process it uses to get there
@oneexwidow I know that some MPs have very reasonable reservations. Whipping the vote would not change that.
@colingale Let me be quite clear. I will be voting in favour of the bill, free vote or not!
@IsabelHardman Basically yes. This keeps argument on the issue and not the process. We are strongest on the issue.
@zoeimogen @callum_leslie Sorry. Parliamentary Party Meeting
@Iain_33 Second reading (on the principle) will be a free vote. Other votes could still be whipped.
@oneexwidow happy to explain and will do so in more detail when I can but don't expect it on every vote!
@jzadrozny basically whipping it would  allow opponents to attack us for process because they are weak on the arguments.
@AllanHeron @callum_leslie Can't control press reporting but if we explain our own position honestly then less chance of misrepresentation
@jzadrozny difficult to explain these things in 140 characters. Is the position clear?
@Callum_Leslie No guarantee of 100% support on whipped vote either!
@jzadrozny did you see my tweet to Callum?
@AllanHeron @callum_leslie NB also free vote is on 2nd reading only. Other votes will be whipped unless a case for not doing can be made.
@Callum_Leslie No. Not what I said. Each one will decide for themselves. That is what a free vote means. Not expecting many to vote against
@AllanHeron @callum_leslie Previously only said there was a presumption of a whipped vote BT we wld decide when we had a bill. Done that.
@Callum_Leslie No LD MP spoke against equal marriage at PPM but overwhelmingly wanted 2 support it because they do not because they r told 2
@Callum_Leslie Happy to explain what we decided if you want to listen. Not much point otherwise
@Callum_Leslie feel free to ask before you comment.
@captain_europe No problem. Most illuminating. Happy to be associated with Scotland - in a good way ;-)
Just received a complaint from the Duracell Bunny. Apparently he is knackered trying to keep up with @julianhuppert today.#CCDP
@shanegreer Often said that when your opponent calls you a Nazi you have won the debate. This follows the same principle.
@stackee @AAEmmerson Inviting Peter seems like a jolly jape now but what if he turns up? #becarefulwhatyouwishfor
@AAEmmerson @stackee You make that sound like it could be a bad thing. #offtobed
@AAEmmerson @woodstockjag Probably as good a time as any ;-)
@LoyaulteMeLie @abjtal @stackee All innocent? Now you have me really worried!
@abjtal @stackee @LoyaulteMeLie Think it? I would know it!
@AAEmmerson @woodstockjag Pete Bone?  Wouldn't want to damage the mace #maceinacanmightbedifferent
@Callum_Leslie @woodstockjag @AAEmmerson Don't you worry about them.  That is my job!
@LoyaulteMeLie @stackee If my job was easy then we would have stopped being a liberal party so no. #mightbequiteniceoccasionally
@woodstockjag @AAEmmerson Shotgun, baseball bat. Not fussy really #whateveristohandandhurts
@stackee @LoyaulteMeLie Any way, delighted to find this enthusiasm for whipped votes and party discipline in Lib Dems! Makes my job easier!
@stackee @LoyaulteMeLie Me too though party stance not in doubt. What constitutes a conscience issue and a free vote can be a grey area.
@AAEmmerson Pleasure!  Sorry but not always easy to explain these things in 140 characters!
@stackee @LoyaulteMeLie Me too but I know some LD MPs have reservations. Those who oppose will not support justbecause it is a whipped vote.
@AAEmmerson @Scarletstand NB Article from May. Position still the same. Presumption is govt bill = whipped vote but not necessarily so.
@stackee @LoyaulteMeLie Decision still to be taken by PLDP. Whipped or not I would expect most LD MPs to support it.
@carmichae2 Dear God. My own son now calling me chief. What have I done?
@AAEmmerson @Scarletstand Even if there were a free vote on parts there would need to be whip on other parts eg programme motion etc.
@AAEmmerson 2b decided by PLDP. No decision yet taken. Don't know who @Scarletstand has been listening to but they are speculating at  best
@carmichae2 Should your mother and I adopt the same approach? #I'mdreamingofacheapchristmas
@whassigo It started with a tweet and ended with a messy restraining order...
@lordbonkers @mike_fabricant @mhepemberton Stop it now! This is in danger of getting silly.... Oops! Too late.
@Mike_Fabricant @mhepemberton Damn! I should have guessed...
@Mike_Fabricant @mhepemberton Great Tweet. I had no idea there was such a thing! I wonder, is the sodomite union affiliated to the TUC?
@caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee I know that although I can understand why you would be excited at seeing me in person.
@caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee @stephentall @jpshaddock @adlibmag Of course. Been missing me ?
“@carmichae2: If prunes are dehydrated plums, where does prune juice come from?... — The tears of sad prunes? http://t.co/TcnJAcYF” So proud
Alex Salmond refers to a great year for Scottish sport without using the word "Scolympians". Wonder why..... #cringeworthy
@phil_reilly Indeed and you will not be the last if I have my way.
I think I can just about put up with the music but the constant emoting by the judges is beginning to get to me #XFactor
@stephentall @caronmlindsay @jpshaddock @ryancoetzee @adlibmag Is that a bad thing? #seenalotworse
@phil_reilly Can't be that bad if you can still tweet about it #manup
@caronmlindsay @jpshaddock @ryancoetzee @stephentall @adlibmag sorry didn't have room for the hashtag #itsokifitsshaddock
@caronmlindsay @jpshaddock @ryancoetzee @stephentall @adlibmag Can't you tell the difference between casual brutality and bitchiness?
@HighlandCraic @jameskirkup Spot on.
@jpshaddock @caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee @stephentall @adlibmag let's not get ahead of ourselves here.  You got a girlfriend yet, Shaddock?
@jameskirkup Is that why it is so important to keep the receipts? So you can send them back?
@caronmlindsay @jpshaddock @ryancoetzee @stephentall @adlibmag No one who behaves has anything to fear. #goldenrule
@jpshaddock @caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee @stephentall @adlibmag No one should think I am not commenting because I have not seen this #1984
@AndrewSNicoll I hope you appreciate that I am now following these fools so I can leave them in protest at this treachery #highmaintenance
Busy day in Shetland. Everyone talking about the prospect of a ferry strike b4 Christmas. Hoping Scottish govt will get a grip and sort it.
@abjtal Not a fan of fish?!!!! Let me go and lie down in a dark room to think about that one...
@AndrewSNicoll Yep. Lady Wallace (unlike her husband) votes for me. That wins special privileges.
@abjtal it is a smoked haddock and potato soup. Delicious
World class Cullen Skink from @peerieshopcafe for lunch. Sets you up for the afternoon!
2nd #FF for @AndrewSNicoll author of #theloveanddeathofcaterina Another literary triumph. Go on - treat yourself #12daysofchristmasinbooks
@EvidenceMatters No! Not sung a note in anger for many years now!
#FF for @WallaceRosie whose second novel #thetroublewithkeepingmum is out in paperback.  A stonkingly fine read.
http://t.co/F2BWmw05 Rosie Wallace's latest now out in paperback. Buy it. That is all.

Disappointed to hear EU-Norway fisheries talks deadlocked.  Not good for fishing industry and not good for fish stocks.
@tnewtondunn It was probably one of the most unprofessional pieces of broadcasting I have ever heard. A real personal dislike can across.
House of Commons debating fishing industry in Westminster Hall. Well-attended and well-informed debate ahead of December Fisheries Council
@NickyMorgan01 And very well-attended good debate on fishing in Westminster Hall!
@jameslk57 Sorry - 140 character limit makes it difficult to discuss this without souinding trite!
@jameslk57 I am always wary of Countries making "gestures" in complex conflicts like this. Violence will never resolve this - dialogue will
@jameslk57 Agree about how inhuman treatment of Palestinians can get justified and ignored. Have visited W Bank & Gaza - Gaza esp grim
@jameslk57 Not sure what withdrawing British Ambassador achieves other than making dialogue even more difficult than it is at present.
@jameslk57 Israeli settlement plans are in danger of making a two state solution unachievable ever. No 2 state solution means no peace.
@SMIRKINK Guilty as charged M'Lud. Ask for 386 similar offences to be taken into consideration.
Met Office has a yellow alert for snow in Orkney and Shetland. Hopefully different from an alert for yellow snow #watchoutwherethehuskiesgo
@holyroodmandy  If I were still in the job of advising clients of what is a good defence I might want a little more #courtofpublicopinion
@holyroodmandy @HolyroodDaily Surely the sensible journalist should be working on defining a public interest defence.
@holyroodmandy @HolyroodDaily Leveson expressly excludes politicians from the regulator. Media setting up that aunt sally make me suspicious
@Sean_Kemp @jameschappers Bizarre. Will never understand English law. You guys need a good principle-based system. #it'salldefamation
@AlbertoNardelli He is a highly talented guy. Quite capable of doing both at once. #leadingbyexample
@jameschappers I am no expert on English law but I would expect it at best to be slanderous. Can think of at least one defence worth running
@whassigo We broadcast simultaneously this morning. On my way to do GMS at 7.35. To be heard by all of Scotland except my own constituents
@KGSModStudies Of course. Do we have a date fixed? Should know but my staff have blocked me from using my own diary.
@KGSModStudies if pressed I say it is like the man in the circus who follows the elephants with the bucket and shovel ;-)
@KGSModStudies @willie_rennie On the other hand I am also his deputy leader #toomanyhats
@phil_reilly @hvklav that is about 19,999,900 more than Orkney. #treesalonedonotbeautymake
@KGSModStudies Can't answer for the others but @willie_rennie will if he knows what's good for him *menacing grin*
@phil_reilly @hvklav much like Orkney!
@BruceHenderson2 No arguing with that! Though not holding my breath waiting for it either #mailonsundayfrontpage
@phil_reilly so what is it about working for the Lib Dems that makes you worry about being unpopular ?
@vesternor Sounds like a plan. May be my naïveté but I assume that constituents who look big and clever are. That way I don't offend :-)
@BruceHenderson2 Mostly courts decide.Some privileged (MPs, press, lawyers) have been allowed self-reg.  When abused ind reg is needed
@BruceHenderson2 To be fair I could have a discussion on the philosophy of that but not in 140 characters! Consider legal privilege...
@giles_fraser The most beautiful city?   Bit like being the tallest dwarf maybe?  Orkney is looking pretty fine this morning.
@BruceHenderson2 Indeed though not sure what professional Human Rights are. Always regard myself as a highly gifted amateur in the field.
@schofieldkevin Same Shami Chakrabti that is praised in the Mail? Am going back to bed. Can someone pls fix the world before I get back up?
Mail praising Shami Chakrabati for opposing Leveson because (she says) it breaches ECHR. A mille feuille of irony.  http://t.co/b74fAchD
@vesternor Can you also indicate are you suggesting that the different strains should be treated differently?
@KGSModStudies Remind me when I am in and we can discuss this in a bit more than 140 characters!
@KGSModStudies Depends what you regard as important! Most important imho is taxation - fixes what is available to spend. That mostly W/mster
@vesternor @PoisonPopcorn Apols shld have acknowledged.  Twitter not good for issues like this. Can you email on carmichaela@parliament.uk ?
@caronmlindsay Steady! Let's not get carried away here.
Peter Bone may have just cemented the position of the double statement in parliamentary procedure. Well done that man.
@benglaze @dpmoffice I have hopes one day of hitting the dizzy heights of PPS
@whassigo You are too patient!
@richardclein @LordRennard @wishfullythinks Let me see what I can do about that....
@Yr_Hen_Ogledd @AGilinsky @MVSherer With communism the state buys everyone an iPad that connects to one approved site, then stops working
@richardclein @LordRennard @wishfullythinks Or anywhere else come to that?  She is actually gone, right?  This is safe?
@LordRennard @wishfullythinks When Sheila starts to save on her phone bills watch out for a crisis in British telecoms.
@jpshaddock when you say it like that it sounds like that is the only reason.
@JGurling Another sound choice :-)
@JGurling Glad to hear it. Think Andrew especially is an excellent chair. Who is being husted for VC2?
@DNewtonCook @libdempress Quite right. Sorry. Bygones.
@wishfullythinks @lordbonkers So you still don't get the reference ;-)
@wishfullythinks @lordbonkers Not too young but clearly just not watching the right movies. Think Michael Caine and minis
@GregPieCook @mrharrycole I am more of a traditionalist #ifitIsn'thurting
@CllrMCurtis As it ought to be ;-) #coalitionnotamarriage
@oflynnexpress I just asked her, says she would rather poke her own eyes out with a safety pin than join Labour. Clear enough?
@julianhuppert Have you not learned by now that I am much more likely to see red than black or white? #musttryharder
@matto763 It is her way of asking you to eat them.  Important in any relationship to be able to read the signals, I find.
@julianhuppert When I opened the link the picture of the tartan was just a plain white box.  Quite appropriate really.
@ayestotheright No. He has not had for the last couple of years.
@flyinglawyer73 @carolinepidgeon Absolutely. That is the answer but if they insist on establishment and discrimination.....
@MaggieMac42 Agreed so they shouldn't be nominating members of the Lords. As long as they do it should  be on the same basis as the rest
@HighlandCraic Nicely reminded!
@HighlandCraic Good question! Try reforming the House of Lords to find out the answer! Never made sense to my Presbyterian mind.
No political party would be allowed to appoint members of House of Lords on a men-only basis. Why should the CoE?
@caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee Thanks but not much comfort really!
@caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee Off to bed. I am in a world of trouble when the press office see this.
@caronmlindsay @ryancoetzee If it is 50 shades of yellow shouldn't you have Willie on every leaflet? Or maybe I have misunderstood....
@whassigo @rachelmassie1 All that and more. If you need the floor sweeping.....
@NanJarvie @alstewitn @ayestotheright @staggeredhermit A pedant or just a man with standards? OK. A pedant.
@RyanCoetzee think of some of the people who work there and ask yourself if you would want to be without them
@RachelMassie1 Yes.
@ayestotheright All part of the service #unapologeticpedantry
@ayestotheright I think you will find that should be "fewer" not "less". Just saying
Always forget to do Follow Fridays so doing it today instead #FF +48hrs for my big sister's awesome 5 star project @coillabus Pls RT

@RaviSubbie actually it was a joke. Look it up in the dictionary or try Google.
@RaviSubbie Congratulations. Another great example of Labour good grace and humour.
Low voter turnout not good but on the upside the voters rejected Michael Mates & John Prescott so there must be some hope for democracy
@markpack You mean that in a good way, right?
@wishfullythinks just a bit of twitter banter about press officers being whipped ;-)
@tzenni You know the rule.  We never comment on whipping matters ;-)
Making the press office nervous.  Now THAT is something that money can't buy.
@phil_reilly You wish!  @RyanCoetzee @stephentall @markpack #fantasiesbestnotsharedinpublic
@phil_reilly @RyanCoetzee @stephentall The correct answer to @markpack is "how much are you offering?"
Have I missed something? @phil_reilly did the party suddenly get so rich that we turn down donations?@RyanCoetzee @markpack @stephentall
@MShapland Not rejected out of hand but open to discussing a free transfer.   Got half a dozen or so that I am prepared to put in the mix.
You have to think that if voting for Tories was this much fun in normal circumstances Scotland would have more than one Tory MP. #ImACeleb
I just voted for Casino Feet http://t.co/cmWCGb3A #pathways via @youngscot
@Anth0ny_Gale All part of the service. Remember - we are whips because we care.
@whassigo I think it is an idea worth considering.  I shall consult the other chief whips about who we might nominate for the pilot scheme.
@ProfSlizzard @Mike_Fabricant With the prestige you would normally associate with third deputy cat herder in chief - but I love it....
@Mike_Fabricant @chrisbryantmp @_adam_price As you know I am ambitious but I know my limitations and would never dream of copying you!
@johnmullinios Only to keep within the 140 character limit of course! No other reason ;-)
@Iain_31 @jreedmp You have to be understanding. Coalition takes them out of their depth.
@crg121 I might but is that a decent way for any living animal to end its days? I think not.
@GrahaemeP @mackemlad888 @nadinedorriesmp Nope.
@jreedmp Sorry. Didn't mean to draw attention to Labour hypocrisy and opportunism on this issue.
@UseTheLeftWing Had not actually taken it as a chastisement. Is that a bad thing for a whip to say ?
@GrahaemeP @mackemlad888 @nadinedorriesmp Because I did not know it. Happy now?
@jreedmp Is that the same regional pay that Labour introduced ? Watch and learn
@UseTheLeftWing Yes and I would have said so if Lloyd Bentsen had understood the importance of the 140 character limit.
@jreedmp BTW it is a coalition not a conservative government. That is why Nadine dislikes it.
@jreedmp Might have been a good idea to say it then
Nadine Dorries, I served with Lembit Opik, I knew Lembit Opik, Let me tell you, Nadine Dorries, you are no Lembit Opik.
@lordbonkers said it before - satire is dead. Killed by reality.
@johnnylvg why, thank you.
@jreedmp There is a very long list of people that I support more than Nadine and, yes, the PM is on it.
@abjtal You know, it is just possible that for the first time ever I might want to watch it.
Good news - Nadine is off to the jungle. Bad news - the jungle has problems enough of its own and will send her back eventually.
@caronmlindsay depends if he won or not
@caronmlindsay @jpshaddock For the first time? Where have you been?
@caronmlindsay who is Kimi?
@caronmlindsay @stephentall It is supposed to be a big bit scary.
@stephentall I particularly liked him offering to tell me what was going on behind closed doors.If I find out who has been telling him...
@stackee @kavya_kaushik BTW awesome pic
@stackee @kavya_kaushik This means you have found your spiritual home! I have been in the party 32 years and never been depressed. Welcome!
@caronmlindsay Sadly not the absolute defence that it was in the day of the late Lord Reith.
@OllyGrender It would be nice to think that somebody could. Just saying.
@lordbonkers Oh dear. I often wondered what happened to the rest of Rinka's litter.
@lordbonkers @caronmlindsay Not just my job but also my passion ;-)
@caronmlindsay Language, Timothy!
@0h_starry_eyed Didn't notice it. I always wear a poppy but I guess that protecting the right to dissent is part of what they died for.
So @frankieboyle gave his damages award to Reprieve. Good man.
@AdamPritchard82 You contrarian, you.
@carmichae2 @andrewwwr @andypandymac Or psyched, even.
@gossig it is seriously hard work but worth it! The smell of singed turnip is up there with the smell of a peat fire! Also hard work.
@orkneypd Agree absolutely although we don't always get what we deserve in this life. In some cases this is lucky #carefulwhatyouwishfor
@orkneypd Watching closely, Ross, though always careful not to cross that line where following becomes stalking!
@gossig @indiaknight @hugorifkind I thoroughly approve of turnip lanterns even though my children prefer the easy carved pumpkins
@aligoldsworthy if it works then why not?
@aligoldsworthy if I had known I would have been there !
@gerry_4 @allanheron Not at all. Just live for the day when our own people might put some positives out there #hopelessoptimism
@AllanHeron OK - why don't you just ignore my point about us protecting money available for SNP to spend? That will really help the party
@AllanHeron Sure the SNP will be grateful to you for your support there, Alan. Read the whole agreement not just the headline
Of course re-organisation comes from NHS budget. That has no effect on money available to SNP for NHS
@Neil_Ford @gerry_4 SNP spend money on other things - their choice. They cut health as a result - their responsibility
@Neil_Ford @gerry_4 NHS budget is protected so if the SNP are now cutting here it is not because of cuts in block grant for health
@Stewart_Whyte @stvnews Fair point! It was one of the easier compromises to make :-)
@meljomur @gerry_4 we may never know but SNP chose a different route, now make cuts as a result but blame others.
@gerry_4 The amount going into NHS is not cut but protected and rises with inflation. Fact.
@docsuzy Indeed. When money is tight politics is about making choices and taking responsibility for them. SNP happy to do the former...
@kevin_lang @cajardine @caronmlindsay Get over it
@mikebell48 @gerry_4 sorry to let the facts get in the way of good spin. Probably suits SNP to talk about health today #diversionarytactics
@gerry_4 sorry Not looking for blind support. Would settle for not being undermined on the positives that we do have.
@gerry_4 I am proud that we protected NHS budget and will boast about it. Sorry you seem keener to help other parties than our own.
@CAJardine @caronmlindsay @kevin_lang @willie_rennie I have been called worse than either!
@kevin_lang @caronmlindsay @willie_rennie A missing apostrophe is an error of punctuation, not grammar. Just saying.
Coalition govt has maintained NHS budget in real terms so if SNP cutting health that is because of their choices.
@STVNews Sloppy journalism here. UK coalition has protected health budget in real terms so if SNP cutting it is because of their choices
@caronmlindsay @cajardine @gbarlowofficial I know the theory ..... :-)
@CAJardine @caronmlindsay @gbarlowofficial Nah! If the singers aren't entertaining then the judges have to be. High class banter
@Rummlins A country at ease with its Sc and GB identity using its parliament to protect its people and using UK voice for good in the world
@Rummlins in 140 characters? You don't want much! Will give it a go.
Difficult to believe that Salmond won't be called back to parliament to expain himself. In HoC Speaker would grant an urgent question
@rantingkat @Bubbalou The funniest whip? Hmmmm.  Bit like being the tallest dwarf.
As government stops badger cull a relieved looking Alistair Darling reappears in House of Commons.
Surprising news re @jeanurquhartsnp but understand it too. I don't agree with her on NATO but unlike SNP leadership I can respect her views
Glad to hear that all 19 passengers on CHC helicopter ditched between Orkney and Shetland have been rescued. Well done to all involved.
@Martin_Veart @alansm @ollygrender It's ok. As it happens rule number two applies here! #phewthat'slucky
@Martin_Veart @alansm @ollygrender Rule two is that rule one does not apply if the chief whip feels like it....
@OllyGrender Thanks but even the most enlightened whipping ops is best left unstudied! Remember the rule #wedontcommentonwhippingmatters
@paulwalteruk @gerry_4 @libdemvoice Actually it is not a hundred miles wide of the mark for me today! #toooldformidweeklatenights
Being in government can be difficult but sometimes it can be bloody brilliant too! #freegary
@JohnLoughton @Martin_Veart Get rubbing.
@JohnLoughton @daretolead @Martin_Veart Oversight, as it happens, but I think you will find I am worth the wait.
@MootSoc Sadly I have to be in London.Hope Hannibal lives up to the success of Freddie The Dolphin from 1991 http://t.co/L09jTcdv
A blast from my past - “@MootSoc: STAFF-STUDENT MOOT::: MONDAY 15th OCTOBER::: 6.30pm::: OLD SENATE ROOM”
@stephentall OK - I will bank that!
@stephentall Maybe not even that - they answered a question about how I do my job. How liked should a good chief whip be?  Discuss.
@stephentall Delighted I still attract a 63% Don't Know. As it ought to be. Would be interesting to know what the remaining 37% think I do
@ayestotheright Good to see @Jo_Adetunji keeping up Guardian traditions for accuracy #sloppyjournalism  #couldbeworsecouldbepollytoynbee
@StuartBonar They certainly are but I was not for taking chances.  lay flat on my back for about four hours just in case!
@NickinFairIsle BTW like the blog.
@NickinFairIsle Was not sorry to leave that boat in Orkney!  Apologies - recognition did not dawn until I had passed you last night!
@swilliamsmp @GregMulholland1 Sounds better than four hours lying on my back to avoid being sick in front of a boat full of constituents.
@Blancie and I am from Islay, have done this for 47 years now and never learned to like it. Looking forward to a bit of boredom...
@DavidNugent9 You ignore that we only need a plan because of the mess we inherited. Happy to take responsibility. Shame Labour won't
@DavidNugent9  Remember the words of Liam Byrne in his note to David Laws.
Dontcha love the way the whole ferry seems to shake when it hits a wave? No, me neither.
@swilliamsmp @gregmulholland1 glass of Shiraz on the ferry from Shetland to Orkney - 5 hrs in easterly gale to get home from office
@oflynnexpress Truce. Continuing this is going to make me sick-only because of the easterly gale I am sailing through, you understand ;-)
@oflynnexpress I don't think it is my sense of humour that is the issue here.
@vesternor That's the nicest thing anyone has said to me all week!
@markc1984 It will be fine I am sure. Forecast not great but it could be worse.
Feeling like it might be a slightly bumpy passage from Lerwick to Kirkwall tonight. Boat rolling a bit already #notevenpastsumburghyet
@oflynnexpress Mockery of speech defects - cutting edge satire. You must be very proud.
Interesting decision to give EU peace prize. No prizes for managing fish stocks #CFPfail
@jpshaddock Forgot to mention, I was made of the same stuff that they make the black boxes out of.
@jpshaddock I know all that but when you fly as much as I do you shorten the odds :)
@jpshaddock Thought it would be something like that. Even more glad that I did not watch it now!
@jpshaddock Didn't watch it for obvious reasons but why not seat 7A? It is the emergency exit seat on a Saab 340
@orkneypd @ofgem @oftgov Fair point. That has been the case for 11 years to my certain knowledge
Being followed now by @ofgem and @OFTgov Stick around guys. You have a lot to learn about the Northern Isles.
@cuynchips @gregmulholland1 Grim news indeed. Are @AmnestyUK on the case?
@libdemvoice @independent True but if you want to trash your party there can be few more fun ways to do it.
@PoisonPopcorn this is disturbingly good. I am just glad you are on my side!
@rantingkat @jpshaddock It is what I do #somebodyhastomaintainstandardsroundhere
@steve4319 @amnestyuk Thanks. The real stars are @AmnestyUK. They are indefatigable although best not to salute this quality in them.
@tnewtondunn @samcoatestimes This sounds vaguely disreputable but with Coates I am not surprised.
@jpshaddock @rantingkat And so it does but it is still no excuse for poor grammar.
A few thoughts from me on International Day Against the Death Penalty http://t.co/rhcaSVoR
@jpshaddock @rantingkat BTW the manager of any organic distellery (sic) in Orkney would need to learn not to split infinitives
@jpshaddock @rantingkat why organic? Is it possible to distill inorganically?
@PlanetDebster Afraid not. Too shy to ask :-)
Interesting that tweeting about Jedward produces a completely different range of retweets than usual. #notgoingtomakeahabitofit

@docsuzy Is it any easier to watch them on TV from your own living room?
@docsuzy True. Did it for a while. Same uncomfortable seating but the overwhelming heat of a swimming pool. Not sorry when they gave up.
@holyroodmandy Sounds like a grizzly error. *cough* I'll be going then.
@lordbonkers I think I prefer that name. Shall use it from now on.
In KGS for what could be the second last time I have to sit through a karate grading. #thehellofbeingaparent
@RuthDavidsonMSP Be careful. It is still only Sunday...... Just saying.
@holyroodmandy Are there many mods there?
@CharandeepS1ngh @amnestyscotland Thanks, Charandeep.  Enjoyed the evening a lot.  Let me know if I can ever help you with your campaign
@swilks123 @amnestyscotland The difference is that rape and abuse are not done by the state with the authority of the state.
@jimuck96 :-) I could write the book about the difficulties of getting in and out of Orkney. DM me if u have a specific I can help you with
@jimuck96 Spot on. Get transport links right and everything else will follow. Remember to have a go at your councillors re OF
@TMobileUKhelp I presume your title is ironic. I have spent an hour waiting for you to answer the phone to give me no help.
Great day in Fair Isle. Saw a good percentage if the local population. Useful surgery session. Got soaked. Bumpy takeoff going home.
@colingale I am good thanks. I too was once on the Exec of Banff and Buchan as it was then.  Happy days.
@colingale never assume - makes an ass of u and me. Point is about Patrick's handling not conspiracy theories that the decision creates!
Like Patrick MacLaughlin's style on Today Programme. No excuses and hiding nothing.
@kevin_lang @shetlandjen Noted, Mr Lang.  Not to be forgotten.  Even if I knew what the eye of Sauron was....
@MrAliDickinson @themoalition As long as it does not actually involve me growing a 'tache myself.
@ShetlandJen that's nice. My colleagues don't much like being followed by the chief whip but most of the time they do not know...
@LWFarmer not wrong exactly but perhaps a little premature in judgement. Long way to go yet
@lordbonkers I think you should get a lifetime achievement awards like they do at the Oscars. Just remember  to act surprised and cry
@MichaelLCrick Apologies. My life is a struggle with my inner pedant and he briefly got the upper hand there.
@MichaelLCrick I think you are missing a "more" in there.
@kevin_lang Straight as a dye (or maybe die - not sure tbh). Bright as a button. Get it right.
@acarmichaelmp @kavya_kaushik @scotlibdems How about making it a fundraiser for George Lyon's European Campaign in 2014?
@kavya_kaushik @scotlibdems Great idea and Congratulations!  You have just been elected chair of the organising committee.
@stackee @kavya_kaushik @chriswiggin TBH I did that in Paisley South 1987. Got me to within 15,000 votes of Labour!
@AGilinsky @kavya_kaushik from my observations I would say that the Tories may need to consider an upper age limit. Just saying.
@kavya_kaushik @chriswiggin this sounds a bit like child abuse. Await the 6am knock at the door from social workers.
@kavya_kaushik Sandy is. Simon still a little young for membership tho not too young to deliver leaflets!
@kavya_kaushik I don't mind. My sub is up to date.
This is the 199th anniversary of John Rae's birth. Great Orcadian who charted the last link in the North West Passage #unrecognisedheroes

Sad if not unexpected news about Malcolm Wickes. He was an intelligent minister with a nice dry, self-deprecating wit.
@PoisonPopcorn makes a change for the big society to go anywhere at all.
@kavya_kaushik If you are as posh as Nigella you must have someone to eat your food for you.
@richardkeane would love it but think I am speaking at a St Andrews Night dinner in Aberdeen #twoendsoftherockstarspectrum
@richardkeane life is good of hectic. Seeing wee Kim at an Amnesty gig in Glasgow next week. You likely to land in London any time soon?
@richardkeane Ah. Understood! Not averse to poncy coffee myself though in my world that usually means one with a bit of hot milk in it
@richardkeane Ebglish was a typo but somehow it works!
@richardkeane the words are all identifiably Ebglish but I have no idea what that tweet actually means ;-)
@tomfooled Welcome any time. Suggest you call before you come just in case we are out when you get here. Good to meet you at conference.
@Orkneycrafter Fortunately not a nervous flier. Would probably be in the wrong job if I were :-)
@Gus_Baldwin A genuine pleasure. Seen first hand some of what your people do. Always happy to contribute.
@PoisonPopcorn You may find there is not much competition for being my campaign manager so consider yourself hired (in a non-paid sense).
@PoisonPopcorn Can't hurt? You have obviously never heard me sing!

#ff for @caronmlindsay @MJCFife @kavya_kaushik @willie_rennie for conf fun & @jimuck96 for a classic tweet about monsters under his bed.
@orkneypd @whassigo @neilgray3 understood #canthesehashtagsgetanymoreridiculous
@PoisonPopcorn Ah. You got me there. Can't confirm leadership ambitions obviously but deny them and everyone thinks it is true.
@billiwilliams or that they are jealous that they never thought of pretending to fall asleep in order to get on the show ?
@PoisonPopcorn "Vote for me and I will give Harriet Harman root canal work without anaesthetic". Now THAT would be a winning slogan.
@kavya_kaushik Not even in the Labour Party does anyone care what Harriet Harman wants.
@kavya_kaushik I would rather have root canal work without anaesthetic than listen to Harriet Harman
@jimuck96 indeed but no rest for the wicked!

@NeilGray3 @whassigo Much the same  as you albeit 25 years on. Just celebrated silver wedding anniversary.
@NeilGray3 @whassigo Thx 4 congrats. Not sure it is a promotion! Reply also jest - that is what gets me in trouble. All good with you?
@NeilGray3 @whassigo Read the reply before you feed it to the cybernats !
@whassigo No apology necessary. Secretly a bit chuffed to have made onto Russell Howard's show.
@GdnPolitics Better late than never.
@whassigo It was NOT during his speech. That was merely the usual biased BBC editing. I was not sleeping, just concentrating very hard :-)
@richardclein @libdemvoice @caronmlindsay A great job to have but it will never match up to my days as membership secretary in Gordon!
@EvidenceMatters Why, thank you. I only wear it on special occasions really.

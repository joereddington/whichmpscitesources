80% of businesses in the Moorlands are small. We are determined to help them grow http://t.co/cnD5DNqmnM #VoteConservative Tue Apr 28 08:33:18 BST 2015
For excellent public services, you need a strong economy. Only the Conservatives will work with business to #SecureTheRecovery Tue Apr 28 08:20:03 BST 2015

Great morning campaigning in St Edward's Park. People in Cheddleton want us to #SecureTheRecovery Mon Apr 27 14:20:36 BST 2015
Labour's record leaves them with no credibility on immigration & they have no plan to reduce it now, refusing to talk about a target #BBCDP Mon Apr 27 14:19:41 BST 2015
We will aim to make Britain the best place in Europe to do business by 2020 #SecureTheRecovery #VoteConservative http://t.co/GH52MM2A2F Mon Apr 27 07:25:22 BST 2015

Ed Miliband suggested forming coalition government with SNP in 2010 - via @Telegraph http://t.co/JRbJC08mpk Sat Apr 25 13:04:55 BST 2015
These are our commitments to you. #VoteConservative for a brighter future http://t.co/ed7c7tK5hj Fri Apr 24 10:53:44 BST 2015
Really good response from Moorlands postal voters who choose competence over chaos #VoteConservative Fri Apr 24 09:28:26 BST 2015
@NicolaSturgeon If Tories are largest party after 7/5, will you agree w/ what @AlexSalmond said in Apr 07, we have right to form the gov't? Fri Apr 24 08:46:06 BST 2015
#Conservatives have more than halved the deficit. #Labour would rack up debt for you & your children to pay off. http://t.co/4CbskP5gWb Thu Apr 23 11:26:09 BST 2015
We know that Labour are addicted to spending your money. Now the IFS has confirmed they would increase debt by £90bn #VoteConservative Thu Apr 23 10:34:07 BST 2015
@jimallsop Hello there, please send an e-mail with your address details to votekaren@karenbradley.co.uk and I will send you a full response Thu Apr 23 09:45:24 BST 2015
The SNP claim funding Trident over 30 yrs is 'unsustainable', but want to increase spending elsewhere. #HavingCake #EatingItToo Wed Apr 22 13:23:14 BST 2015
#Conservatives want to reward aspiration & give ppl a hand up. Labour are ideologically committed to keeping poorest dependent on the state. Wed Apr 22 12:22:32 BST 2015
We will give people on low incomes #RightToBuy a home and stop those on minimum wage paying any income tax #RealPartyOfTheWorkers #VoteTory Wed Apr 22 12:17:56 BST 2015
We will give working parents 30hrs of free childcare a week, equivalent to £5k a year #VoteConservative http://t.co/RmRg0XWXXa Wed Apr 22 09:41:29 BST 2015

For those who are interested, listen out for my election feature on Radio Stoke tomorrow morning #VoteConservative Tue Apr 21 18:45:27 BST 2015
Labour can no longer claim to be the protector of the NHS. Good read from Ian Birrell http://t.co/INrL2VNcgR #VoteConservative #SaveOurNHS Tue Apr 21 08:33:52 BST 2015
Ed M can’t provide £8bn the NHS needs because he doesn't have an economic plan. No surprise from the man who advised Brown #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 20 20:40:20 BST 2015
60 million Brits can't vote for the SNP, but they will end up controlling our political agenda if Miliband enters No. 10. #VoteConservative Mon Apr 20 11:36:36 BST 2015
SNP don't want to be part of the UK, but they're happy to vote on issues that only affect England? #Hypocrisy http://t.co/IZZy1rSVCh Mon Apr 20 11:32:09 BST 2015
@uwont_findaleak Hi there, absolutely! Thanks for the offer - pls can you email votekaren@karenbradley.co.uk with your details & will sort! Mon Apr 20 09:27:20 BST 2015

Pleased that Lagarde of the IMF has admitted that it is "obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked” #LongTermEconomicPlan Fri Apr 17 10:00:04 BST 2015
So it's official: UKIP will 'do a deal' with Labour for a referendum. Go to bed with Farage and wake up with Miliband #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:33:46 BST 2015
Labour had thirteen years to show competence on immigration and they failed miserably #BBCDebate #SameOldLabour Thu Apr 16 21:17:22 BST 2015
More spending & taxing at the request of the SNP will lead to economic disaster & pit Scots & English against each other #BetterTogether Thu Apr 16 20:30:56 BST 2015
I'll be watching the #ChallengersDebate tonight to see if Ed will rule out any form of deal with the SNP. The UK is #BetterTogether Thu Apr 16 20:24:35 BST 2015

Leaving 2.5 million people unemployed isn't my idea of a joke, @edballsmp. #SameOldLabour #VoteConservative http://t.co/XBpo2DyvoV Thu Apr 16 11:46:18 BST 2015
We want a country where people are free to make choices & mistakes, to be generous & compassionate http://t.co/PA3naBfJ5H #MoreSecureFuture Thu Apr 16 10:21:03 BST 2015
It'd be nice to see Ed committing to the £30bn deficit reduction he voted for, too #ChallengersDebate #TaxAndSpendLabour Thu Apr 16 09:20:09 BST 2015
I hope that in tonight's #ChallengersDebate, Ed Miliband will come clean and tell us which taxes he is planning to raise #SameOldLabour Thu Apr 16 09:05:02 BST 2015
Great morning in Endon with local candidates Linda Lea and Joe Porter. Also met Chris Bates in his wonderful cafe http://t.co/Osd5Mazlw6 Wed Apr 15 15:55:14 BST 2015

Labour left a £38bn black hole in defence finances, now they won't match our plan to spend £163bn on new equipment #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 12:14:38 BST 2015
Suppose we know why that is though, Ed is preparing to get into bed with the SNP http://t.co/rjFWef0Esp Mon Apr 13 12:05:09 BST 2015
Keeping our country safe should be any gvnmnt's no.1 priority. Shame Labour don't agree, Trident isn't even mentioned in their manifesto Mon Apr 13 12:03:16 BST 2015
Labour have never understood that if you want strong public services, you need a strong private sector. Government doesn't create wealth. Mon Apr 13 11:56:21 BST 2015
But don't take my word for it, listen to Ed Balls. #SameOldLabour http://t.co/kfgrfjQ5AO Mon Apr 13 11:25:54 BST 2015
And every single Labour Government has left office with unemployment higher than when they came to office #SameOldLabour #VoteConservative Mon Apr 13 11:15:06 BST 2015
Labour promised 'strict rules for government borrowing' in 1997, then went on to rack up biggest deficit in peacetime history #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:14:05 BST 2015
This is Labour's legacy and they still haven't learnt their lesson. We can't let them wreck our recovering economy. http://t.co/jCzJY6Efhy Mon Apr 13 10:09:07 BST 2015
Ordinary Moorlanders shouldn't be taxed on homes you've worked hard to own. If you agree, #VoteConservative on 7 May. http://t.co/j2EAWBpr1y Sun Apr 12 13:12:04 BST 2015

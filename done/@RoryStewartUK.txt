@AlstonMoor - come along to the Alston surgery this Sat + we can discuss. There's a lot of support for Alston, r
@2ndJake - I think I was pretty consistent from the beginning - see my New York Times op-eds from 2005 or the footnotes to Places in 2003
@pjamesstuart fewer than i'd like
@eddie2ward - great to meet you too - and good luck with what you are doing, r
@pjamesstuart - I've written about it on http://t.co/VI3p7TCLRQ. Containment + protection of the non-Isil areas - the refugees there
Today we have published our recommendations on how to create a more independent ombudsman for the armed forces http://t.co/YkIk9si5nh
@carneross @nybooks - thank you Carne, rory
@charlesjkenny - thank you, Charles, rory
@__arshan - I'd focus your undergrad time on a genuinely academic course + leave the diplomatic angle till grad school
@IronicRobin - no - need to work on it
@IronicRobin touche!
A great chance to support the local Pride in Penrith lottery which provides funding to local community groups. http://t.co/TxnGXHOmjQ
@__arshan  very few - they were graduate classes

@IanCharmi - No - Scottish devolution must + will be delivered as promised, no ifs, no buts, no conditions attached
@ianrmillard thank you and no worries - Jefferson and Madison not Franklin are the key

Some thoughts on Britain's strategic gap in Defence policy http://t.co/3uVTvMcgjh
@ianrmillard - it was Paul Tyler who made the comparison with US - we are v much lacking Founding Fathers for any solution: let alone 4 mths
@DpSRNh also means acknowledging that constitutional law shd be separate from normal law + immune from temporary parliamentary majorities
@JustinGriggs @BrianBartonMK @NALC @SLCC - your work on local democracy has never been more relevant - let's not lose this opportunity
@andymacmichael - we must deliver to Scotland immediately - but that is only the beginning
@DpSRNh - the challenge is to keep the momentum up before the issue dissolves in more immediate politics and elections.
@ParitasBiz - the British constitution has always been the core of British identity - its values/principles should define the country
@DpSRNh - it is critical - in the end Britishness/UK identity rests on the constitution. Without it separation will become inevitable
@andymacmichael all parties have shied away from the constitution. Keeping focus + energy on this will be v tough
#Today. We need a constitution to engage citizens, strengthen local democracy + regain British identity. Let's not squander this opportunity
We're at the cairn throughout the day - come + join us + bring a stone of celebration http://t.co/j79Al60b4R http://t.co/IQImbCuxf2
Please RT our thanks to all.  Let's now be worthy of the decision + build ever stronger links between our 4 nations. http://t.co/abbublbjca

Incredible too that in a 2hr debate in parliament no one raised Libya where Misrata militia, linked to Islamists, now control Tripoli.
Front page of @thetimes this morning shows Iraq, Ukraine + Scottish independence are the core issues of UK debate today
A month ago "policy-experts" were confident Putin had decided to back away from Ukraine and argued Crimea was the limit of his ambitions
The critical priority is to rebuild our Russian analysis sections, which have been crippled over the last 20 years - http://t.co/B4ornGDlSE

@Bethinthegarden :)
@qed_lsc - wall st journal did a good piece a month or so ago. But you're right not as much as you'd think out there
@thomasforth - why did he only talk about 30,000 students then, if Scotland needs many times that amount to balance demography?
@nuttyxander -  all immigration anxieties will surely vanish soon as you reveal your new immigration policies + targets. Lk frward to them
@emilbordon - thank you - come back + you'll see a lot of changes...rory
@MissCEJames - can't believe it wasn't shown. 6 weeks to go + the biggest political issue in the UK since WW2 + not shown across UK?
@f_roddy - if Scotland is genuinely going to have a different immigration policy to r UK as AS said - yes there wd need to be #ScotDecides
@stridingedge  - that's right - apologies - flourishing reiving opportunities...
@indiaknight - my sense is that not many minds changed on either side
love the STV spin "trending worldwide on TWITTER and this meant a few problems on broadcast...'
AS argues for "indefinite right to stay" for all foreign students in Scotland? Implications for rest of UK? For the border constituencies?
Will AS follow up on more immigration as an answer to demography and pensions? #ScotDecides
Interested to see response to Gaelic Language v pensions... #ScotDecides
@Zinaad :)
@DpSRNh you must be right - yes
@DpSRNh I guess so...
AD shd make more of the "you can't save the oil money in a fund and spend the oil money at the same time" argument #ScotDecides
Pleased that arguments are at last made for solidarity across the UK rather than splitting to keep resources #ScotDecides
Sudden eruption of political theory on sovereignty and mandates (the qn wd have made more sense if the whole of the UK were voting)
AS must be pleased with the focus on currency now
@DpSRNh which is why this has to touch on history + identity. Debate on national independence - without discussion of nationhood is bizarre
Not sure the interrupting, accusations + tempers work - assume they're going to come back calmer + focused on using their time
@NATOpress @AndersFoghR @ftcomment  - thank you Oana
@nuttyxander I'd be honoured Alexander - tweet it in to AS + come + join #handsacrosstheborder
I think AD cd say 'Yes I agree with DC" the qn is not can Scotland flourish alone? The qn is "can it do better in the union?" #indyref
This is bizarre - AS' time is very limited - it doesn't seem as though he's yet asking the qns, his supporters wd want him to ask #indyref
@iainmartin1 - it's bizarre use of limited time - can't understand what he is thinking
AS deciding to attack the #bettertogether campaign rather than challenging the Union or making arguments for independence. Good use of time?
AS is deciding not to ask questions about policy but about 2013 newspaper reports on the campaign - project fear etc - why no qns?
Not a currency union but a "currency agreement"?
Could AS not find a way of answering the plan B question? Why does he have to avoid it?Surely there's an answer he can provide? #scotdecides
"I agree with Jim Sillars" AD
the Drambuie add seemed a strangely moving image of our referendum predicament #ScotDecides
do you feel the audience is equally balanced? #ScotDecides
@mikearcher87 - v frustrating - the high usage/crash seems to suggest that it would have been popular and relevant for people across the UK
@MirrorJames says STV website has collapsed - glad I'm watching in Scotland not relying on web
Thanks all on the STV question - on now
looking forward to Salmond-Darling debate tonight but have had to drive North to Scotland to watch it. Why is it not shown in rest of UK?

Some thoughts on why parliament + the Defence Committee needs to keep asking uncomfortable questions about UK Defence http://t.co/4TzG6v4xx4
@itzzMeRich - Tolkien fascinated by this period - 'the men of the north", lost kingdoms, norse mythology, dispossessed kings
@ruairidunne - + the prejudices of occupying armies - who do take that attitude
@ruairidunne - where? certainly not sthing I feel. Afghanistan is a modern country - point is decentralisation, isolation + cultural differ
@MikeHannity @CyberBrat1320 - the original language of what is now England, Wales, and most of Scotland
@MikeHannity @davidroachcouk @CyberBrat1320 - NO - both modern welsh and Cumbric share a common Brythonic ancestor...
@CyberBrat1320 @klockedthis - I meant that the Kingdom of Strathclyde and Cumbria was a British Brythonic speaking Kingdom not Gaelic
@Joshpaulevans @Ed_Miliband - will look - I suspect there cd be real cross-party support for more local democracy
@jonc2012 @jm0ses - Cumbric was a brythonic language - see the Gododdin - different from Scottish gaelic
@klockedthis @jonc2012 - you're right it was a history of the Middleland from the Iron Age to 1603. It's not an analysis of today..
@CyberBrat1320 @klockedthis - you're right that Galloway had Gaelic while Dumfries, Borders, Lothian, Cumbria, Strathclyde Brythonic
@CyberBrat1320 @klockedthis - I didn't mention that he spoke fluent English either.
@CyberBrat1320 @klockedthis - that for sure. I tried to emphasise the influence of Irish Christianity on Lindisfarne + Northumbrian art
@jonc2012 - I guess I find it difficult to believe the line wd have run from Carlisle if it wasn't for the Romans. Firth of Forth or Humber
@CyberBrat1320 @klockedthis - most of the celtic influence in the Middleland is Brythonic/Cumbric not Gaelic
@george_shepherd - thanks - no to question - the world's moved on..

@northumbriana where is that quote from?
@amymvickers - sorry about no Dolfin. But why the Dolfin enthusiasm?
@cabocampbell - for the same reason I don't mention Mercia or Wessex - it's focused on the land between what's now england +scotland
@Highlander1809 - trying! But short of time...
@davidroachcouk - "bairn" for example is a Northumbrian word, still found both sides of the border
@TimProbert - thank you - that's what I was hoping might happen. Results of debate please :)

@tigerglass 2/2 so ecclesiastical landholdings play into the border politics
@tigerglass - yes - I think Lindisfarne's position then becomes the key in moving the English-Scottish border North of the wall 1/2
@NEIL_OLIVER_ @countrywalking - Neil, I'm very flattered...looking forward to your Australia programs...rory
@tigerglass  - what did you want included on the Athelings?
@tigerglass - 2000 years in 2000 hours makes Oswy tricky to fit in - but yes - if I had more time I could have developed beyond the monks
@ettrick49 @BBCScotland - watch it + see what you think - my guess is neither side of the referendum will like it - it's pro-Middleland

@gothicheart81 @perlineamvalli @TheJournalNews - textoverdii, votadini, and carvetii were divided :)

@PeterActual and then rejoin the rest of the UK????
@ndls61 @bmc875 @RuralLeader @PeterActual @GHmltn (cont) the modern border was only finalised by a French ambassador in 1552 on Scots dyke
@PeterActual @pmidgley @ndls61 @NiclasReddish - that is an argument for stronger leftwing politics in UK, not an argument for separation.
@PeterActual @ndls61 - borders are artificial + often destructive but Yes they matter + that is why we should resist making more
@ndls61 @bmc875 @RuralLeader @PeterActual @GHmltn - the original Northumbrian border was the Firth of Forth. But all grew from the wall
@ndls61 @bmc875 @RuralLeader @PeterActual @GHmltn - no. Cumberland was taken by Rufus and settled by Meschines, and then retaken by David
@ndls61 @bmc875 @RuralLeader @PeterActual @GHmltn - wrong Andy - William Rufus built Carlisle + Newcastle exactly to make the border there
@PeterActual @pmidgley - again your anger about party political positions - which is shared across Britain - and is not about nationhood
@PeterActual @pmidgley - and I'd expect you to know that we have Sellafield in Cumbria - Scotland's challenges are Britain's challenges
@ndls61 @RuralLeader @bmc875 @PeterActual @GHmltn - we actually have five borders in Cumbria :) - hence Penrith and the Border
@northumbriana - Dan - I'll give you the extension challenge - Pse get some more friends to register http://t.co/yKDmxY3441
@RuralLeader @PeterActual -If you do fight for it in the UK + show solidarity - rather than retreat from the debate in the rest of the UK
@RuralLeader @PeterActual - social democracy is a specific political ideology that has no inherent connection to Nationalism or independenc
@RuralLeader @PeterActual @GHmltnI I agree. But the arguments being made are all about the merits of social democracy not nationhood.
@PeterActual @GHmltn @RuralLeader Scottish nationalism has far more to say about tax + welfare than it does about national identity
@PeterActual @GHmltn @RuralLeader - strength + weakness of Scottish natlism is that it is more a political than a national movement
@LoveBattersea1 - be great to have you along on 19 July - pse register at http://t.co/j79Al60b4R - if you haven't already
@chrisbrooke - ah yes - hope you'll join us on 19 July http://t.co/j79Al60b4R - it must be non-party political - so we need you!
@Rosahnia thank you - pse write to contact@turquoisemountain.org

@dagwells @GeorgeFoulkes - we'll run from Gretna to Newscastle but you're right, not through the Kielder forest!!!!

@AlecShelbrooke
@ripaljeet @BBCLeeds @RichardStead Thanks, it's paramount that all agencies - medical and pastoral - work together to deliver better care.
I'm looking forward to taking questions in the @BBCLeeds hotseat at 11am today. Tune to @RichardStead this morning...
Shadow Housing Minister @EmmaReynoldsMP is in #Elmet&Rothwell Friday. Will she explain why LabourCouncil voted to build over our greenfields
Utter hypocrisy from @Ed_Miliband today - #Labour use zero-hour contracts and Labour MPs voted down my bill to ban unpaid internships. #fail
@SandgateRAG In the last budget the Chancellor announced £500m for SME developers to use brownfield sites.
@SandgateRAG I stood up and called for this in the @HouseofCommons Chamber. I continue to lobby for that and a revised housing target.
@SandgateRAG Plenty of families seeking affordable homes and cheaper brownfield land should be the answer. Not sites like #Sandgate.
Leeds families need affordable homes on brownfield land with new schools. #Labour just gave ok for developers to cherry pick sites they want
With #EdMiliband pledging 200k new homes a year, no wonder #Labour in Leeds just gave go ahead for demolition of greenfield land in #Leeds.
Angered that #Labour council has given go ahead for 70k homes. These'll be large homes on green land, not the affordable homes families need
Incredibly moving at the Tower of London this evening. A stunningly British mark of remembrance. #LestWeForget http://t.co/06zZ0IzkFO
#EdBalls completely out of his depth in the Chamber on EU finance statement. #LabourFail
There are days for political campaigning and there are days for remembrance. Disappointed #Labour chose to campaign in #Elmet&Rothwell today
At 3pm I'll be laying a wreath of remembrance at St. Mary's in #Garforth. http://t.co/8d8kS9Ve5i
Great community spirit in #Kippax as we came together to remember those who have fallen in conflicts passed and present. #WeWillRememberThem

At 11am I'll be laying a wreath of remembrance in #Wetherby. My wife, Susan, will be laying a wreath in #Rothwell. http://t.co/MJkhmDGP8R
Today we remember those brave servicemen and women from #ElmetandRothwell who gave their lives for our freedom. #WeWillRememberThem

My latest @DailyMirror article on why sentencing for drink drivers should be stricter, and apply across Europe.  http://t.co/kpWt94n78I
Productive morning in #Carlton today, discussing key local issues with residents.
@beztweets Hi, if you read my speech you'll see I did. But called for deportation and EU-wide bans on EEA foreign national offenders.
At request of my constituents, I'm visiting St. Leonard's Hospice @SLHYork this morning to see what great work they carry out in #yorkshire
Last set if appointments in #woodlesford today to discuss #HS2 compensation scheme.

Today's @LeedsNews reports my call for strict sentencing on drink drivers who kill. More here http://t.co/NpGqVIRRL3 http://t.co/wtKypbF3sj
Welcome to #Leeds @RichardStead and good luck on your first @BBCLeeds show. I'll look forward to my first an on-air grilling by you soon!
Disgraceful discrimination by #Labour in #Rothwell. Well done to my constituent Mr Brewster for speaking out: http://t.co/i9W4s9gQaV
Today I gave the toughest speech I've had to deliver @HouseofCommons. In some small way I hope I did Callum justice. http://t.co/NpGqVIRRL3

@Woojwh @AB_Residents Please could you email me the details and I'll seek to raise this with @KeepmoatHomes on your behalf.
@ChurchFentonHS2 Understand your frustrations but I'm afraid I won't apologise for putting my constituents first. I answer to them first.
@frankmurphyhorn No problem. Any Qs just let me know.
@WoodyGull No problem. I'm encouraged by comments of LCC leaders today - and that FT article was proved a nonsense. Any Qs just let me know.
@richahack It's a review but it recognises the initial proposals aren't perfect. If the station location is moved, then so must the route.
Encouraged by today's review of HS2. A small victory for my constituents and our call for relocation of the station, and re-route the line.
Chancellor says initial plans drawn up for HS2 over 5years ago - under Labour - are not perfect. Pleased they're being reviewed.
PM says HS2 remains cross-party vision, mentions how Labour Leader of Leeds Council and others have been at No10 lobbying for it in Leeds.
Sir David Higgins says he hopes discussions with Leeds City Council "continue at pace" to find a better solution to the HS2 station in Leeds
Site of HS2 station will dictate route taken into city. Relocation could mean re-route along transport corridors, not through #Woodlesford
Labour Leader of Leeds Council welcomes PM, Chancellor and Sec of State to Leeds. Says his Council will play an integral role delivering HS2
HS2 Ltd: "The simple fact is that the existing station needs to be remodelled, and over a similar timescale to the completion of Phase Two"
HS2 Ltd: "There is a direct relationship between the choices that need to be made about the station [location] and the approach to the city"
I'm at #LeedsCivicHall this morning to represent constituents in #Woodlesford #Garforth #Swillington in our campaign to re-route HS2 line
Conservatives have offered more to workers than Labour's minimum wage pledge. Read more in The Shelbrooke Post: https://t.co/3wL2HETxPR

@will_sparling That's not what PM said. We want British Bill of Rights reflecting British values & doesn't prevent us deporting terrorists
@TigerTaggart I do and it's well used by my constituents #outoftouch (I've also used less of their taxes on it than my predecessor)
For #ElmetandRothwell a #Conservative Government will raise the personal allowance to £12,500. Cutting taxes for over 40,000 workers
For #ElmetandRothwell a #Conservative Government will cut taxes for those trapped in the middle. We will raise the 40p rate of tax to £50k
For #ElmetandRothwell a #Conservative Government will increase the state pension, let you decide how to spend it and cut pension taxes
For #ElmetandRothwell a #Conservative Government will take those working full time on the minimum wage out of tax altogether
The choice in #ElmetandRothwell is clear: it's me or #EdMiliband's candidate. Tax cuts or tax rises. Growth or debt. More jobs or job losses
Today @David_Cameron set a vision for hardworking people in #ElmetandRothwell - a secure future for all or back to square one with #Labour
Pleased to see @DWPgovuk taking up concept of my #WelfareCashCard. State should prevent, not assist, further poverty: http://t.co/Zag0j3sCmL

@saheaton My pleasure, I'm always out and about in the area if she has any other issues she'd like to raise with me.
@lizzielh Yes indeed, black holes in #Labour's health plans and no plan for #education either
Today #EdMiliband and his candidates showed no plan for the issues #ElmetandRothwell voters are bothered about #economy #immigration #crime
Presume #Miliband's mansion tax idea has a threshold of £2m because his own mansion is worth over £1m. #wouldntmindbeingapoundbehindhim

@Hodgys78 @Bhikkubodhi But you can't stop that. You can have a land supply though so apps can be chucked out. Think proactive, not defeatist
@Bhikkubodhi Yep Cllrs and I meet regularly to discuss local plans. I'm still of the view that Headley could solve all our problems.
@Bhikkubodhi Oh - hi Peter! Yes I have hard copy in the office, just emailed Julian for it electronically. Always appreciate your tweets:)
@Bhikkubodhi Ill pass your comments on to your local Cllrs. Your identity is, however, hidden...could you DM me your details please.
@Bhikkubodhi The SHLAA is a LCC decision, SoS is in quasi-judicial position but visit did help us highlight inappropriateness of A58 sites
@Bhikkubodhi Julian handed a specific brief to him but you raise a good point, I'll ask for the doc to be sent to me and see SoS receives it
@Bhikkubodhi It was organised by local Cllrs but Julian Holmes was present to represent the PC. Julian did the talking, and did a fine job.
@Bhikkubodhi Cllrs asked members of the planning grp to be present and Julian handed him a brief re Collingham. We put msg across strongly.
@LeedsCityRegion I'd be delighted to. Please email me further details.

@Bhikkubodhi You're welcome. Have a good bank holiday weekend.
@Bhikkubodhi Because it's PR, big parties not likely to return more than two MEPs. Those higher up wouldn't therefore stand for council too.
@Bhikkubodhi List of candidates ranked in preference order by party, so lower down the list is like standing in non-target Westminster seat
@Bhikkubodh List of candidates ranked in preference order by party, so lower down the list is like standing in non-target Westminster seat

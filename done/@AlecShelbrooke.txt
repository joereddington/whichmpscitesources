@PescisPen The NHS MUST always remain free at the point of need and at entry. And it remains so today despite Labour scaremongering Sat Mar 28 16:08:37 GMT 2015
@PescisPen Meanwhile budgets have been cut in Labour-run NHS Wales. We've got 7000 more doctors, 2000 more midwives, but there's more to do Sat Mar 28 16:07:51 GMT 2015
@PescisPen We can't get away from the fact we need a strong economy to pay for the NHS. That's why we've increased budgets year on year Sat Mar 28 16:06:39 GMT 2015
@PescisPen My sister is a orthopaedic surgeon so I know the pressures and admire anyone who works selflessly in that environment. Sat Mar 28 16:05:22 GMT 2015
@PescisPen In short, as far as the state is concerned (rights/tax/law) I agree in equality regardless of sexuality. Sat Mar 28 16:04:07 GMT 2015
@PescisPen A bit like France, so you're 'union' is by the state and then it's up to each religion to deliver the 'blessing' as they see fit. Sat Mar 28 16:01:36 GMT 2015
@PescisPen I think equality would be best achieved with equal civil partnerships, recognised by the state in law regardless of sexuality. Sat Mar 28 16:00:33 GMT 2015
@PescisPen If you email me I'll expand my thoughts but my objection was to the state's role in religious freedom 1/2 Sat Mar 28 15:59:33 GMT 2015
@PescisPen Ultimately I believe in backing aspiration and opportunity for all. This is what I've campaigned on in Parliament. Sat Mar 28 15:50:54 GMT 2015
@PescisPen I think it's important to be a real 'local' MP, caring about the area you live and work and not just plonked in by your party. Sat Mar 28 15:49:59 GMT 2015
@PescisPen Perhaps you could email me your main concerns and I'll happily respond with my actions/thoughts. campaign@alecshelbrooke.co.uk Sat Mar 28 15:48:50 GMT 2015
@PescisPen Nationally I'd ask if we could afford to go back to economic chaos under Labour. Locally, I'd highlight my local record of action Sat Mar 28 15:47:55 GMT 2015
@JannineScattert Thank you! Very much appreciated. Sat Mar 28 15:38:39 GMT 2015

@realtoadee I argued against Labour-run Council's plans. They're forcing 12,500 homes on my constituency yet not enough brownfield for it Wed Mar 25 21:49:02 GMT 2015
@Victoria_VEP Hope that's helpful Mon Mar 23 17:50:41 GMT 2015
@Victoria_VEP I don't think they send a confirmation, but you can phone Leeds Electoral Services to check it's received 0113 395 2858. Mon Mar 23 17:50:27 GMT 2015
For updates on #BostonSpa armed robbery follow @Wetherby_News but please stay clear of crime scene whilst emergency services do their work. Mon Mar 23 11:44:43 GMT 2015
Shocking report of armed robbery and gunfire in #BostonSpa. I'll be speaking with police but urge residents to keep clear from crime scene. Mon Mar 23 11:21:57 GMT 2015
@realtoadee To summarise, if we choose to manage budgets sensibly we can invest in key services like libraries and not make political cuts. Sat Mar 21 08:28:27 GMT 2015
@realtoadee Lab Cllrs spent £500,000 off our money refurbishing their offices at Civic Hall/£140,000 on private taxis/£1m on new furniture Sat Mar 21 08:26:10 GMT 2015
@realtoadee Locally they're a hub, why I objected to Labour Councillors closing them whilst wasting £millions on a new website 1/2 Sat Mar 21 08:23:34 GMT 2015
@realtoadee Libraries are records of our past for the future, that's why I'm proud I secured funds for expansion of Brit Library #BostonSpa Sat Mar 21 08:21:02 GMT 2015

Packed #MPAdviceSurgeries in #Garforth this morning. On the whole residents very happy with #Budget2015 Fri Mar 20 12:39:07 GMT 2015
@djspares No trouble. If there's anything you'd like me to feed into the Treasury on your behalf, drop me an email. Thanks. Fri Mar 20 11:33:39 GMT 2015
@djspares To be competitive: i.e we've already reduced it from 28% to 21% and it's set to decrease to 20% as was in Gov budgets. Fri Mar 20 11:06:33 GMT 2015
@djspares Equally, it's right we then say to firms: tax is competitive so we expect you to pay it. If you don't we'll impose fines. Fri Mar 20 10:50:44 GMT 2015
@djspares The key is that tax is competitive so global firms invest and create jobs here in the UK, eg #hitachi #siemens Fri Mar 20 10:48:52 GMT 2015
@HelPip83 Hi, it's just how the electoral roll is formatted and mail-merged for our literature. Any issues please let me know. Thanks, Alec. Fri Mar 20 10:02:51 GMT 2015
@djspares Sorry, I get hundreds of mentions each day, please can you resend an i'll answer Fri Mar 20 09:59:11 GMT 2015

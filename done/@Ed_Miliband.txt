.@David_Cameron is taking our NHS backwards and @Nigel_Farage wants to privatise the NHS completely. Let's stop them. #6monthstowin
I am fighting to win the next election to save our NHS from @David_Cameron and @Nigel_Farage. #6monthstowin
Farage can twist and turn but he cannot deny it: he wants to privatise the NHS.

If you missed my speech earlier today, here’s a bite-sized version of what I said: https://t.co/0llNf6XMNb #6monthstowin
.@Nigel_Farage Bring it on. I look forward to a debate with you, @David_Cameron and @Nick_Clegg in the election campaign.

 #6monthstowin
My values are British values: work must be rewarded, public services need protecting, and vested interests must never hold our country back.
People on zero hours contracts while some of the richest pay zero tax is a zero-zero economy we have to change. #6monthstowin
Britain only works for a privileged few at the top. I am determined to win next year so Labour can change that. #6monthstowin
My speech today will tell you what I think the election is all about - follow @UKLabour and I’ll be back on Twitter later with more.
@UtopianFireman It's been shambolic. Firefighters risk their lives to save ours & deserve better. That's why I've signed the Commons motion.
@getthewashingin @DJFlo70 The bedroom tax & Health & Social Care Act will go. We won't just undo Tory damage: we'll improve Britain for all.
@horatioharry @CharlieWoof81 @itsourian  I won’t! I’ll change the law so 16 and 17-year-olds can vote.
@featuresuk To show people that we don’t have to have a country that only works for a few powerful people. Britain can work for everyone.
@JadeFrancesAzim … tackling rip-off fees that make renting so expensive, high quality vocational training, and votes at 16.
@JadeFrancesAzim We’ve got lots to help young people out: a jobs guarantee, better apprenticeships and more of them, building more homes…
@JadeFrancesAzim We need to show young people that voting can achieve change - & if they vote Labour we *will* change Britain for the better
In six months a Labour government can begin the business of changing our country for the better. Help us get there: http://t.co/j2sPSrnD30
A Labour govt will:
Raise the min. wage
Ban exploitative zero hours contracts
Guarantee jobs for young people
Build more homes
Save the NHS
We need big change. We need to be a country that works for everyone again. Labour will deliver that change. #6monthstowin
Questions @HarlowCollege Q&A earlier reflect an unhappiness with David Cameron's status quo. On living standards, housing, the NHS & more.
I've been at @HarlowCollege talking to students and local people about what a Labour government will do for Britain http://t.co/keas3G2bNQ
@itsourian Labour is the party of work, of the NHS, of fighting for fairness, equality and progress.
@itsourian I don't have a daughter but I'd tell my sons that Labour is a party for everyone, not just a powerful few.
@DJFlo70 I won’t let you down. As I said yesterday, it’s time we changed Britain so it works for everyone, not just a powerful few.
@yorksfella59 @CharlieWoof81 Together we can save it, and we will. But we have to fight hard to make sure we win in May. #6monthstowin
@Makrina91 He doesn't understand that his recovery is working only for a few. We have to change the country so it works for everyone.
@sweetersong Sorry to hear you can’t make it, there will be more events coming up soon though.
At 11am we remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our country #WeWillRememberThem #TwoMinuteSilence
@Harryslaststand I'm humbled by your support, Harry, thank you. You have my word, we won't let people down.
@huxley06 Thanks, although even I would concede that photo-wise it doesn't work out every time...
@Sharonavraham Another example of the shambolic Tory leadership saying one thing and doing another. They take the British people for fools.
@Harryslaststand You’re an inspiration. I will keep working to build on the great country you & your generation of Labour supporters gave us
@LabourEoin @David_Cameron is strong on the weak, but weak on the strong. I promise I will always stand up for those who need me.
@LabInSpiRed @jon_swindon  I promise never to lose sight of the fact that @UKLabour is a party #forthemany
@CharlieWoof81 I don’t need to tell you that Labour built the NHS & saved it before from Tory hands. Together we will do it again.
Leaving the European Union would be a huge mistake for Britain. It would risk millions of jobs & make Britain weaker, not stronger. #CBI2014

That’s why on Europe, he daren’t say yes and he daren’t say no. He’s the don’t know Prime Minister.
He’s caught between his backbenchers who want to leave and our national interest that demands we stay.
The Prime Minister used to say he would never be for leaving the EU. Today every business in the country heard him refuse to say that now.

Alistair Darling is a man of values, decency and kindness. He will be much missed from the House of Commons.
Congratulations to Labour’s @AlanBillingsPCC – he will bring experience, independence and a fresh start to South Yorkshire police.
We won't let them get in the way of a recovery that reaches every street.
No surprise that some bus companies don't like Labour's plans to put passengers first.
Pleased to support @AlanBillingsPCC today. He's experienced, independent-minded & thoroughly decent. A fresh start for South Yorks police.

The 453 British service men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice and the thousands wounded must never be forgotten.
The handover of Camp Bastion is a time to remember those who have served Britain so courageously in Afghanistan over the last decade.
3 million British jobs and thousands of British businesses rely on the EU. I won't be the Prime Minister that puts that at risk.
I'll reform our immigration system. With Labour you'll get clear, credible, concrete change, not false promises or a risk to jobs & business
I’ve been in Rochester & Strood outlining the clear, credible & concrete steps Labour would take on immigration: https://t.co/C77YRJvDxO

The NHS is already at breaking point after one term of this Prime Minister and all he offers is five more years of crisis. #PMQs
Lovely evening celebrating Diwali with Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists from around London this evening at the @UKLabour Diwali reception.
Very sad to hear that Lynda Bellingham has passed away. She was far too young. My thoughts are with her family today.
It is critical that we improve early diagnosis of cancer so we can match the best countries in the world for surviving it.

I'm heading back to London from Heywood & Middleton. I went to congratulate @LMcInnes_Labour & thank Labour supporters who worked so hard.
Huge thanks to all the amazing volunteers out campaigning for @LMcInnes_Labour & @Tim4Clacton today.

I'd like to wish the British Black community a happy & successful #BlackHistoryMonth. Here’s why I'm supporting it: http://t.co/3rPzhO4lgo
We want an NHS with the time to care. We'll invest £2.5 billion in the NHS for 20,000 nurses, 8,000 GPs, 5,000 care workers, 3,000 midwives.
I'll repeal David Cameron's Health and Social Care Act which puts privatisation and competition at the heart of the health service.
A Labour government would guarantee a GP appointment within 48 hours & a same-day consultation with a doctor or nurse for those who need it.
Under David Cameron, it has got harder and harder to get a GP appointment. One-in-four patients wait a week or more to see their GP.
In case you missed it - here's what Labour supporters are out campaigning on today: our NHS pledge: http://t.co/85PyQt3v5K

We cannot turn away from the threat of ISIL in Iraq. That is why we will be supporting the Government's proposal for UK military action.

It's great young members have a chance to be at Labour conference. Read what some of them had to say about their week http://t.co/GtwUrnSCYb
Our proposal will mean a pay cut of £7,125 for the PM. As we make tough decisions to balance the books all ministers must take the lead.
A Labour government I lead will cut government ministers' pay by 5% - and block any pay rises until the books are balanced.
A Labour government will have to take tough decisions. That will include capping child benefit. We’ll also cut and cap minister's pay.
As Prime Minister, I'd raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2020: http://t.co/iCGedL8zES http://t.co/ldVNvD2x8v
People are treading water, working harder just to stay afloat. That's why we have a plan to raise the minimum wage to £8 an hour. #lab14
I’ll be on the @MarrShow shortly. We want to raise the minimum wage to £8p/h. Here’s what I told the Observer: http://t.co/17mqcu61LC

Our focus now must be to listen to the victims and learn from the past to ensure this can never happen again.
It is right Shaun Wright has resigned. He was in a position of responsibility when the abuse scandal happened.
David Haines was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.
I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.
5 days left until the #indyref. A no vote means better, faster, safer change for Scotland. Here’s how you can help: http://t.co/M32n8R8KTD

Fantastic to hear that Prince George will soon be a big brother! Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their happy news.
I will miss Jim’s friendship and decency. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife and children.
Jim Dobbin's death is a sad day for Parliament. He was a dedicated public servant, representing the people of Rochdale for three decades.

In just 8 months a Labour govt will abolish the #bedroomtax, freeze energy prices, raise the min wage & get young people back to work.
In contrast to no-show SNP MPs, every Scottish Labour MP was in the House of Commons voting to get rid of the #bedroomtax
Alex Salmond is conning people. He doesn't stand up for social justice. Today the majority of his MPs didn't turn up to the #bedroomtax vote
David Cameron’s defeat on the bedroom tax shows two things: the Tories are on the way out & we can build social justice across the UK.
Incredible news. We've defeated the government on the cruel bedroom tax. This is a huge blow to David Cameron.
Voting now to reduce the number of people who pay the bedroom tax. Huge turnout from fellow Labour MPs who want to see it scrapped.
Today Labour MPs vote to reduce the number of people who pay the bedroom tax. And next May I'll scrap it altogether: http://t.co/yeOx04NXaF
The SNP are offering Tory policies - cutting taxes for corporations, cutting spending on schools & hospitals.
SNP has a funny idea of social justice: 3p tax cut for corporations, keep the tax cut for millionaires, no energy price freeze.
A Labour govt in 8 months will: 
freeze energy bills
raise the min. wage
introduce fairer taxes 
tax bankers’ bonuses 
scrap the bedroom tax
My message on #gms: vote No on the 18th, and vote for a Labour govt in May to bring social justice and change to the whole of Britain.
What we have seen must strengthen not weaken our resolve to defeat ISIL. #PMQs
We've all been disgusted by the murder of Steven Sotloff. Our thoughts are with his family and those of the British hostage being held #PMQs
ISIL's cold-blooded brutality against the innocent offends the values of people throughout the world, wherever they live.
The killing by ISIL of another hostage and the threat of more violence demonstrates again their murderous barbarism.
Ashya King needs the love of his family and the best medical care. Hopefully latest developments mean he can be reunited with his parents.

ISIL is a deep threat and source of instability to our world. We can’t shrug our shoulders and hope it goes away: http://t.co/5ttNsG3L7M
Douglas Carswell’s defection is not just a blow to David Cameron. It shows the Tory Party too divided to stand up for hard-working families
The ceasefire in Gaza - agreed by both sides to end the bloodshed - and the commitment to further talks is a very welcome development.
Alistair Darling showed once again tonight that Alex Salmond has absolutely no answers on key questions around independence. #BetterTogether
The death of Richard Attenborough is a sad day for the film world and the Labour movement. He and his work will be remembered.
The killing of James Foley is an appalling act. We will support government both to find the perpetrators and combat the threat of ISIL
Scots have always been part of leading the UK. In one month they vote on whether to leave. I hope they say No and stay in the UK #LabourNo

I’m proud of Labour’s record on devolution. That’s why I support more powers, guaranteed, for the Scottish Parliament.
David Cameron is right to condemn Hamas as a terrorist organisation but he needs to break his silence on Israel's indefensible actions.
I think Baroness Warsi has acted with principle & integrity. People around Britain have been shocked by the suffering we have seen in Gaza.

If you use trains regularly you should read this: http://t.co/wn5rPdCLBt
Rail fares have gone up by 20% since 2010 - & could go up by 5.6% next year. Labour would cap fare rises to take the pressure off commuters
I'm heading to Hastings for a Q&A. On the Charing Cross train. Do you commute on this line? Fares could go up by up to £260 next year.

By this time next year the election will have been fought and we’ll have a new government. Make sure it’s Labour: http://t.co/7iihCFWfDg
We each face a choice next year. A country that works for a few, or a country - with Labour - that works for everyone http://t.co/hxHj0HeiHq
This is the choice on the NHS. A public, integrated NHS under Labour or a fragmented service under David Cameron: http://t.co/h8SRapelSE
My thoughts today are also with Muslims across the world who will be unable to celebrate Eid-Ul-Fitr this year.
I wish Muslims in Britain and around the world a happy Eid-Ul-Fitr #EidMubarak
We need a public question time, where the Prime Minister regularly submits himself or herself to questioning from the public.
I want more people to be more involved in politics.
Yes, David Cameron takes a good photo (and I don’t), but he can’t build a country that works for you: https://t.co/GMunIHo8lf
I’m not going to win on photo-ops. But I'll be a PM with big ideas who'll stick to my beliefs. I won’t abandon decency at the door to No10.

I've just had warm and friendly talks with President Obama discussing Ukraine, Gaza, Europe and the economy.
As soon as the investigation into the MH17 crash is completed we need an emergency meeting of European leaders to consider next steps.
European unity must not be an excuse for European inaction: we must tighten & extend sanctions against Russia after the MH17 catastrophe.
I’ve just spoken to the Center for American Progress in Washington DC. My opening remarks on the MH17 crash are here: http://t.co/1ZbhjF8GX0
Here’s my speech: http://t.co/QpkuQiIQel. Now we need to take this message out into the country & win the election so we can change Britain.
I’m speaking to Labour’s National Policy Forum later. Britain faces big challenges – I'm proud that we're making the policies to meet them.
It's vital that a full investigation is conducted into what caused the tragedy in Ukraine.
My deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the nine Britons who were travelling on MH17.
Truly awful news about the Malaysian Airlines flight. My thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends.
The facts on the #bedroomtax are clear. The only government that will scrap it is a Labour government: http://t.co/Aer4imZl6a
The Lib Dems have repeatedly voted to keep the #bedroomtax. As Prime Minister I’d scrap it: http://t.co/9dx073sLDn
Are you struggling with the cost of childcare? Take this one-minute survey and let me know: http://t.co/Nyv3Q00OBw
Wonderful news from York where the Church of England has just voted to allow women bishops for the first time.
The Tories’ fire sale of Royal Mail has short changed us all to the tune of £1 billion. Enough money to employ 23,981 nurses for a year.
9,675,400 men & women in Britain today were born before the NHS was founded. Here are some of their stories: http://t.co/kR5YyLecrk
We must protect civil liberties as well as security. It's right we'll also have an independent review of these laws and their impact. ​
Labour will support emergency anti-terror legislation next week. My first duty is to keep citizens safe – I believe these laws are necessary
Last week the PM said A&E waiting times had gone down. Within 24 hours it was shown that average waiting times have gone up #PMQs
This morning I talked about how Labour would create new Technical Degrees. Here are the five things you need to know: http://t.co/Wrq3NhWeNN
Labour's vision is of a high skill, high wage economy where everyone plays their part. We can’t leave 50% behind: http://t.co/Wrq3NhWeNN
The forgotten 50% of young people that don’t currently go to university are being let down. We'll change that: http://t.co/Wrq3NhWeNN

Labour will end a century of centralisation and hand power back to local people: http://t.co/901EmbaSVq
This morning I launched a new plan for how Labour will hand powers back to local people. Find out why & how: http://t.co/901EmbaSVq
The 7/7 attacks could not destroy London’s incredible spirit. We welcomed the world in 2012 & continue to be a wonderful, global city.
Today we remember the 52 people whose lives were cruelly taken nine years ago & those who risked their lives to save the hundreds injured.
Labour will offer England a new deal: the end of old top-down politics & an era of people-powered public services http://t.co/wUVlVUwBGm
This is a very nice reminder of how special the NHS is, and why we need to defend it: http://t.co/TUaLvWBUb1
Great atmosphere in Leeds before the start of @letouryorkshire http://t.co/fGNgabvH9l

Great to be out speaking to people about #indyref at the Gyle in Edinburgh. http://t.co/zyezVRrnqD
I couldn’t be more proud to lead the party that founded the NHS. Here’s some of what it has achieved since 1948: http://t.co/te8HVXdvFe
From Glasgow to Birkenhead, Fife to Portsmouth - HMS Queen Elizabeth is a visible reminder of what we can achieve when we work together.
Britain's new aircraft carrier - HMS Queen Elizabeth. Assembled in Scotland - built in six shipyards around the UK. http://t.co/dHa9Xn2WiR
I'm on my way to the naming ceremony of the HMS Queen Elizabeth in Rosyth. It's a great example of co-operation across the United Kingdom.
Earlier I spoke @policynetwork about the changes we need in our economy. Here's what I said: http://t.co/LZplbxivBm
Labour will build prosperity for all of Britain by enabling our great businesses to build wealth, create jobs and make profits.
The murder of Mohammed Abu Khdair in Jerusalem was an appalling act. This is a time for restraint on all sides.
If you want a government that will put the right principles back at the heart of the NHS, say you're with Labour: http://t.co/MpIyf5z3Dy
The NHS is going backwards under David Cameron. Retweet this: http://t.co/XscPsmaIvc
Think people should know the Tories' real record on the NHS? Retweet this. http://t.co/hvigUgg4oG
David Cameron promised that his £3 billion NHS reorganisation would make the NHS better. But on count after count, things are getting worse.
Earlier I met @CR_UK ambassadors Jean, Christopher & Laura to talk about cancer survival. This is why they're here: http://t.co/bBfpIJeTss
The Cameron effect: The NHS is worse on cancer treatment, A&E waits, social care and GP access. #PMQs
Britain needs local people and local businesses making local decisions about how they can succeed for the future.
At Airedale International in Leeds to launch Adonis Report - a plan which will help great innovative businesses like this become even better
I'm on my way to Leeds to launch the Adonis Review which sets out our plans to create strong city and county regions.
The murder of Naftali Frenkel, Gilad Shaar and Eyal Yifrach is awful news. This was an utterly reprehensible act of terrorism.

Labour would build alliances for reform in the EU but David Cameron is taking the country towards the exit door, threatening 3m jobs.
David Cameron and the Conservative Party now pose a clear and present danger to our economy.
Here are some of my thoughts on Armed Forces Day and Labour’s duty to serve those who serve their country: http://t.co/XC4smMeDFA
Today we recognise the huge contribution the men & women of our Armed Forces have made to Britain. Thank you.  #ArmedForcesDay

Mental health is the biggest unaddressed health problem of our age - Labour would make it a priority: http://t.co/bUuL1nqe8d

David has been an amazing asset to the Labour Party and to Britain. His work has improved the lives of countless people across the country.
David Blunkett's commitment and determination have carried him to the highest positions in politics.
Earlier @AMCarwyn & I did a Q&A with members of staff at GE. Really interesting discussion. http://t.co/R2VZBwyL66
Great to bring the Shadow Cabinet to GE in South Wales - a world leading manufacturer supported by the Welsh Labour Government.
The Labour government I lead will not make do and mend. Britain needs far reaching reform - big reform, not big spending.
We will switch spending from benefits to bricks by giving councils more power to save money and invest in new homes.
A @UKLabour government will ensure hard work is rewarded by restoring the principle of contribution to the heart of social security system.
A Labour government will get young people to sign up for training not sign on for benefits.
Parents fear their children will do worse than them. That is not good enough for me and it is not good enough for Britain.

Those who work hard to create our nation’s wealth should share in it.  If you agree, add your name here: http://t.co/xcWM2aXcrs
Hard work should always pay a decent wage. So the Labour government I lead will strengthen the minimum wage to tackle low pay.
The National Minimum Wage is one of Labour's proudest achievements. It saved millions from poverty pay that shamed our country.
The scourge of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict is something we can and must tackle #timetoact
Today over 100 countries are gathering for the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in conflict in London #timetoact
Tragic news that Rik Mayall has passed away. He was a brilliant comic talent, writer and actor.
My #100DayPledge to Scots is that Labour will continue to improve devolution with Scotland as part of the United Kingdom.
In 100 Days, Scotland has an historic choice. Together we created the NHS & the minimum wage. Together we can keep achieving social justice.
If the allegations against Qatar are verified, there will be an overwhelming case for re-opening the bidding process

Bernard Jordan's incredible story shows the spirit of D-Day veterans is alive and well: http://t.co/Nh2yCkVYIh
Whether on the backbenches, the front bench or in the Cabinet, Peter has served the Labour Party and the country tirelessly.

Have just represented the Labour Party at the incredibly poignant UK-French Service of Remembrance at Bayeux Cathedral.
Yesterday I was privileged to meet Mark Radley who served with my Dad on HMS Hilary during D-Day. http://t.co/EgAgPOaqUF
I will be remembering the tens of thousands of servicemen and women who left our shores knowing mortal danger lay ahead.
Incredibly proud to be travelling to Normandy this morning to commemorate those who died and risked their lives during D-Day.
We're living in freedom because of people like Mark Radley​: http://t.co/H7sXV8sp5x http://t.co/GnwwBdB2Lt
We must never forget the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought fascism for democracy during World War Two: http://t.co/H7sXV8sp5x
It was great to hear Mark’s stories from the Normandy landings. He and my dad were only 19 and 20 years old when they set sail for France
70 years ago, Mark and 150,000 Allied troops set sail for France. 11 months later the Allies defeated Nazi Germany.
Today I met Mark Radley who served on the same ship as my dad during the D-Day landings. http://t.co/pa91n3l01M
They were part of that great generation who risked their lives on D-Day to fight for the freedom we enjoy today. http://t.co/EgAgPOaqUF
Today I met a remarkable man. Mark Radley was just 19 when he served with my Dad on HMS Hilary during D-Day. http://t.co/EgAgPOaqUF
Very proud that @MichaelPayneUK is the @UKLabour candidate. He cares about his community and will work hard to protect local NHS services.

Tonight, I have the privilege of honouring some of our local communities’ unsung heroes from headteachers to healthcare workers.
A Labour Queen’s Speech would introduce a Bill to stop NHS privatisation and make it easier for patients to see their GPs
A Labour Queen’s Speech would stand up for renters and be tough with developers with a Housing Bill to build 200k houses a year by 2020
Labour would freeze energy bills & reform the energy market with a Consumers’ Bill. The companies can afford it & the British people need it
Labour would stop workers being undercut with an Immigration Bill that slows the pace of change but does not cut us off from the world
A Labour Queen’s Speech would create a Community Bill to take power from Whitehall and put it back in our great towns and cities
A Labour Queen’s Speech would have a Banking Bill to support small business, because the banks still need to change to serve our economy
For the first time, most of the people in poverty in Britain are people in work - we need to deal with that
A Labour Queen’s Speech would have a Make Work Pay Bill – you should be able to make ends meet if you work all the hours God sends
We need a new direction for Britain to make this country work for all, and not just a few at the top. Today's speech did not give us that.
Disenchantment with politics goes beyond one party and one government. We cannot afford to ignore it.
More than at any time for generations, Parliament faces a battle for relevance and legitimacy in the eyes of the British people.
I'm in Parliament to hear the Queen's speech. It is David Cameron's last chance to tackle the challenges our country faces.
A Labour Queen’s Speech would include legislation to make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes again in Britain.
Today’s Queen’s Speech should include a programme for government equal to the scale of the challenge our country faces.
David Cameron doesn't have a plan for families struggling with childcare. We do. RT if you're with us #forthemany http://t.co/UHxIkezuPL
If you’re a parent and you can spare 3 minutes to share your thoughts on childcare, I would love to hear from you: http://t.co/PED3Vkd5Ji
Childcare costs have risen five times faster than wages since 2010. Labour has a plan to help families struggling. http://t.co/2iy5x3xbTh

.@MichaelPayneUK has put Newark Hospital's future at the heart of his campaign - people here want a good local hospital they can rely on.
I've been meeting patients & staff at Newark Hospital with Labour's by-election candidate @MichaelPayneUK http://t.co/Mk1kYVQI5E
We have work to do to reach out to millions. But that’s what I am determined to do. Will you join me? http://t.co/OCuTiC2AvR
I want to lead a party that brings people together, from all walks of life, all backgrounds & all classes. That’s what I mean by One Nation.
To meet the challenges we face we need more change, not less, to create the wealth of the future with decent jobs and wages.
I have changed Labour’s position on immigration. But I won’t make false promises, or cut ourselves off from the rest of the world.
If you work hard to support your family and build a better future, you shouldn’t be left behind. You certainly shouldn’t be ignored.
Millions feel our country doesn’t work for them, that politics isn’t listening and cannot answer them. It doesn’t have to be this way.
The last Labour government was right to be open to the world but there is no future in saying we can pick up from where we left off in 2010
To understand these elections we can’t just look at the last few weeks or the last three years but much further back: the last three decades
I'm in Thurrock - right next to the Dartford crossing - talking about Britain's future & the lessons we need to take from these elections
If you share my values of hard work, fairness and opportunity then help show that we can make Britain work again: http://t.co/EKthMQuN8o
Over the next year, I'm determined to show that @UKLabour can bring the change this country desperately needs.
There is a deep sense of discontent with the way this country is run and the way our economy works.
But last night’s results also reflect a desire for Europe to work better for Britain and deep discontent within our country.
We made real progress in the Euro elections. We’ve elected 20 @UKLabour MEPs and beat the Tories.
Where we now have majorities, Labour-run councils will make a real difference to the lives of the people they serve #forthemany​
Thank you to everyone who has campaigned to elect hundreds of Labour councillors today.
I am determined that Labour shows you over the next 12 months how we can change your lives for the better http://t.co/yaQkErgef2
Congratulations to Labour in Crawley - another #labourgain today. Over the next year they’ll show that we can deliver the change people want
Great news from Amber Valley. Now Labour-run after for the first time in 14 years. Congratulations to the whole team there
Also congratulations to the @UKLabour teams in Redbridge and Cambridge. We’re showing we can win in key battleground seats for 2015.​
Congratulations (& early #ff) to @StephenCowan, the new Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council
There is a deep discontent with the way the country is run and a deep desire to change.
Across the country people have voted Labour to make change happen. I'm determined we persuade people we can improve their lives.
Today, we campaigned for a Britain where hardworking people are better  off. Tomorrow the campaign begins to win that same fight in May 2015
Thank you to every Labour supporter out campaigning today (especially those who got soaked!)
Labour will make the long-term changes we need to tackle youth unemployment & give young people the chance to get on http://t.co/VRAI21ZM88
Business rates are costing small firms £1700 more. Labour will cut & freeze rates and help 80,000 businesses http://t.co/MAiHojo7sW
We believe that people who work hard should get decent pay. Vote Labour today because we'll fight for a living wage. http://t.co/pfcGuN3Oam
Too many people are left stressed and out-of-pocket because of zero-hours contracts. Labour will fix that: http://t.co/rgVmRLj6Q4
The Tories have given millionaires a tax cut. Labour would give millions of people a tax cut with a 10p starting rate http://t.co/bdqLe8Jh6m
Labour will stand up for renters by banning rip-off letting agents' fees and making longer term tenancies the norm http://t.co/4buPE3S2Ka
Thank you to all the supporters campaigning for a Labour win today. Your work means so much to me, but means even more to a better Britain.
I've just voted in Doncaster. Make sure you get out to vote & have your voice heard. Polls are open until 10pm. http://t.co/Yj73bbU0Oc
Polls are now open. There are loads of reasons to vote Labour today, ten are here - http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl. Have a look before you vote.
It’s been a busy day on the road today. Here’s a look back on everyone I met and the conversations I’ve had: https://t.co/9sqySCyiXn
Today I met Louise & Chris, a really loving, happy couple. Their story was disheartening but we can do something: http://t.co/3jCa53D4Kb

I'm finishing the day door knocking in my constituency in Doncaster. Before you vote tomorrow, read this: http://t.co/vrnAp3NOzV
Rent is just one of the many cost of living issues I've been talking about with people around the country today: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
“I have 2 jobs & a good salary but because so much of my income is eaten by rent & deposits are so high, I’ll never own a home” - Stephanie
9th visit of the day done: talking to workers at Tesco in Hucknall about Labour's plan to cut income tax for 24 million people.
“We worry about every July because of the inevitable rent increase. It's a constant feeling of insecurity & stress for our family” - Kathryn
“We fear reporting issues in case the landlord evicts us, but feel trapped as deposits/fees make it so expensive to move again” - Amina
“As a working single mother, finding a flat I could afford was very difficult. I have no extra income at the end of the month” - Cat
I'm spending my journey to Doncaster reading your renting stories. They are so powerful that I wanted to share a few.
Today I’ve been talking to people who rent their homes. I asked for your experiences of renting too, and hundreds of you responded.
Labour will get 200,000 houses a year built by 2020. Labour-run Lincoln City Council is shows us how it can be done: http://t.co/R0vqyPmTn9
We are suffering the biggest housing crisis in a generation with house building at the lowest level since the 1920s
The difference a Labour council makes: I just visited Lincoln's first council-built social housing in 20 years.
Want to follow what I’m up to on the final day of the campaign? Take a look at this: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
"Energy bills keep changing and going up" - Maryam, Bedford. Labour will freeze gas & electricity bills to 2017: http://t.co/00QYUzM6Ju
If you can spare a minute, I’d be really interested to know about your experiences of renting a home: http://t.co/aEhOhUNhTg
Labour will expand free childcare to 25 hours a week for three- and four-year-olds to help parents balance working & being with the family.
Childcare costs have risen by 30 percent since 2010 - five times faster than wages - but the government doesn't have a plan to help.
I just left a children's centre where I talked to Charlotte about Labour's plans on childcare. Here's what she said: http://t.co/vtJqmnMYKy
My day on the campaign trail: ten stops, ten pledges. Here’s a map to help you follow along: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
I just spoke to Laura about her apprenticeship with @CharlesWellsLtd. Here's what she told me: http://t.co/jSQiYE0h2F
Labour will create more high quality apprenticeships focused on young people entering the jobs market.
Labour will guarantee every young person out of work for more than 12 months a paid starter job.
We need to make big long term changes to training and education so that young people have the chance to get on.
Under David Cameron hundreds of thousands of young people are unemployed - the Tories are failing a generation.
I met the @openuniversity's Vice-Chancellor Martin Bean earlier. He told me why they decided to pay the living wage: http://t.co/JHruqsXPWN
Now I'm heading to Wells and Young Brewery to talk to some young apprentices about the training they're getting.
Labour will make big changes to the minimum wage - making sure that all workers get decent pay for a hard day's work.
We'll introduce 'Make Work Pay' contracts to encourage more employers to pay the living wage - companies that sign up will get a tax rebate
Low pay is a huge problem for millions. David Cameron is doing nothing to tackle it. Over five million people earn less than the living wage
It's been really good to be here at the @openuniversity campus in Milton Keynes to hear about their commitment to the living wage.
@piratetreasures I'm sorry to hear your daughter is affected. We need to get building houses again in this country. Please pass on my best.
@alyinwonderland We want to give people certainty about rent so longer-term contracts will be the norm. We're looking at buy-to-leave too.
Labour will stand up for renters - we'll ban rip-off letting agents' fees and make longer term tenancies with predictable rents the norm.
Since 2010 rents have increased more than twice as fast as wages, and people who rent face upfront fees of up to £500.
I'm on my way to Milton Keynes to talk to people about the cost of renting going through the roof. Is the cost of renting affecting you?
My second visit of the day - and my third cup of tea. I'm here to talk with people on zero-hours contracts. http://t.co/jN1prIFNxP
Business owners like Savas and Irem are struggling - our business rate cut will help them: http://t.co/30rHcyGjJM

To every fantastic @UKLabour volunteer - here are ten pledges you can take out on the doorstep in the next two days: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
Tomorrow I'll be travelling around the country for the final day of the election. Ten visits, ten reasons to vote Labour on Thursday.
Over the last few weeks we have shown the difference Labour can make where it matters: on housing, on the NHS, on wages, on immigration.
Rachael works hard but she's struggling to make ends meet. Labour will make sure people like Rachael get decent pay: http://t.co/Jscac0IWsU
Under David Cameron:
13,000 millionaires got a tax cut
60,000 carers are hit by the bedroom tax
Help me change that: http://t.co/uSQ5e8ALrQ 
I'm on @GMB at 7:20am talking about some of the ways Labour will help families with the cost-of-living crisis. http://t.co/Sf1cLatPfL
I think a hard day's work should mean a decent day's pay. If you agree sign this: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
Labour will make biggest change to the National Minimum Wage since we introduced it. But we need your help to do it: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
If you do a hard day’s work you shouldn’t find yourself in poverty. Sign this if you agree: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
Thank you to every @UKLabour supporter who was out campaigning this weekend. We knocked on 157,000 doors on Saturday alone. Amazing work.
Talk to friends and people at work about what Labour will do: give every hardworking family a share in the wealth they help to create.
This week we can begin to bring change by electing Labour MEPs to fight in Europe for working people and electing Labour councils. -Ed
There is no future for Britain competing on the basis of low pay with the sweat-shops of the world. -Ed
We will set a target for the next Parliament designed to move the National Minimum Wage closer to average earnings by 2020. -Ed
Today, I am proud to announce that the next Labour government will take new radical action against low pay. -Ed
As a basic principle we should aspire to a situation where if you do a hard day’s work you shouldn’t find yourself in poverty. - Ed
Over five million people are low paid in Britain today. 1 in 3 women in work, 40% of young people. It doesn’t have to be this way. – Ed
The Tories said the minimum wage would destroy millions of jobs. It didn’t. - Ed
There is a low pay epidemic in this country. The Tories don’t get it, but we do. -Ed
Today, we’re setting out more answers: the biggest change to the National Minimum Wage since it was introduced 15 years ago. -Ed
Labour has been setting out the answers, on zero hours contracts, rip off letting agent fees, a right to see a GP within 48 hours. -Ed
UKIP don’t have the answers. Keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive is not going to make our country work for working people. -Ed
The Tories don’t get it, they really believe everything is fixed. They just don’t get the problem. - Ed
Big question in this election is whether we can get our country to work again for most hardworking people & not just a few at the top. - Ed
I’m in Walsall to talk about what Labour will do to give everyone a decent day's pay. A member of my team will tweet while I speak...
Under Labour workers on the minimum wage will not be left behind - hard work should mean decent pay.
Britain is one of the lowest paid advanced economies. Labour will restore the link between hard work & decent pay for working people.
Thousands are out campaigning for Labour candidates & Labour values to win on Thursday - will you join our team? http://t.co/hqTfMmJxOu
We're knocking on 100,000 doors this weekend to tell people that a vote on Thursday for @UKLabour is a vote #forthemany
Have written to Narendra Modi to congratulate him on his victory and pledge Labour's commitment to strengthening our relationship with India
I'm on with @MurnaghanSky at 11am on @SkyNews . If you're still unsure how to vote on Thursday, watch it.
Really wonderful looking at all the #LabourDoorstep photos on Twitter today. We have a great and vibrant movement.  #forthemany​
Crawley's youngest campaigner stealing the limelight from me, @AnnelieseDodds & @chrisoxlade http://t.co/tIg0TRf3Ae http://t.co/htAGVSQR8U
I'm really proud to be campaigning alongside @UKLabour members and supporters across the country today #LabourDoorstep #forthemany
Labour will build a better Britain for you and your family. This is how we'll start: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl #forthemany
These elections are about the millions of people across our country whose voices the Tories will never hear - Ed
Labour will scrap the Tories' terrible Health and Social Care Act - Ed
Labour will put the right principles back at the heart of our public services. An NHS based on co-operation, care & compassion - Ed
Labour will restore the promise that the next generation can do better than the last - Ed
Labour will build a country that works for all and not just a few at the top - Ed
This is what UKIP really offer: "Keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive”. Bigger cuts than the Tories. Charges to see your GP - Ed
The Tories say Britain can’t do better than this, that this is as good as it gets. They're wrong - Ed
If you worry about the cost of living, the life you can build for your kids, about the NHS: Labour is on your side - Ed
I'm in Crawley to kick off the last five days of our local & European election campaign. A member of my team will tweet while I speak...
We need to do more to champion high-wage, high-skill jobs - like at Airbus. That's how we build a better future for working people.
I want an economy that works for working people - we've become too dependent on low-skill, low-wage migrant labour.
I gave a speech today at Airbus on how Labour's changed on immigration. http://t.co/s3epPuHncW
Until then: Here are ten ways Labour is going to help you and your family: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
Later I'm meeting Airbus workers in North Wales to talk about jobs, Britain's role in Europe and how Labour has changed on immigration.
The biggest issue facing our country is how we restore the link between work & the chance of building a decent life for you & your family
We can't get the right solutions to the problems in our NHS without going to see what's really going on. So I did: https://t.co/gIlFDsq4Tg
If you missed my interview with @theJeremyVine on how Labour will improve social care you can listen here: http://t.co/hIGkpXbyXD
If you missed our new NHS film on tv last night here's the 15 second version: http://t.co/sCvJtid2QY
Labour councils are already finding ways to improve social care - the next Labour government would make it a national priority.
Carers do incredibly important work- yet they aren't given the time they need to do their job and hundreds of thousands are on low wages.
I was just on @BBCRadio2 with @thejeremyvine - talking about how we can improve the quality of social care. http://t.co/VrGatZDNZh
At my NHS speech on Monday I was asked what Labour would do to improve the quality of care. This is the first step: http://t.co/PnSclrfQvt
David Axelrod has joined me at Shadow Cabinet to discuss how we win and change Britain. http://t.co/GvrYIPZ46Y
At #PMQs David Cameron was unable to answer any questions on the future of research and jobs from the Pfizer deal.
David Cameron is cheerleading for Pfizer’s bid rather than championing British science and industry. #PMQs
Tragic news that Stephen Sutton has passed away. His bravery & determination to live life to the full was an inspiration to us all.
Last night Tories & Lib Dems voted against banning rip off letting agents' fees. A govt I led would stand up for renters & ban rip-off fees.
My vision for our NHS: Care, co-operation & compassion. Not privatisation & competition. Watch: http://t.co/AP3pjBGjtl
I dread to think what five more years of the Tories would mean for the NHS. I promise to lead it to a better future http://t.co/6hjjMNC6JT
I want to get on and improve the NHS and make sure it’s still there when our kids need it: http://t.co/wks7ytEBHR
Tories & Lib Dems combined to stop our ban on rip-off letting fees for tenants. A Labour government will scrap them: http://t.co/NkhELSRxLn
I just voted to help nine million renters with the cost of living by banning rip-off letting fees.
Generation rent needs proper protection against being ripped off. Today Labour MPs will vote to give them a hand and ban letting agent fees.
Last month, I spent two days in a hospital seeing the amazing work done by our NHS. Watch my film: https://t.co/R7q9NzK99V
If you missed it yesterday: Here's a look back at my NHS speech and our GP guarantee: http://t.co/e9TEY10QPT
Stories like this make me even more determined to bring in a GP guarantee if Labour wins the election next year. We've got to fix this.
"I couldn't get an appointment at my GP last year & was told to wait until the following day. I ended up needing emergency surgery."
"It's impossible to get (GP) appointments to fit in with work responsibilities."
"We have to wait 8 days to get an appointment now compared to pre-2010 when we got a same day appointment. It's not right."
"I waited so long for a GP appointment that my mental health issues got worse. Now, I need more treatment than I would have needed.”
I'm on the train back to London. I've been reading some of the responses to our GP waiting times poll (take it here: http://t.co/6m26VvhE6k)
If you have a second, let me know if you'd had a tough time getting a GP appointment: http://t.co/C1G2TZBnae
Told @BBCBreakfast & @BBC5Live that Labour will guarantee everyone can see a GP in 48 hours. The Tories don't trust doctors to deliver this.
Speech done, one more thought before the end of the day: The NHS is one of the greatest things our country has ever done. We must protect it
Ed: Britain loves the NHS, Britain needs the NHS, and working together we can protect and improve the NHS for the future.
Ed: Labour will have the right priorities:
- Co-operation not privatisation
- Patients before profit
That’s what makes the NHS what it is.
Ed: The Tories say if it worked for the privatised utilities why shouldn’t it work for the NHS? That says it all. Not under my government.
Ed: We need to end David Cameron’s dogmatic obsession with bringing competition and privatisation into the heart of the NHS.
Ed: As well as same-day consultation, we'll guarantee a same-day GP appointment if you need it & that everyone can see a GP within 48 hours.
Ed: Today I can announce that the next Labour government will guarantee a same-day consultation with your GP surgery.
Ed: In 2010, the vast majority of patients could see their GP within 48 hours. Today only 40% of people get an appointment within 48 hours.
Ed: David Cameron has proved the oldest truth in British politics: you can’t trust the Tories with our NHS.
Ed: The NHS staff and patients I recently met in Watford had something in common. They all know these are hard times again for the NHS.
Ed: I recently spent two nights with staff & patients at Watford’s NHS hospital. Every patient I met had such belief & pride in our NHS.
I’m in Manchester to talk about our plans for a stronger, better NHS. A member of my team is going to tweet while I speak, stay tuned...
Aneira was the first baby born under the NHS. In her lifetime she's seen the Tories try to wreck it & Labour save it: http://t.co/lkqCZAJ9dt
In the last 12 months almost a million people waited more than four hours to be seen at Accident and Emergency.
On David Cameron's watch we've had a chaotic & expensive reorganisation of the NHS that no one wanted & which he promised wouldn't happen.
The nurses & physios I spoke to want to do their jobs & provide the best care for their patients, but that's getting harder under the Tories
I've spent the morning at Leighton Hospital in Crewe talking to staff & patients about our NHS http://t.co/0ZFt9konwf
Apart from banning exploitative zero-hour contracts, here are nine other things a Labour government will do: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
A passenger was walking through the train & stopped to ask me what we're going to do about exploitative zero-hour contracts: we'll ban them.
I'm heading to Crewe this morning for a hospital visit. But first, I want to recount a conversation I had on the train from Euston.
John's unshakable commitment to public service was rooted in his Labour values & deep desire to improve the lives of people across the UK.
Twenty years ago today, the Labour Leader John Smith - a man of great decency & deep integrity - sadly passed away. http://t.co/t0cJtH2EAa
We have a national crisis in primary school places and it's of the government's making: http://t.co/ySLO3XNRG5
29 years ago today, 56 people tragically died in the Bradford City Fire. My thoughts are with the family & friends of all the victims.
I'm campaigning in Leeds taking questions with @hilarybennmp http://t.co/16FsvIwYvP
Good to meet Mr & Mrs Meek campaigning in Askern with our excellent Labour councillor and candidate Iris Beech http://t.co/jApAEiZBqR
Labour would get 200,000 houses a year built and tackle low pay with make work pay contracts: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
There's been a 60% rise in working people claiming housing benefit since 2010. David Cameron is falling people on housing and decent pay.
If you're in Newcastle anytime soon go to Grainger Market, it's lovely here. Why did I get lunch on the train? http://t.co/aRa721rP8m
I'm on the beautiful train journey from Edinburgh to Newcastle. It's tough to beat this view. http://t.co/EyeAYDkblC
With Scotland in the UK and a Labour government next May we can deliver real change on jobs, housing, low pay and the cost-of-living.
Our new Scotland Act would mean more powers for the Scottish parliament over income tax, housing benefit and the work programme.
I'm in Dundee to launch Labour's contract with the people of Scotland - including a new Scotland Act in our first Queen's Speech.
I've just been to Michelin in Dundee. High-tech quality jobs & a great apprenticeship programme (so say Kris & Craig) http://t.co/X6OgP05Kdz
“We made the decision not to have a second child as a result of the cost of childcare.” -- Anne, Richmond
"I returned to work when my daughter was 7 months old. By Friday, I’m out of pocket by £30. It’s not worth me working” -- Louise, Liverpool
“I’m a nurse working permanent night duty so we can keep childcare costs down. Our family time is suffering.” -- Zoe, Manchester
"Both myself and my partner work part-time. We’re better off by working less just to keep childcare costs down.” -- Danny, Norfolk
Earlier I asked you to share your childcare stories with me - hundreds of you did. Here are a few I felt needed sharing...
When I was young I lived in Horsforth. It's good to be back here supporting Pudsey candidate @jamiehanley http://t.co/FgPmRjeykm
Childcare costs have risen 5 times faster than wages here in Dewsbury. Here's what Labour will do to help with that: http://t.co/PQjn26auFp
I've just been talking with parents of these lovely kids at a children's centre in Dewsbury. http://t.co/QA9FCjU4fc
Are you struggling with the cost of childcare? Take this one minute survey and let me know: http://t.co/Lz0qBXHA8m
I was in Salford Quays to do a few TV interviews & talk about how the cost-of-living crisis is hurting families - especially childcare costs
I just bumped into Sue, Catherine, Lynda and Carole having lunch in Salford Quays. (Thanks for sharing your chips) http://t.co/NcJ8aBe0Sc
@MazHappy Hi Marion - we'd start by making sure 3&4 yr olds of working parents get 25 hours of free childcare a week
@Aubreii Sorry to hear that Shaun - I know it's tough to make ends meet. We'd extend free child care hours for 3&4yr olds.
The main issue raised at Burnage Children's Centre: mums and dads struggling to balance childcare costs and work. http://t.co/zeS7ep8xXO
Our cost-of-living contract shows the immediate steps we'd take to help families struggling to make ends meet: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
Working people have seen their wages fall by £1,600 since 2010.
Renting is getting more expensive, which hits 1.3 million families with children.
And childcare is in shorter supply: there are 578 fewer Sure Start centres & 35,000 fewer childcare places now than in 2010.
Childcare is getting more expensive: costs have risen by 30 per cent since 2010 - five times faster than wages.
Here's why we think families with children need more support:
I'm meeting parents today for a simple reason: families with children have been hit hardest of all by David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis
On the train to Stockport to visit a Sure Start centre. I'm going to talk to parents there about what Labour would do to make life easier.
9 million renters need a government that will stand up for them. With Labour, that’s exactly what they’ll get. http://t.co/UQYh3MEuEJ
If we win the election a year from today, we'll ban rip-off letting agent fees. To win, we need you: http://t.co/CnoOdmexSL
This week I met Mhairi. She wants stable rent so she can save up to buy a house. Instead the PM is abandoning generation rent.
At #PMQs David Cameron refused to act on rents. Tories have abandoned Generation Rent.
The Prime Minister is cheerleading for Pfizer’s bid for AstraZeneca rather than championing British science and industry. #PMQs
What we do in the next year will determine the future of Britain for generations. I want you on our campaign: http://t.co/CnoOdmexSL

London Labour councils are acting on the scandal of empty homes. Tory councils just shrug their shoulders. http://t.co/VIYazfyJSd 
Shortage of homes makes life tougher for millions of hardworking Londoners. Our plan to tackle the housing crisis: http://t.co/VIYazfyJSd
I'm really proud to launch London Labour’s campaign for local and European elections with a plan to help families get a home of their own.
Just launched London Labour's local and European election campaign with candidates and supporters in Croydon. http://t.co/c7V2sqkp1H
Mhairi: 'we want to buy, in fact we can afford a mortgage, but renting costs make it difficult to save. Longer tenancy would help us plan.'
Mhairi's story is familiar: can afford a mortgage, but high cost of renting makes buying impossible.
Heading to Croydon for London campaign launch. But first time for a cup of tea with Mhairi in Streatham. http://t.co/t4YBm3ggKR
Terribly sad news about Elena Baltacha. My thoughts are with her family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.
As Prime Minister I'd make sure takeovers like proposed AstraZeneca bid are in the national interest: http://t.co/8qPr6eZr0L
Our science/R&D base is key in winning a race to the top. The PM must publish a proper assessment of Pfizer bid http://t.co/3ybTUj046Y
Instead of cheerleading for Pfizer's takeover, David Cameron should be standing up for our national economic interest http://t.co/3ybTUj046Y
Appearing on the @MarrShow this morning to talk about local & European elections. Will also comment on AstraZeneca takeover.
Important read via @guardian this morning - Conservative authorities have the highest council tax rises: http://t.co/8xIpBmboDy

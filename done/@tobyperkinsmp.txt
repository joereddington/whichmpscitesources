Yes @joeyjonesashapps  'accidentally misrepresented the truth' in an interview why threaten legal action to defend the lie? Sat Apr 11 16:59:24 BST 2015
#madforit in Middlecroft. The @LabourChestrfld team are like a coiled spring ready to hit the #labourdoorstep http://t.co/VqqKYbwc4I Sat Apr 11 15:23:45 BST 2015
So in summary Tories say:'We've done our best on NHS,vote for us for further managed decline.' Britain can be better than this- #VoteLabour Sat Apr 11 13:09:02 BST 2015
it's almost as though you're suffering from the same lack of imagination as your Tory puppets @tnewtondunn -feeble stuff. Sat Apr 11 12:34:57 BST 2015
Another great @LabourChestrfld turnout on #labourdoorstep in Brimington. We've got #GE2015 to win. http://t.co/J1Ykb1eYTF Sat Apr 11 11:30:54 BST 2015
Not sure if anythings more invigorating than 8am leaflet round before 1st of 3 #labourdoorstep sessions, but if there is I've not tried it! Sat Apr 11 09:38:37 BST 2015
Not sure if I'm surprised only @LabourChestrfld will be fielding candidates right across Chesterfield & Staveley in Borough & Parish elexn. Fri Apr 10 22:17:41 BST 2015
@Andy_Spireite DM me your address Andy, and We'll get it round. Thanks for asking. Fri Apr 10 17:37:59 BST 2015
Back from massively positive #labourdoorstep session in St Helens. Really good vibe right now. #VoteLabour http://t.co/by7xRVacdh Fri Apr 10 17:02:09 BST 2015
@PaulGoodmanCH @wallaceme @ConHome Yes there is. Labour have more PEOPLE willing to speak to VOTERS. #virtualparty #labourdoorstep Fri Apr 10 07:33:07 BST 2015
As Pickles prickles his way thru #r4today it occurs to me that I can't recall an angrier GE campaign by a party of govt than this Tory one. Fri Apr 10 07:26:43 BST 2015
Wake up to sad news that Richie Benaud has died-his voice such a feature of growing up watching Cricket on @BBCSport #RIPRichie Fri Apr 10 07:05:35 BST 2015
@ham_wich This is a legitimate question, to which the answer is probably No. Soz. Thu Apr 09 21:06:00 BST 2015
Hey, awesome to be quoted by @JanAageFjortoft puts a spring in the step at the end of a long day. #utb #sufc Thu Apr 09 20:51:18 BST 2015
Don't often quote Thatcher, but as Tories sink to personal attacks maybe this is a prescient commentary on #GE2015 http://t.co/vhbXFHeGyB Thu Apr 09 20:44:18 BST 2015
Doesn't the entire difference in tone btwn Labour's campaign & Tory one not demonstrate that Britain would be a happier place under Labour? Thu Apr 09 20:39:56 BST 2015
Dark photo in bright sunlight and a warm reception on Brampton #labourdoorstep ,though Brittania looked appealing. http://t.co/tdznutRK8l Thu Apr 09 17:53:55 BST 2015
With month to go to #GE2015 & @ChesterfieldBC elexn, 3rd Lib Dem resignation brings team of 14 Cllrs down to 11. http://t.co/VfDYaLogV6 Thu Apr 09 16:51:46 BST 2015
So Tories have pushed #nondoms off the news agenda thru' vile personal attack on Ed Miliband masked as #Trident policy debate. Clever. Thu Apr 09 16:39:53 BST 2015
About to commence the Brimington #labourdoorstep Wish me luck! http://t.co/3zbWF1Xev0 Thu Apr 09 14:23:41 BST 2015
Think @campbellclaret could offer Lynton Crosby some advice. When the 'behind the scenes' guy is trending, he's doing his job wrong. Thu Apr 09 13:02:18 BST 2015
@jimmy1666 Just read thru my recent tweets to see what your referring to, but can't immediately work it out. Thu Apr 09 12:53:18 BST 2015

@NuffSaidThis Interesting question. Think majority that I meet are pleased that I've bothered to call. Wed Apr 08 22:59:49 BST 2015
Yes @montie your party is increasingly desperate as they confront their political mortality. Each new smear more desperate than 1 before. Wed Apr 08 22:41:45 BST 2015
Positive vibe around our #labourdoorstep campaign in Chesterfield.In Brockwell with @LabourJill @labour_steve &JD. http://t.co/ngsxo8PaS3 Wed Apr 08 17:47:57 BST 2015
@mark_a_ellison Read Ed Balls' full quote. This policy will address concerns he raised then.Tory claim has evaporated, they edited his quote Wed Apr 08 14:16:36 BST 2015
David Cameron: "No, really we must retain nonDom Status & keep the bedroom tax. Are you listening to me?"  https://t.co/i46ZKrl6WJ Wed Apr 08 14:14:33 BST 2015
George Osborne defending non-dom status is perfect illustration of how he will do anything he can to protect the strong (&punish the weak.) Wed Apr 08 14:08:10 BST 2015
Another glorious Chesterfield morning, and another happy team on the #Ashgate #labourdoorstep http://t.co/2yRzQrTIVL Wed Apr 08 10:49:03 BST 2015

A happy team out on Sheffield Road #labourdoorstep today . http://t.co/YJcYgv9lg3 Tue Apr 07 10:44:38 BST 2015
And slowly, so slowly, the LibDem penny drops! MT “@ssamani: @ScotTories. You're crowing we lost support for going in coalition with you!” Tue Apr 07 08:24:35 BST 2015
How can Tories, who raised VAT to 20%, costing families over £500 a year, complain that Labour will introduce a Mansion Tax! #r4today Tue Apr 07 07:42:22 BST 2015
Yes, Theresa May, the IFS have debunked feeble tax rise claim, that's why on #r4today you can't answer John Humphreys questions Tue Apr 07 07:39:40 BST 2015
Theresa May on #r4today forced to admit that tax policy under Labour was redistributive with more money for lowest paid workers. Tue Apr 07 07:38:01 BST 2015
Hoping for more of this today. Beautiful weather for #labourdoorstep Newbold 1030, Old Whit 2.00 & Inkersall 5.30 http://t.co/xINgF0J1oS Tue Apr 07 06:54:44 BST 2015

@AlanMaris Don't believe any of employment arrangements at CBC would be affected by Labour plans on ZHC. Sun Apr 05 10:12:28 BST 2015
@AlanMaris We're not banning ALL temporary work,we're banning long term fixed hours work on ZHC. Over 12 weeks on same hrs=fixed hr contract Sun Apr 05 10:11:16 BST 2015
@dylsharpe I think when your focus has been on trying to keep Britain together you can be forgiven for being a little undercooked. Sun Apr 05 09:18:32 BST 2015
Not just Manchester, lots of Chesterfield workers glad to see back of Zero Hours culture.

Good for you that you picked up Ed's notes, but ridiculous to pretend that they reveal anything other than proper preparation. @dylsharpe Sun Apr 05 08:08:58 BST 2015
Personally I'm glad to hear that Ed Miliband thinks a Nationwide TV debate is worth preparing for. Silly @MailOnline http://t.co/FqCQzdNMEI Sun Apr 05 08:06:08 BST 2015
2nd #labourdoorstep of the day with relentlessly cheerful @LabourChestrfld team in St Augustine's. #VoteLabour http://t.co/seujHbx5pD Sat Apr 04 14:21:30 BST 2015

I never get carried away by 1 poll but once again instant reaction to Ed Miliband media performance is uplift for him & @UKLabour @Survation Fri Apr 03 18:48:25 BST 2015
Survation poll (1st since debate)showing LAB lead of 2& Ed Miliband with +ve approval is key bcos it suggests people like the more they see. Fri Apr 03 18:46:23 BST 2015
Amazing win for @ChesterfieldFC at Yeovil- 2-0 down, 3-2 up. And defeats for #pufc & Rochdale too. Lets just hope Barnsley lose tomorrow ;) Fri Apr 03 17:46:11 BST 2015
So much energy for #labourdoorstep right now. Good team in Brimington this afternoon http://t.co/YVmNztw3Ue Fri Apr 03 14:29:59 BST 2015
The rain stopped but we didn't. Lots of people saying they'll #VoteLabour on Hasland #labourdoorstep #labourselfie http://t.co/y5xpD81J16 Fri Apr 03 12:51:32 BST 2015
The day after the #leadersdebate we're off on a slightly damp #labourdoorstep in Hasland. http://t.co/FhidifSP2L Fri Apr 03 10:58:35 BST 2015
.@georgeeaton I think the case for Miliband -Cameron head to head overwhelming now. No one can argue he was out of his depth #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 23:37:22 BST 2015
@hopisen Didn't Cameron quote it incorrectly anyway? can he not read, or did he not actually have it? Thu Apr 02 23:24:42 BST 2015
Don't listen to 'Sturgeon won' tripe ICM &Survation polls had EdM in front. #leadersdebate but Scots might wonder why Osborne talking her up Thu Apr 02 23:12:43 BST 2015
Who do you think won the Leaders' Debate? I voted Ed in the @DailyMirror poll! Have your say:  http://t.co/wCZPDIVNxH Thu Apr 02 23:10:06 BST 2015
Tories said this election abt leadership and they've just lost their trump card. EdM ahead or level on all #leadersbate polls Thu Apr 02 22:58:35 BST 2015
Telegraph and Sun obvs went too soon before they'd seen the polls. EM either beating or neck and neck in polls. Thu Apr 02 22:58:01 BST 2015
So Osborne on #newsnight makes it clear. A vote for UKIP IS a vote for a Tory-UKIP coalition. Thu Apr 02 22:55:44 BST 2015
For all talk about minor parties today Ed Miliband proved that he can take Cameron and beat him & DC showed why he won't debate head to head Thu Apr 02 22:28:31 BST 2015
Guardian/ ICM poll of all 7 leaders has Miliband as winner. Just as I thought. Thu Apr 02 22:15:21 BST 2015
Some good points from smaller parties but Ed Miliband way ahead of #invisibleman Thu Apr 02 21:58:47 BST 2015
MT “@VoteJulianSmith: Very strong stuff from Cameron - #leadersdebates” hilarious #invisibleman Thu Apr 02 21:55:25 BST 2015
Cameron lying about ZHC. Labour wouldn't ban temp work, no Lab MPs employ people on the kind of contracts we'd ban. Thu Apr 02 21:53:28 BST 2015
Ed again explains difference between him&Cameron'Neither of us could live on 0 hrs contracts. The difference is I'll do something about it.' Thu Apr 02 21:51:21 BST 2015
Does Cameron still want to be PM? he's got no fight left at all. #invisibleman #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:44:45 BST 2015
@KyleJamesB_ No, have to put disclaimer on bio which I've done. Thu Apr 02 21:42:02 BST 2015
Cameron says the spending plans he said he backed were 'uncontrolled' . He's getting worse and worse. Thu Apr 02 21:39:08 BST 2015
Ed Miliband: 'Clegg and Cameron are blaming each other- and they're both right' #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:38:09 BST 2015
Nick Clegg promised to abolish tuition fees, now says he 'did next best thing ' he's not even trying now!! #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:33:15 BST 2015
@MattHancock2015 Hilarious! #invisibleman Thu Apr 02 21:31:59 BST 2015
Is David Cameron just sulking now- utterly invisible #invisibleman Thu Apr 02 21:26:50 BST 2015
Think people in Chesterfield working on zero hours contracts will think Cameron's flippancy on it pretty mirthless. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:24:14 BST 2015
Cameron hardly featuring in this debate. Seen him described as #invisibleman He hasn't got his friends in press to protect him now. Thu Apr 02 21:20:44 BST 2015
Cameron utterly baffled now. He's talking about a 3 sided coin. #leaadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:14:20 BST 2015
Cameron foolishly asks us to look at his record on Europe. Ed Miliband takes him up on the offer&reminds him of his failures #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:13:39 BST 2015
You can tell why Cameron didn't want this debate. He can't defend his broken promises on immigration &he can't defend his record on NHS. Thu Apr 02 21:11:17 BST 2015
Cameron already broke his promise to cut net migration #leadersdebate we need fair rules not the politics of fear. Thu Apr 02 21:08:41 BST 2015
@CAN_Communicate You will. Thu Apr 02 21:00:38 BST 2015
No way David Cameron will go in the ring with Ed Miliband again- absolutely taken him apart on the NHS! #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:58:34 BST 2015
Clegg now just playing it for laughs I think. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:50:19 BST 2015
Ed Miliband destroying Cameron on NHS broken promises #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:48:46 BST 2015
Ed Miliband absolutely specific about where Labour's money for the NHS comes from. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:41:20 BST 2015
Clegg in danger of exploding with irony as he criticises 'warm words on NHS' almost as tho record of failure on NHS isn't his. Thu Apr 02 20:40:21 BST 2015
As Nigel Farage says he cares for the NHS:  believe him?- why not view this: http://t.co/3qUK4nXm7V Thu Apr 02 20:39:00 BST 2015
David Cameron talks about tax cuts. They put up VAT 
after the last election and they will do it again. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:32:57 BST 2015
So clear why Cameron wouldn't have a debate with Ed Miliband, he's getting mullered & hoping it gets lost in general hubbub. #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 20:28:49 BST 2015
Cameron looks sick as Ed absolutely skewers his fear mongering. "David Cameron wants to double the cuts next year &put NHS at risk." Thu Apr 02 20:26:16 BST 2015
Clegg believes Cameron wants to make 'ideological cuts'. Oh so NOW you've noticed- joker #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:19:06 BST 2015
Hope Farage doesn't melt. #leaderdebate Would make an awful mess. Thu Apr 02 20:14:32 BST 2015
Ed Miliband sums it up: "Here's what I believe: Britain 
succeeds when working people succeed." #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:10:38 BST 2015
Cameron so obsessed with Labour, he can't focus on own agenda at all. He's right on 1thing, Britain can be better than this. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:09:03 BST 2015
Yet more evidence of why Tories want to prevent @Ed_Miliband being heard. @Independent: http://t.co/s9qnJcyJjk http://t.co/DfucnTBLKQ Thu Apr 02 17:12:46 BST 2015

@dalekpete That possibility has not escaped my attention. Tue Mar 31 22:48:05 BST 2015
@MartinScanlon1 I'd suggest that if you think exclusivity is only problem then maybe you don't understand how they can be used. Tue Mar 31 22:21:38 BST 2015
@MartinScanlon1 bcos they offer no security for workers& allow employers to evade responsibility they have to their staff. Tue Mar 31 22:20:47 BST 2015
@MartinScanlon1 Patronise IYL I was in business my entire career,ran 3 firms, spent 8 yrs in Recruitment, yeah I think I know the subject. Tue Mar 31 22:10:43 BST 2015

@foresttel You are right is a real problem. Recent success on Legal Highs may start to make a difference but will speak to Police abt issue. Tue Mar 31 21:13:20 BST 2015
@MartinScanlon1 I have answered quite specifically. ZHC should revert to minimum hrs contracts after 12 months employment where requested. Tue Mar 31 21:12:10 BST 2015
@MartinScanlon1 exclusivity is one pernicious aspect but not only 1. Not appropriate for long term stable(ish) hours employment. Tue Mar 31 16:47:40 BST 2015

@IbizaGarden Don't know, but am attempting to speak to bosses to learn more. Wed Mar 25 11:13:16 GMT 2015
@Kropotkin_alias Yes. Labour will: axe the bedroom tax, save the NHS, cut energy bills, tuition fees & Business rates, freeze VAT.#Bigchoice Wed Mar 25 09:39:00 GMT 2015
So EdM roughed up by millionaire worried about tax on £11M property, Cameron by pensioners worried about end of NHS.♥ Britain! #saysitall Wed Mar 25 09:27:57 GMT 2015
My favourite Cameron heckle was :
Cameron :"If you don't like what my Govt is doing, don't blame a Minister, blame me.
Audience: 'We are." Wed Mar 25 08:08:46 GMT 2015
Here's transcript of great @leicesterliz speech to @ageuk . Care of elderly is key policy challenge of 21stCentury http://t.co/fmLcnmP4ej Wed Mar 25 08:05:39 GMT 2015

@RichdelaRiv Ahead with Populus, tho think that might have been yesterday actually. Sat Mar 21 22:35:29 GMT 2015
So three out of four polls tonight have @UKLabour ahead, what's the betting @BBCNews report the one in which we're behind? Sat Mar 21 22:29:17 GMT 2015
So does doing a deal with EDL to arrange& cancel a march & stir up racial hatred, count as being part of 'Nasty Party' Desperate&disgusting! Sat Mar 21 22:23:51 GMT 2015

@peterpopw Wrong. It is not compulsory nor is there any consistency of provision, it is often amateurish at best, very much required. Fri Mar 20 16:01:22 GMT 2015
Pleased but unsurprised that @ed_Miliband speech to the @fsb Conference has been so well-received. Full text here:   http://t.co/GoWnephF3t Fri Mar 20 15:09:11 GMT 2015
Glad to back Chesterfield's amazing offer in #EnglishTourismWeek at the newly expanded @ChesterfieldVIC http://t.co/t4ltqCjtQR Fri Mar 20 11:25:59 GMT 2015

@jaytay28 So I took up the 140 char challenge, but if u wanna chat about YOUR priorities&what we'll do on them, DM me your number& I'll call Thu Mar 19 22:39:26 GMT 2015
@jaytay28 A mansion tax, not a bedroom tax, 36k more NHS staff; increase Min Wage, reform not leave EU; cut Biz Rate; cut tax& tuition fees Thu Mar 19 22:36:50 GMT 2015
Oh dear, just when you thought LibDems couldn't look any more farcical.Abusing parliament for cheap gimmick backfires http://t.co/1U8gS7xgVg Thu Mar 19 19:07:07 GMT 2015
@UnbiasedF Osborne did precisely that for 2 years, and he was the Chancellor. My tweet simply reflects what my constituents say. Thu Mar 19 18:28:56 GMT 2015
Interesting meeting at Harley's, Staveley putting world to rights about needs of Small Biz owners, low wage economy & future for pubs. Thu Mar 19 14:04:57 GMT 2015
An interesting morning being put thru my paces by St Mary's Yr 12&13 GS class. Great Q&A- I stressed importance of young ppl voting. Thu Mar 19 11:52:40 GMT 2015

@GordonHerriot Glad you are working again. Obv, don't know what your industry was or why u blame Labour, but interested to know. Wed Mar 18 22:22:24 GMT 2015
No, @alexwinter24 Mansion tax to pay for growth in NHS spending. 8000 Doctors, 20000 Nurses, 5000 carers, 3000 Midwives; not whole budget Wed Mar 18 15:05:25 GMT 2015
Ed Balls made it clear that Tory pension grab affects small %age of fund to cut tuition fees & Labour fee cut plan still stands @BBCNormanS Wed Mar 18 15:01:56 GMT 2015
Arrogance & self-congratulatory tone of Osborne's #Budget2015 statement will jar with hard-pressed families as he misses def target by £92Bn Wed Mar 18 14:32:31 GMT 2015
Stirring end to @Ed_Miliband #Budget2015 response having highlighted Tory failures, finishes with analysis of Labour's #BetterPlan Wed Mar 18 13:56:36 GMT 2015
Anyone counting: How many times was Chancellor interrupted during hr long speech& how many for EdM during last 15 mins? #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:53:01 GMT 2015
Tory groans whenever @Ed_Miliband mentions the #NHS says it all #Budget2015 They just don't want to talk about it. Wed Mar 18 13:48:39 GMT 2015
Once again @Ed_Miliband hits the nail: "The only thing long term about his plan is that it will take twice as long to balance the books." Wed Mar 18 13:46:29 GMT 2015
Of course Tory yobs attempting to shout down @Ed_Miliband again. They feign confidence but are scared to let him be heard. #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 13:43:17 GMT 2015
@GilesSearby In 2008 it did. But by May 2010 growth had returned, Don't let him pretend that stagnation of 2011-12 was someone else's fault Wed Mar 18 13:20:34 GMT 2015
As Osborne talks of 'Northern Powerhouse' - leader of Manchester exposes reality of Govt betrayal of the North. http://t.co/Fiygw95dlY Wed Mar 18 13:16:07 GMT 2015
Deficit was falling and economy growing in 2010. We promised to halve deficit, he's failed to do that. @pabforester Wed Mar 18 13:09:30 GMT 2015
Don't believe his stats, lots of smoke and mirros. @nony911 but if you dont believe me, read this: http://t.co/By68H48Uu8 Wed Mar 18 13:08:45 GMT 2015
FACTCHECK : @nony911 No, Osborne has borrowed more in 5 years than Labour borrowed in 13. #Budget2015 Wed Mar 18 12:56:35 GMT 2015
Anyone still viewing #Budget2015 might like to remember that the man triumphantly saluting himself has borrowed £219Bn more than planned Wed Mar 18 12:51:10 GMT 2015
Might have misheard but believe Osborne just claimed that recovery was delivering for poorest most!! Show him this: http://t.co/w6dksE9oVZ Wed Mar 18 12:48:13 GMT 2015
Does Osborne have any awareness of the gap between his view on how our economy is performing & how it feels for majority of working people Wed Mar 18 12:47:04 GMT 2015
Think Clegg just swallowed a piece of glass, never seen him look so uncomfortable #Budget2015 . is the truth finally dawning on him? Wed Mar 18 12:44:48 GMT 2015
Very strong ending from @Ed_Miliband stating incontrovertible truth: "Only Labour can be trusted with the NHS". #PMQs Wed Mar 18 12:10:25 GMT 2015
Killer question: "When he makes his next NHS promise, why should anyone believe him? " #PMQs Wed Mar 18 12:08:36 GMT 2015
Wouldn't it be better if Cameron just read out all his kitchen jokes at once & then we can get on with exposing his broken promises #PMQs Wed Mar 18 12:06:52 GMT 2015

@JohnThomasMadde @sunny_hundal I suspect the Scots it alienates were (in the main) the ones who weren't voting for us anyway. Mon Mar 16 18:34:22 GMT 2015
With respect @sunny_hundal I'm on the doorstep across England several times a week. The view is different to the one from your desk. Mon Mar 16 18:32:38 GMT 2015
Its not a fact, its a prediction, and if Yes voters could vote SNP & still get Labour govt they may well do so. @sunny_hundal Mon Mar 16 18:19:39 GMT 2015
@sunny_hundal If you try&ride two horses you fall off them both. The (implied) possibility of the coalition was costing votes in England Mon Mar 16 18:14:57 GMT 2015
The prospect of Lab/SNP coalition loses us votes in England&Scotland @sunny_hundal . It's now explicity dead, lets go for a Labour majority Mon Mar 16 17:45:50 GMT 2015
Don't worry Steven, he can look after himself. Just didn't realise he was so shy about admitting he was a Tory! @GBtennis @GavinBarwellMP Mon Mar 16 17:43:02 GMT 2015
Our position improved in Ashcroft, ICM, YouGov ComRes, so quite happy thanks. @clivewilcock & I never gloat, just aim to redress media bias Mon Mar 16 16:28:41 GMT 2015
@sunny_hundal Well, I am, possibility of SNP coalition was very damaging, he's done absolutely the right thing Mon Mar 16 16:24:19 GMT 2015
So #GrantShapps is pretending to be someone else, @gavinbarwellMP is pretending he's not a Tory. No wonder Cameron daren't do #tvdebates Mon Mar 16 16:21:07 GMT 2015
Thanks @guest_Graham you've got a great team supporting @jackycrawford , we need that seat to be @UKLabour again, I think you'll do it! Mon Mar 16 15:36:15 GMT 2015

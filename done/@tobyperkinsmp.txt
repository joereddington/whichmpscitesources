@tobyperkinsmp
It is possible to have growth and an economy that works for workers. But not with this lot. #CameronMustGo
Good to see two top class @eoindoyle88 goals help #spireites beat Barnsley. Well done @ChesterfieldFC ! http://t.co/qHzkoG5Bv0
Anyone who didn't see excoriating Dennis Skinner anti UKIP pro NHS migrant workers intervention might like to here: http://t.co/T8cBac7zW7
@Phillip_D_Jones 2nd reading today, now has committee, report, 3rd reading, Lords etc.
Glad that Clive Efford NHS bill passed second reading, was proud to vote for it. Am now on way back to Chesterfield for surgery & GC.
Pleased to put on record that 1924 people from Chesterfield have now signed petition in support of Clive Efford's #NHS Bill.
@DavidMHeathcote sure.
@Spike1887 Am following it, Michael, but not able to attend, have sent you a letter on this today.
Really enjoyable panel event on support for freelancers on #NFD2014 with @NickFerrariLBC @NickBolesMP @EnterpriseRocks &@declancurry
@jdav101 I wont RT that, but thank you. And you were right so don't feel bad.
@jdav101 Fair comment.
@GoonerGed But most important thing is that the #VoteforPubs is the last word. He said they were 'considering their response'. Its not over.
Glad to have children from @NewboldSchool here in parliament to watch #PMQs and brilliant @CliveEfford question particularly.
Congrats to @fsb_policy @The_FPB @CAMRA_Official @FairDeal4Locals @si_siclarke & all who campaigned to make parliament listen on pubcos
@0ogywawa It was a cross party amendment. I'm happy to say @GregMulholland1 been a doughty fighter on this as have many others
“@AndySawfordMP: Brilliant win for #pubcoreform in Parliament today. Well done to all who campaigned esp @tobyperkinsmp - great job” Thanks
@MJPearson1976 @micklesb @D_Times Would be glad to hear from him, Michael.
At last, govt finally confirm that debate on #voteforpubs #NC2 will start at or after 1240 & vote around 4pm tomrw. @FDFYL @CAMRA_Official
@FraserNelson The right acknowledges academic inequality then introduces measures to make our society less equal&blames teachers for outcome
Glad that @micklesb and @D_Times are continuing the campaign to ensure every1 who was member of Ches Hotel gym gets their money back.
The @SmallBizSatUK bus is in #Chesterfield next Monday. Come along & show your support for Small firms on 6th December @chesterfielduk
@JWoodcockMP Supporting @SmallBizSatUK definitely, sadly time defeated me on the face painting, much to my frustration!
@Nigel_Farage @oflynnmep Tories well used to spiteful, negative campaigns that backfire, that's why #webackEd trended for four days!
Government in total mess on pubs code. Proposing amendment to bring family brewers back in to code & support for #NC2 coming fm all parties
Ludicrous that a day before Small Business Bill debate, govt still haven't said when votes on pubs code & #NC2 will come. Running scared.
Now that's commitment. Michelle wearing her devotion to @SmallBizSatUK -what are u doing to back #smallbizsatuk ? http://t.co/RDAzws33jo
Really great to be at launch of @SmallBizSatUK in Leeds. Lots of support for shopping local and small on 6th December.
On train to Leeds for launch of @SmallBizSatUK . Will you be shopping with Small businesses on Sat 6th December?
On my first @SmallBizSatUK event of 2014 tomorrow as big launch hits #Leeds Come and join us at Leeds Library from 10am.
I think you were probably the hero of #CorbyEN by-election @AndySawfordMP but @IanAustinMP did a great job & was a great campaign to be on.
@Robfm I would NEVER support a Labour/UKIP government, won't happen.
@Robfm Ed Miliband has called all of the big choices in this parliament-press hacking, Syria, cost of lvng, NHS, EU. Of course I support him
@Robfm No he thinks it will cost him votes so he is willing to back a policy he doesn't believe in, that's why he,like Cameron, is weak.
All the ups&down in the polls not good for blood pressure but LAB lead by 2&4 in YouGov & ComRes respectively. Good vibes on doorstep today.
Teaming up w. @bbuurroowwss @serj4hasland & @AnneWestern at Waterside regeneration site with message about low wages http://t.co/wFjIZyeTAa

Hooray! Eric Varley HOLDS Chesterfield w 15000 majority on #election64
Happy news for @TristramHuntMP we've just held Stoke O T Central on #election64
@MissLauraMarcus Oh Thank you. No-one had told me that #election64 was on. Labour looking good!
@MingerMatt @DerbyshireFBU yes
No Labour voter in Rochester should vote UKIP or Tory, 2 sides of a Conservative coin. No ifs, no buts, vote for @naushabahkhan
@pauleec I'm amazed (but not critical) of fact that its still trending, I think  you read my original tweet differently to how I meant it.
@pauleec @LucyMPowell Moreover I'm saying that discussion with voters about issues perfect antidote to over exposure to politicos or journos
@pauleec @LucyMPowell In so much as any1 I am criticising media who ignore policy debate & overplay personality gossip.
It's simply amazing that #webackEd is STILL trending. On #labourdoorstep tonite voters far more concerned with real life issues than gossip.
Had great day on #labourdoorstep in Birdholme (this afternoon) & Newbold (this evening). w @LabInSpiRed @jellychrissy @rcollinson & friends
@heather_c_c Its working for me, are you on Facebook?
Very revealing that the day @Ed_Miliband confirms he'll never play political games over EU membership. May & Cameron do just that #EAW vote
My letter to the Prime Minister calling for Poppy centrepiece to be displayed in #Chesterfield RT if you agree https://t.co/ZVKdb5xGlz
@PCollinsTimes Tortuous!
@shaunsmith2 Good work
Could someone @EMTrains get a ladder and point Platform 3 sign on Chestfd station towards platform 3 not towards the track, would be helpful
@MBurkeDentonLab I have raised this with staff at @EMTrains . Tell me: 'someone else mentioned it' & 'they are on the case'. Lets see!
So #webackEd trending for 3rd consecutive day. Is it possible that @mailonline isn't really best place to read what Labour members think?
Hey, @Tesco seeing as you're in the mood to #MakeChristmas you could help to @SavetheCrispin and build a Tesco store elsewhere, #MerryXmas
Some great photos by @BARRYDYKEPHOTOS  "CHESTERFIELD REMEMBRANCE PARADE 09/11/2014" http://t.co/E0y5xH5S5J
@BARRYDYKEPHOTOS Is it OK I have display your Remembrance Sunday photos on my Twitter and Facebook pages too, Barry?
@heather_c_c @CliveEfford @daveskid73 Cant think that any of them aren't, its party policy.
Leroy Rosenior very generous in his praise of @ChesterfieldFC after their 6-0 win at Braintree on BBC2 just now #spireites Great stuff!
Back from lovely day of #RemembranceSunday services to find that #spireites won 6-0 and #webackEd is STILL trending 24 hrs on! A good day.
Huge numbers at Chesterfield #RemembranceSunday service & march. Very proud of our town.
At Staveley Remembrance march & service -" We will remember them. " http://t.co/IMeOoOMnvY
I think that @mailonline must be so disappointed that their anti #webackEd  story came same day their poll showed @UKLabour 5 points ahead!
@BenStuart78 Got to be in it to win it, Ben.
@MBurkeDentonLab Good spot. Will pass on. Thanks.
Pleased that part of stunning Poppy memorial will now tour UK. As it's Chesterfield artist we must be 1 of sites. https://t.co/cniCQFfKFU
@daiderbyshire @chesterfielduk @StagecoachYrks Not sure it has to be an either or. Do you have any complaint with the service?
@daiderbyshire @chesterfielduk @StagecoachYrks Fair question. Improving quality improves reliability & passenger comfort which also matter.
Seeing the £1.2M new investment in X17  Chesterfield-Sheffield buses. Leather seats,very nice. @StagecoachYrks http://t.co/L9nbt36pyr
We need a relationship with Europe based on UK influence through the alliances we build- not Cameron's bluster and repeated failure
Ed Balls right to say Osborne is taking Britons for fools on EU bill. Once again Tory isolation in Europe costs us. http://t.co/8Phze1rRrE
Glad that yesterday's nonsense about Ed Miliband has given way to realisation that unity is key to defeating Tories http://t.co/GhL6dq2EcU
Quite the most timid walking you're likely to see today - but well done to @guidedogsNMT & @D_Times for film.  http://t.co/SkJv10iw7b
Good visit to Royal Oak Brampton to discuss Labour's plans to cut Biz Rates & inadequacy of Biz Rates for pub industry.

Had a wonderful night at Remembrance Festival at Winding Wheel, Chesterfield and read by Great Grandfather's war poem 'the Bathe'
Read my November e-Newsletter for people in #Chesterfield here: http://t.co/x2yTEF3e1m
Last day of Small Biz Bill committee, govt has lost 4 votes- any more today? Hoping to be done in time for Chesterfield Fest of Remembrance
“RT @Neilccfc: @DouglasCarswell does anyone actually believe ukip are anti establishment. Surely no one is that stupid?” Douglas does.
Ha Ha @DouglasCarswell The very idea that @MarkReckless is the insurgent and @naushabahkhan is the establishment is absolutely risible!
Quizzed Transport Secretary on local bus services. If you are bus user in Chesterfield, are you satisfied? Let me know.
So #Election2014 is going on in Chesterfield but its Chesterfield, MO and Chesterfield, VA. Hope they all #VoteDemocrat but guess they wont!
Sure @dpjhodges right to say that Norman Baker resignation owes more to electoral salvation than policy differences http://t.co/JxL9TJJu7Q
Pleased that our amendmt to preserve creditors mtgs in Corporate insolvency passed. Though it was due to govt 'FORGETTING' to vote against
So @SuzanneEvans1 @HouseofTwits which major business representative body wants to leave EU? @CBItweets ?@fsb_policy ? @britishchambers ?
I look forward to attempting to persuade govt to back our amendments to insolvency changes tomorrow morning in SBEE Bill committee
Just leaving parliament where I've been working on our amendments to  dangerous govt changes to our world class insolvency regime.
@corinne0950 I worked in private sector for 23 yrs including running own firm for 5 yrs - but if it helps-I'm just leaving work now.
@MhairiHunter @BernardMcEldown You're right, Tory governments always work against working people. Take action- #votelabour in 2015
An emotional, uplifting& heartbreaking day, attending the funeral of my dear friend Cllr Walter Burrows. Overwhelmed by number that attended
@CllrDaveTrimble @leoniemathers Yeah, yeah, we can all say that ;))  My rules are if they're not in the photo,  they weren't there!
@Carrageryr  Amazing effort @JoStevensLabour and great idea #win2015 going for (and achieving) 2015 contacts in one day
@BenKeiller Yes I do support #edm454 @newladdie @paulnadders @MattWrack @rob_blair6670 #fbu FireFghtrs have had rough deal from CONDEM govt.
@paulnadders @LabInSpiRed @jellychrissy Have been twice b4 but let me know when and will try and be there.
OK, so I am calling #labourdoorstep team of the day for @leoniemathers unless any1 can beat this team in Sherwood! http://t.co/T2LJ2JeOGR
How can you tell it's November? Because it's time for the Santa special on @cctrust Chesterfield Canal. http://t.co/odAPu9vxj1
Really good sunny autumnal #LabourDoorstep session in Brockwell with Cllr Ron Mihaly @LabInSpiRed @jellychrissy etc http://t.co/n2OZ20hqDp
Maybe @agriffithsmp your sleepless nights reflect fear of facing your electorate with CONDEM govt record, @JonWheale offers fine alternative
Interesting article showing people believe many things that r not true http://t.co/kHxjlcPbv4 I wonder how that happened @MailOnline ?
How we are WRONG about everything http://t.co/zrXj7CO1Si via @MailOnline
@sheryllmurray Ha ha! defeating govt is 'following Tory lead' these days is it?We stood by promise to Family brewers-that's the main thing.
3am tweets are never a good sign @agriffithsmp . I remain of view our amendmt was better but supporting yours was least bad 2nd option.
The govt were right (finally) to create pub code, mustn't undermine it by over-stretching. Hope they learnt a lesson today.
Won a vote in parliament to exempt Family Brewers and smaller pub-owners from pubco legislation. Important that it does what it promised.
I was pleased to support @AndySawfordMP 's bill to allow public sector to bid to run rail franchise's. An important step forward.
@AndyJReed_OBE @ASAaquatics OK will try.
@Theuniondivvie Was in Edinburgh, Kilsyth, Airdrie & Clydebank just a few weeks ago.
Busy day debating pub companies legislation. Inept drafting of govt legislation actually making it tough to sensibly amend.
@timchambers321 Think it will be important infrastructure project, but would be happy to meet and discuss why you disagree.
In researching it, I learnt that 'antonym' is an antonym of synonym. I'll sleep well tonight.
Just finalising my speeches for today's historic SBEE Bill committee which introduces Pub Companies code legislation at long last.
Kind of guessing all the SNP over-reaction to possibility of Jim Murphy becoming Scottish Labour leader tells you who they really fear.
@EllieAgnew @D_Times @NandosUK Really? You've certainly led a charmed existence!
Watching video of PM being accidentally pushed by a jogger poses significant questions about his security- more interested in opening doors
Really pleasing to see so many people at @EastMidsLabour @UKLabour Conference, pleasure to fllw @GlenisWillmott & talk abt GE15 strategy.

@GwynneMP @HAPPYMEM0R1ES Shadow Cabinet at least!
Nooo! @GwynneMP Rentaghost was a shocking programme, wasn't it? @HAPPYMEM0R1ES
Turnout of just 4000 for Tory Rochester primary, doesn't mean they were wrong to try it, but does suggest they're doomed to defeat.
@Robbill123 Cant just propose policies you don't believe in bcos ppl might vote for them & spend first 2 yrs in power in shadow of EU debate
@Robbill123 @alexmassie Nonsense. Offering EU Referendum is sign of Cameron's weakness. Sticking to what he believes shows EdM Strength
@eBooksUK OK I look forward to seeing the email. Thanks
I didnt commission the poll or write the article Rob, which bit of it is open to doubt? @Robbill123 @alexmassie @Spectator_CH

Will be asking question of SoS Transport over possible cuts or delays to Midland Mainline electrification.
@BrianBartonMK Doesn't sound like very good practice on the face of it.
@Carl_Jacques Yes I know, very sad.
Very sad to hear that my dear friend Cllr Walter Burrows has died. He was a wonderful servant to Brimington, Chesterfield & @Derbyshirecc
Ed Miliband absolutely right to expose Cameron's failure on the NHS at #pmqs
@Broomleigh you are welcome.
Shame govt didn't support amendment to protect SMEs fm late payment. My article on how @uklabour will speak up for SMEs @HuffPostUKPol
Coverage from @Shout99Ltd on Labour's late payment amendment I am moving in Parliament this morning - http://t.co/NNo6CIBXpo
My article in today's @HuffPostUKPol on how Labour's proposals being debated today can finally tackle late payments: http://t.co/UwE0MZvUp4
This morning I'll be pushing Labour's amendment to #SBEE Bill which would finally take action on late payment- cause of 2500 biz failures pa
Thrilled to hear that @patmcfaddenmp will be leading a 'hard-headed & patriotic' pro-European case for Labour. A great appointment.
Details on Labour's bold plans to end the late payment nightmare that takes 2500 firms to the wall every year. http://t.co/DQn9jJIUyg
@FensecLtd Not sure quite what you're referring to as being 'not as simple as that' , but happy to discuss.

Comprehensive win for @Tbrookes157 @thurrocklabour and @ThurrockPolly in #WTSS by election. Congrats all.
Pitiful. I'd actually guess people might think party most trusted on NHS was worth backing under those circumstances. @LouiseMensch
@Cumpedelibero Tories? In Brimington? How very dare you?
@JueFrangos See her? I'm getting shares in her, she'll go far!
@tanyasmith67 Well of course, but how can I say no?
This is a corker: "Why not bring in the best MP we could think of and of course we thought of you.. It is clear you are a very smart man"
Sat on the train home to Chesterfield, reading Brimington JS Year6's 'persuasive' letters encouraging me to visit them. I'm almost persuaded
News that tax gap has GROWN is huge setback for Osborne. Tories- standing up for the privileged few since 1834 http://t.co/6t8NjnwE6j
@JackieDP So when PM denied that Lord Freud's comments reflected govt policy, he hadn't spoken to you?
Am now about to question expert witnesses on pub code, education & insolvency as part of SBEE Bill committee.
Enjoyed speaking on Labour's Evidence based approach to better regulation at #WRFEvents
I think it came as no surprise that Lord Freud thought that, @TimMontgomerie . I'm just surprised he was stupid enough to say it.
@misscadman You are welcome, and well done for advocating for this important cause!
Should Lord Freud be sacked? I voted YES in the @DailyMirror poll! Have your say: http://t.co/gDmanRXLY0
Quite disgusting that Minister Lord Freud said disabled people 'not worth' the min wage. Make sure everyone knows:  http://t.co/p8IKhcueMI
Ed Miliband exposed vile Tory record on disabled workers & continued fall in wages relative to prices. #pmq's
Tories think that UKIP are part of 'the Conservative family', so do I. Lets make sure all @uklabour voters do too.
@GeekyBeardBloke No am big supporter of @BritishCycling but am in Small Business Bill committee on Thursday.
Think a better way of putting it @sajidjavid , is: Labour fought for and saved the union, Cameron and Tories risking it again. @paulwaugh
Really interesting views at #SBEE Bill Committee Evidence sessions on Late payments, Pub companies and zero hours particularly.
@Alice_Pink @cmchughlabour @grahamemorris There were no Labour ones.
Ended today by voting to recognise Palestine in important vote, after the proud duty of introducing newest MP @LMcInnes_Labour to HoC
Brilliant and passionate speech by @Ed_Miliband to Parliamentary Labour Party tonight brought Comm Rm 14 to its feet.
@markc1984 Will get in touch
2/2 hear statements on Ebola and shameless ConDem attempt to change terms of Scottish referendum offer after votes have been cast. Busy day.
On my way down to parliament where today we will introduce new MP @LMcInnes_Labour &some other guy, debate recognition of Palestine & 1/2
@debi77 @LMcInnes_Labour @GrahamJones_MP @JWoodcockMP @LiamDidsbury yes, I'm sat awake at 335! Ha ha. Is it a bit early to go doorknocking?
@LordAshcroft Your H&M poll overestimated LAB by 6 and CON by 6- as campaign lead for LAB in H&M I'd also be interested in discussing it.
Encouraging news the week LAB HOLD & Tories lose RT“@LordAshcroft: Opinium/Observer poll LAB 35%CON 28% UKIP 17% LDEM 9% GRNS 4%”

@colin_fleming Tough opener in Rennes, hoping you can both have a good week.
@AndrewFrost6 @tobyperkinsmp still no progress with Hady school path? This is no way for children to get to/from school> agree, will pursue
So after 4 years of saying the same thing, both Nick Clegg and David Cameron now both believe the Lib Dems 'held back' the Tories. #ConDems
Searching for 1more Labour promise at the end of the rainbow? @jamesgoldstone knows it's #mcinnes2winit in Middleton http://t.co/cCL3XdNyxg
It's eve of poll in Heywood & Middleton, can you come and help @LMcInnes_Labour take the seat and speak up for our NHS? I'll be there.
@newboldsteve Ooh harsh, but partially true. If you are from Newbold, Chesterfield &you want to come& talk, tell me & I'll arrange it.
@JohnBickleyUKIP Of course it is, but you talk like a Tory, think like a Tory and for years you've voted Tory too. That is your right.
No @OliverCooper it's true @JohnBickleyUKIP voted Tory for years: http://t.co/Sh2N7HolfS
Good team on #labourdoorstep in Heywood & Middleton with @LMcInnes_Labour #McInnestoWinit in Bamford. http://t.co/pu982ycETa
Looks familiar? @JWoodcockMP with @LMcInnes_Labour on Woodcock Close, Bamford for Heywood & Middleton by election. http://t.co/D7iJ8tHtRO
UKIP's @JohnBickleyUKIP into realms of fantasy on @BBCManchester . Labour won't support TTIP if NHS isn't exempted. Desperate stuff.
Yes @ChrisLeslieMP it's appalling that press let Osborne make £7Bn of uncosted pledges without any questioning.We'd get very diff treatment.
@Mandi_Tinker Where? What time? Is it in with a chance?
About to go out on #labourdoorstep with @LMcInnes_Labour after she skewered oafish UKIP man @JohnBickleyUKIP on BBC NW Sun Politics.
As anyone who regularly speaks to voters knows; @andrewrawnsley right to say: 'Tories feeling desperate about 2015' http://t.co/fe7Ciuyyfg
@DaveTheArtist @ChesterfieldFC Away at by-election, but sounds like Spireites playing a blinder.
Good session out on #labourdoorstep for @LMcInnes_Labour in Middleton. http://t.co/fyLF3r8knO
Out on Middleton #labourdoorstep in support of @LMcInnes_Labour with Chesterfield, Cardiff C & Mcr Withington Labour represented.
Joy & celebration as @LabourChestrfld scoop first prize in Soroptimist Quiz. Well done to @MikeBarthorpe on excellent quizmastery!
@Tim73Palf Often an immediate (usually very short term post Conf speech boost). See where national polls are post Conf season.
“RT @JL_998: http://t.co/SuLOJhSH49” Great to see @George_Osborne backing @FairDeal4Locals Look forward to his support on pubco SBER Bill!
So @Survation Heywood poll shows LAB UP 10% CON DOWN 14% & @thesunnewspaper says voters abandon Ed Miliband??? Lab lead by 19% over UKIP

So @UKLabour 5pt lead on @YouGov & 6pt @ComResPolls -no sign of #CPC14 bounce yet & a great day on #labourdoorstep for @LMcInnes_Labour
Great town centre speeches from @LMcInnes_Labour & @jimmurphymp fielding questions (& odd heckle) in Middleton today. http://t.co/W5bcfem72m
What? Tories now petitioning their MPs to stay! RT @SteepleTimes: We urge Chris Kelly MP to stick with Conservatives: http://t.co/OrXY5sJNaq
If Tories lose Rochester & Strood, every other Tory MP who is considering defecting or thinks they'll lose will go. At least 10 would go.
Over 150 people on #labourdoorstep for  @LMcInnes_Labour in Heywood & Middleton today. V positive response for Liz in S Middleton today.
@daza66 Yes which was why we voted against it.
Very revealing UKIPs Stuart Wheeler 'our policies, except a few are very similar to the Conservatives' #newsnight
@daza66 Probably not, but Kurdish forces on BBC News were begging West to help. I felt this was least worst option, I hope I was right.
@PaulTMRetail No would be back to approx 2012/3 levels I think. Was announced before govt decision to discount. Happy to meet & talk thru
@PaulTMRetail Cut in 2015/16 of average of £400 pa, fllwd by freeze in 16/17
@daza66 2/2 supporting a Muslim state not attacking one, though obvs some people will put a different interpretation on it.
@daza66 I do recognise that possibility, but not taking action in Syria didn't have opposite effect did it? I'd like this to be seen as 1/2
@daza66 That's one of them, as is fact that ISIL are destabilising entire Arab world and we are supporting Iraqi army at their request
@daza66 If an army was marauding through Britain slaughtering anyone who disagreed with it, I'd think resistance was a pretty good idea, yes
@daza66 No, not at all, and glib to pretend there wont be civilian casualties, but is intended to support ground war of Iraqi govt
Or even better #ff @LMcInnes_Labour and then travel up to 59-61 Market St, Heywood OL10 1HZ  to help her & @UKLabour in the by election
Not usually a great one for #ff but please follow @UKLabour 's candidate in the Heywood & Middleton by election @LMcInnes_Labour
@PaulTMRetail Total nonsense. Short term cut fllwd by freeze for firms with <50K RV & broader review of system to follow.
@daza66 If we'd voted for airstrikes on Syria, would ISIL have been bcos we did that? We've been asked to help by Iraqi govt,, v diff to 03
@JonSWright @EastUpper3 ISIL are killing Muslims alongside people of many other faiths.ISIL don't represent Islam as many UK Muslims hv said
Heading into briefing with @Ed_Miliband  and @DAlexanderMP on motion to support UK airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq

@toryradio We vote on things that don't affect our constituencies all the time. Constitutional change should focus on English devolution.
@toryradio I don't believe in 2nd class MPs and think Scots should have been told if there was a change of this sort in PMs mind.
@hindlea No, that's me done. The Indyref was a near death experience for UK and yet Cameron's response so small minded it's appalling!
With 533 English MPs&59 Scots the idea that England is disenfranchised is laughable, it's as though Cameron learnt nothing fm #indyref
Being the MP for Chesterfield is many things, but always an honour and a privilege and always unpredictable.
It's at times like this when I really realise how blessed I am to do a job I love, that matters to me, that (almost) never bores me.
2/2 SME consultation in Bristol, emotional roller coaster of #indyref, union saved, Cameron double dealing & #labconf14 . No job like it!
Amazing last 12 days.Fm #VoteNo to parliament to 4 events in Chesterfield,campaigning w Liz McInnes in Heywood, @darrenpjones in Bristol 1/2
Re-uniting Britain is about respecting the call for change of those who voted YES in #indyref but also remembering majority voted NO.
I'm all for English Regional devolution but it has to carry support of English people NOT be imposed as a result of #indyref vote.
2/2 but whilst there's a need to get on with reform, also a need for calm reflection on role of MPs #indyref
The #indyref result is a great relief, now must aim to re-unite Scotland&Britain. Need to work together on Brown proposals in good faith1/2
Huge well done to. @jimmurphymp not just for EAST RENFREWSHIRE
NO 63.2 but for way he bravely carried the fight on 100 street corners
@OfficialCK2013 I think it's certainly possible.
Of course @jimmurphymp top drawer both on need for Scotland to focus on what unites not what divides & on need for calm action now. #indyref
@StuartAllenFCMI it's not his fault if only @LabourBIS team are actually listening is it?
I'll verify that @StuartAllenFCMI has always engaged with me and @LabourBIS on unbiased basis, in support of UK SMEs & sales profession.
Had a great day in Bristol w. @darrenpjones -meeting SMEs with @reviveNthrive, #labourdoorstep in Southmead& Biz dinner w. @bw_businesswest
Excellent @philiprossLGC article on @uklabour - 'the party of the self-employed' http://t.co/NJcyUDoyOv
About to speak at SME consultation with @darrenpjones and @reviveNthrive in Bristol.
Good to see last 2 #indyref polls have #voteNo ahead. @yougov 52/48 @survation 53No/47Yes. Hope I might get to sleep now.
Before you #voteyes or #voteNo in #indyref tomorrow watch this compelling speech http://t.co/0utZlqCT5D
I dare #voteyes supporters to watch and share Gordon Brown's speech in advance of #indyref. Passionate patriotic compelling case to #VoteNo
@huntyboy Yes certainly, would be neither in Britain nor an 'independent' Scotland's interests.
Potentially dismal footballing night rescued by two amazing comebacks. #spireites claim a point from 3 down & #sufc 3 in 5 mins for 3-2 win
Was exciting to hear the doors you are opening @AccessibleDS look forward to getting you down to speak to Derbyshire MPs in parliament
@AdamSloan86 No but I think YES campaign have allowed and encouraged intimidatory atmosphere by its activists. I blame Campaign not voters
@AdamSloan86 @Kenny_young Happens too often to not be a deliberate strategy, chilling look at the kind of country YES want Scotland to be.
.@5ivei @leighmp and I and Labour ARE committed to NHS being exempted from TTIP. It is clear this is allowed.
Well done @helenstrust winners of Team Relay at @CDMarathon2014

Terrifying glimpse of Post Yes Scotland: Nationalists promise pro-union firms 'a day of reckoning’ #indyref http://t.co/kBInl10PEL”
We started the @LabourChestrfld New Members Meeting with everyone introducing reasons for joining @UKLabour. Fight Tory inequality was No1.
After a busy surgery, have had very pleasant task of attending @LabourChestrfld New members meeting. Some great new talent in the party.
@KulganofCrydee @BBCSunPolEM Sorry not this time , how have you got that gig?
Met with Derbyshire Police&Crime Commsnr @AlanFCharles . He's playing a tough hand, fighting ever more sophisticated criminals w less cash.
Scottish NHS devolved so it is entirely different. Not affected by Lansley act. @daveskid73
@EnglandforYES No it wouldn't. If RBS stayed in an Indy Scotland, Scottish govt would be lender of last resort for all of their book.
Latest @yougov poll showing NO leading YES by 52 - 48 , will be huge boost for #nothanks . Field work was before Salmond's Black Wednesday.
@EnglandforYES Dream on. I was there for 3 1/2 days this week. Only fear I saw was people frightened to tell YES campaign the truth.
@EnglandforYES YES more interested in stories about 'who said what' than fact that ScotGovt RBS exposure would be 10x size of it's economy.
Sure @georgegalloway will argue a good case for @UK_Together BT isnt a party, its an alliance of people w  different views who agree on this
It is important that licensed trade come out of pubs code (#pubco) with certainty and fairness, not with issue left unresolved.
Today I asked Vince Cable if he would amend pubco legislation to give genuine protection on rents to tenants&lift burdens on family brewers
Topsy turvy #indyref teaches us not to take anything for granted but glad to hear that Survation poll-1st one taken since w/end has No53 Y47
798 #Chesterfield people employed in local convenience stores according to @ACS_LocalShops , http://t.co/UePXCoxxLw they play a vital role.
Enjoyed @TonyBennFilm & panel discussion with production team, #windingwheel #chesterfield http://t.co/fiK6iUJNtH”
This is why Chesterfield people have spoken out to say they dont ever want to be #withoutthenhs https://t.co/YPhCSbrY7x
@chazpoppy @mrs_mack_ It is, rightly, a question for Scots,but knowing that English/Welsh/N Irish people want them to stay has been welcomed
The #indyref has knocked billions off Scottish stocks and off the UK pound. Working for a No vote is vital for #Chesterfield too @chazpoppy
Beautiful background for @bettertogether #LabourNo campaigning this afternoon w @greggmcclymont @SDoughtyMP #indyref http://t.co/Z0YlIt4zBX
Never for one second believed @SimonDanczuk was set to join UKIP.  @GuidoFawkes wrong again." it's just mischievous nonsense."
@DaveB59 No worries.
@DaveB59 Most importantly, should be independent of MP's. Believe overall package will be no better than in 2010.
@DaveB59 Happy with what I signed up for in 2010, MP pay award should be linked to pub sector pay. However this rise comes with other cuts.
#ThreeWordsSheWantsToHear I'm #votingNO Come on Scotland! Don't quit on Britain; we're #bettertogether #indyref
Finally finished a great day of #LabourNo campaigning in Edinburgh. Have exposed Salmond's NHS lies, vital important issue for Labour voters
Shocked to hear that my much admired and respected colleague Jim Dobbin has died. A huge loss to @UKLabour and to people of Rochdale.
Have had great day in Edinburgh with #LabourNo in @marklazarowicz &@IanMurrayMP areas. Just about to head out for 4th Round of the day.
@liberal_leftie No
Have arrived back in Chesterfield after victory in #bedroomtax vote, to do constituency surgery tonight.
@wodens1 Is it really? #fingeronthepulse
Early start for journey back to London, but delighted that vote in favour of softening #bedroomtax was won. Now vote Labour & axe it in full
@lehain that have an identified shortage has undermined the collaborative approach that your MP (and the govt) have claimed to want.
@lehain However I remain of the view that a system which has prioritised Free schools (many in areas without major shortages) over areas 2/3
@lehain @bedsfreeschool Thanks for clarification, my comments were in response to previous remarks about the school. I wish your school well
@annesnelgrove Ha ha, No sorry!
@annesnelgrove  Sorry! Tennis stuff. Guy who is about to reach US Open Semi Finals was beaten by a Brit last year who has since faded.
Sure I'm not first to reflect that a year ago DanE beat him in NY. Now Dan's playing Futures again& he's heading for SF @Barry_FlatmanST
Pleased to see that @jwardhibbert won 2nd Rd today in Tennis today, hope it presages a better run. I think he's player with real potential.
Good luck to @chesterfieldfc boss Paul Cook nominated for MOTM for August. #Spireites made a great start. http://t.co/9tCO9KLvRi
@Jules_Clarke She ignored the whole debate. Spoke at start, then walked out to do a webchat and didn't bother to listen to other speeches
@Barlowfarlow @stvclaire No, the next encounter is for keeps.
Today in @TristramHuntMP debate about increase in infant class sizes I spoke up for the 3 #chesterfield schools with 30+ infants in a class
@CCHQPress Wrong,they're on record as saying will #votelabour in 2015.This resignation IS because of Party leader tho http://t.co/V8K8OehrzE
Will be making a speech in Commons  debate this afternoon on rising Infant school class sizes
It ain't pretty. Tory civil war on Europe rumbles on, here's @PaulGoodmanCH response to moderate @MatthewParris3 http://t.co/RTQpdlQQEm”
At Statutory Instrument hearing on govt changes to Community Interest Co's dividend arrangements. Lot of agreement on importance of CIC's
Murray wins second set 75 too. Strangely looks to be in more and more discomfort the better he is playing.
So #spireites sign Sam Clucas from #mtfc and Andy Murray breaks Tsonga back to go 75 54* up. I've had a worse five minutes before now!
Glad that @portvale fans rep took time to denounce racism at #Spireites game, now PV must catch&ban 'fan' responsible http://t.co/iarwKE1KaI
I hope that Sir Tony Baldry's retirement isn't confused with the NINE Tory 2010 intake in marginals who jumped before electorate pushed.
So its the first day back in parliament since recess and another 2 Tory MPs announce they're quitting on Cameron: http://t.co/T2MUz72Z6I
@Robbill123 He has. Try  http://t.co/ga4MuytAx5 or http://t.co/evSU3l7k0i or http://t.co/vLNkgSjc4z or even http://t.co/ks4ci4TLhC
@SJacksonMP @bbcnickrobinson Julia Drown did 2 terms. I cant think of any election where this many new MPs from 1 party stood down, can you?
@benramsdale Yes, youre misreading things! 9 2010 Tory MPs to step down as they fear defeat- an unprecedented number- all in marginal seats.
@SJacksonMP @bbcnickrobinson Very rare for MP to quit after one term, is there any precedent-& all in marginal seats, very much a story!
.@davemcardle  All of them in marginals, not 1 'safe seat' Tory from 2010 intake standing down. ALL 9 on target list, 6 of them in top 42.
2/2 Kelly (Dudley S), Sandys (Thanet S), Fullbrook (S Ribble), Byles (N Warwicks), Evans (Cardiff N) 6 of them in top 42 Lab targets.
The roll call of 2010 intake Tories not standing in '15- Mensch (Corby); Lee (Erewash), Burley (Cannock), Weatherley (Hove), 1/2
.@WikiGuido You could almost believe they could hear the sound of defeat rumbling inexorably towards them. Will look out for it.
Now NINE 2010 Tories (all in marginal seats) who wont stand in 2015. One day a journalist may write a story about it http://t.co/KYpJBzGSpa
A good afternoon's footie results on my anniversary. @ChesterfieldFC & @StaveleyMWFC with good away wins, and a decent point for #sufc
@G_Skinner @YesScotland @jimmurphymp Also appalling tho' appears to be impromptu attack not planned assault.
I'm shocked by pictures of desperate  @YesScotland mob co-ordinated assault on @jimmurphymp & democracy. Can't see how it helps their cause.
An unusual Saturday: no #labourdoorstep no Sport watching- it's my anniversary! 18 years ago today...
Good luck to @StaveleyMWFC in FA Cup tie at Rainworth, and, of course, @ChesterfieldFC at Port Vale. #spireites

Why don't the @LibDems stop announcing policies? Its getting embarrassing now, no one believes you, no one's listening, just STOP.
@PeakFM @JChubb04 Yeah, yeah, good point, will be on it, once I have done it what do I do, film it and youtube it or what?
@Sue_FD We've had lots to say. Council leader resigned,PCC faced expulsion fm Party, and MP, party leader& others have spoken out.
Interesting article claiming that Clacton is 'most UKIP friendly seat in whole of UK' http://t.co/r0huCGK3xf @stephentall @GoodwinMJ
And apologies to those of a nervous disposition for incorrect use of 'to' rather than 'too'. An appalling indiscretion. #ashamed

Met with Newborough Landscape Protection Group tonight. They stand ready to help @peterboroughcc  develop Plan B for brownfield renewables
@Michael_Heaver I support much of what you believe in but only the Conservatives can get a referendum/out of the EU. Why can't you see that?
@Michael_Heaver Maybe so but won't explain why he declined to offer open primary by example when he moved to safe Clacton seat in 2010.
@Michael_Heaver Not at all. Asked a fair question on open primaries & Carswell threatens to campaign in my seat.He's not the Messiah Michael
@Michael_Heaver @DouglasCarswell Presumably including the voter who told Newsnight "I voted UKIP.The Tory MP has done nothing for 10 years"?
@Michael_Heaver @DouglasCarswell Having traduced his erstwhile colleagues Douglas should expect that they will ask tough but fair questions
@Michael_Heaver @DouglasCarswell Invited by local branch members to regular open meeting and it would have been discourteous to rebuff them
@DouglasCarswell @Michael_Heaver Patrick O'Flynn MEP described me as a "man of courage and principle" so you may need to work on messaging?
@DouglasCarswell incidentally, I congratulated you on Look East on Friday as a diligent and community minded MP
@DouglasCarswell To the point. Why didn't you ask for an open primary for ur substantially altered safe Clacton seat in 2010? Fair question
@DouglasCarswell Cheers but haven't got much need of SW6 based private school CRD researcher policy wonks masquerading as men of he people
@DouglasCarswell You'd be a bit more credible on open primaries if you'd had one in Harwich in 05 or Clacton in 10 and 14, don't you think?
Nice friendly response from residents leafleting the Bluebell estate in the North Ward #Peterborough this lunchtime
UKIP should remember the Cleggasm phenomenon before the last General Election and the SDP 1981-83
So Labour's response to challenge of raising educational standards to compete globally is....getting teachers to recite an oath?'#laughable
This week I'm planning my #Peterborough #LivingWage conference scheduled for next month
I will be campaigning hard with many others in Rochester and Strood to help elect a good hard working local Conservative MP
There's a reason Carswell plotted to defect & fight a by election. He'd seen the polls. Clacton isn't the UK or even like most of England
@Joffff @FriendsofCP I have advised @cambscops that I think they should be doing more to enforce the DPPO in Central Park

@MatthewParris3 does mainstream Conservatives no favours with his shrill and spiteful media outings and disdain for the views of voters
@MGcomment @grantshapps Rescuing country from financial disaster, mass immigration & welfarism under Lab is a pretty positive message Mike!

@ferryoons @snochi @staggiehedge @eddiemair Yes - awkward these free and fair peoples' plebiscites aren't they?
@ferryoons @staggiehedge @eddiemair But we're all in the same country still so that's great isn't it?
Clegg the anti Establishment insurgent? Mmmmm...Westminster, Cambridge, College of Europe, FT journo, MEP. Hardly Che Guevara is he?
Good luck tomorrow to the excellent Conservative candidate for Clacton @GilesWatling #atleasthelivesinthearea
To PM's @eddiemair - Jeremy Hunt is NOT "England's Health Secretary (sic)" but Secretary of State for Health of the UK, which is our country
@wackerlegend Andrew - nice of you to say. Pleased to see fair play has prevailed.
My thoughts on the Energy Park disaster in my Westminster Life column tomorrow in the @peterboroughtel - they're pretty robust.....
@cllrdarrenfower @peterboroughtel Darren - please stop spamming people with your Survey!
Did a quick piece on @BBCLookEast about @peterboroughcc's Energy Park debacle which I predicted in a Parliamentary debate 12 months ago
@PeterboroughCC: stop whining about budget shortfall re #Energy Park. You've had 18 months to develop a brownfield Plan B & failed to do so
Apparently the Lib Dems conference is still on and will reach its crescendo later today. A rapt nation holds it's breath.....

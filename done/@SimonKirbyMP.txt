@ecochris_todd We live in a great city. Brighton & Hove Council needs to have some vision.
@ecochris_todd Higher rise in city centre where infastructure/transport already exists
@ecochris_todd a good question! I'm guessing somewhere in the middle. Shoreham harbour: uneconomic in 2010 but surely different now?
@ecochris_todd the Brighton & Hove Council has the power to pass a robust city plan which protects greenfields AND provides housing.
@ecochris_todd we should be using brownfield sites, considering higher development densities in the city centre
@ecochris_todd there has been very little consultation. I've offered to help broker a deal between all three council parties.
@ecochris_todd  I'm urging Brighton& Hove Council to reject urban fringe development & come up with a robust local plan as soon as possible

@Doctorwhizz I have spoken to Brighton police who are on the case. Council as landowners need to authorise use of full powers available.
I am very angry that the Council do not have a grip on the travellers in Brighton & Peacehaven. Police are hard stretched keeping us safe.
2/2 further illegal use of the site and use their powers with the council to move them on ASAP.

@IanDavidsonMP
Yes I am @gerrymac53, it's vital we fight & stop the Tory sell-off across the border. ANY of us here may come depend on our shared services.
We'll be voting today to save our sister NHS England from the Tory sell-off & protect our NHS from TTIP. #backthebill http://t.co/RrKoZvpcvW
@Calum_Ansell You are aware Brent Crude has fallen by c.1/3 since June? Reduced revenue on a higher tax exposure would harm public services!
@Calum_Ansell Up to 20% of Scotland's tax revenue would be staked on volatile oil prices if it were devolved; it's just 1.5% for the UK.
Today at @CommonsLiaison I asked the PM about the Government's approach to legislating on Smith Commission proposals: http://t.co/MGv9XiyAyl
@Calum_Ansell it would make our revenue and vital things like the NHS vulnerable to oil price shocks & remove vital automatic stabilisers.
@Calum_Ansell devolving revenue power doesn't make revenue go up, it risks it. eg SNP want oil revenue control, but oil price has collapsed.
@Calum_Ansell actually Calum if you vote @UKLabour we will spend £2.5bn more on UK health - with positive grant benefit for Scotland too.
@Calum_Ansell, the SNP *choice* was to cut NHS more than UK. Sharing helps protect Scotland from higher cuts a separate tax base would cause
All the best to Labour's @naushabahkhan in #RochesterandStrood today, fighting back against this failed Tory-led Government. #TogetherWeKhan
@Calum_Ansell if you're worried about the NHS, the people responsible for cutting it are the SNP, as the IFS said: http://t.co/5ocJ1nTgyY
@Calum_Ansell Scotgov alone decides wholly devolved budget spend. If UK policy raises health spend it does not shrink what Scotgov receives.
@Calum_Ansell The Act we're fighting to save the NHS actually puts Health Dept costs up & Scottish Ministers write a wholly devolved budget.
@Calum_Ansell NHS Scotland is a devolved responsibility of Scottish Ministers, not the Tory/Lib Dem Dept of Health: http://t.co/mZURlGCwmx

http://t.co/LbtBhnagcp
http://t.co/tgr4Iht2Nz http://t.co/Bw41wde8aH
A @UKLabour government will cut tax for 24 million people: http://t.co/UiJBoB8pFO
The SNP tax priority? A 3p 15% tax cut for giant UK firms.
With @UKLabour's price freeze—opposed by both SNP & Tories—a typical household will save £120. http://t.co/kqT9FzYDth http://t.co/0DG9DL9svS
#6monthstowin against the Tories & SNP, so that a @UKLabour government can reverse the Tory tax cut for millionaires http://t.co/s4uf4wySeg

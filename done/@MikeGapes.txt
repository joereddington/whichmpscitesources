Was Cameron brain fade switch to Hammers from Villa part of a  deal in return for Karen Brady writing small business  letter ? Mon Apr 27 08:32:10 BST 2015
5.2 million small businesses in UK and yet Tories can only get 5000 (>0.1%) to sign up in support   Why is this lead story on @BBCr4today? Mon Apr 27 07:09:33 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 it was in your White Paper.  Am now going to watch Match of the Day.  Goodnight. Sun Apr 26 22:34:17 BST 2015
How ?  https://t.co/BVQIwwh7l3 Sun Apr 26 22:25:39 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 Thanks for confirming SNP activists want early neverendum and don't accept once in a generation statements of their leaders. Bye Sun Apr 26 22:20:36 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 so in your view was Salmond right or wrong to rule out another referendum for a generation.? Sun Apr 26 22:10:16 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 More sophistry.  Either you accept the democratic will of the Scottish people or you don't.  Clearly you and others in SNP don't. Sun Apr 26 22:00:08 BST 2015
“@PDevlin1: @MikeGapes Where are you getting this once in a generation thing from Mike?” From statements by SNP leaders in the referendum. Sun Apr 26 21:50:27 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 no I mean you accept the "once in a generation" decision of the clear majority of Scottish people and rule out a neverendum Sun Apr 26 21:35:08 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 so nothing to do with second referendum ... Why not rule it out then? Sun Apr 26 20:48:15 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 does SNP win next week and 2016 mean second referendum ? Sun Apr 26 20:29:36 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 as in 2014 there will be no second referendum without legislation to establish it. That requires votes by Westminster Parliament Sun Apr 26 20:08:33 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 that is sophistry of course it's a decision for politicians. Will need agreement of Scottish Govt and Westminster Parliament Sun Apr 26 20:00:56 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 why has Nicola not ruled out a second referendum ? Sun Apr 26 19:55:37 BST 2015
Catching up with @BBCSPLondon on iPlayer  good to see @wesstreeting there with @ChukaUmunna Sun Apr 26 19:53:30 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 but You lost the referendum. Scots do not want separatism. They voted to stay in the UK for at least a generation Sun Apr 26 19:48:32 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 Key is who is biggest party. Tory or Labour. Every Labour loss to SNP helps Tories aim to be biggest party.  #voteSNPgetTories Sun Apr 26 19:37:37 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 If Tories are biggest party they get first chance to form govt. And Clegg has made clear he'd support them. #voteSNPgetTories Sun Apr 26 19:16:35 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 it is going very well. Looks like we will win lots of seats in London and England.  But losses in Scotland would help Tories. Sun Apr 26 18:56:54 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 sorry. Not sure that answers my question... Sun Apr 26 18:45:06 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 if Cameron offers home rule and full fiscal autonomy /austerity in return for SNP support would you agree ? Yes or No. ? Sun Apr 26 18:25:44 BST 2015

@robmcd85 so you say now. But Salmond did deal  with Tories to get his budget through didn't he ?  Are you sure ?   #voteSNPgetTories Fri Apr 17 23:52:11 BST 2015

@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark you lost the referendum. Scottish people decided that there will be no separation. So why not accept result Mon Apr 13 00:46:11 BST 2015
@slinkiwitchx @Js1515John @bigpatmcaleenan @citizentommy @PDevlin1 @scott993 but they did in 79
And in Scottish Parliament under Salmond Mon Apr 13 00:43:27 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark are you talking about a marriage or an integrated complex multidimensional state. Mon Apr 13 00:38:04 BST 2015
@CRRosenstiel @scott993 numbers were not there. But Labour should have refused anyway. Minority govt preferable to dysfunctional coalition Mon Apr 13 00:36:32 BST 2015
@slinkiwitchx @Js1515John @bigpatmcaleenan @citizentommy @PDevlin1 @scott993 under all circumstances ? Mon Apr 13 00:33:13 BST 2015
@CRRosenstiel @scott993 Labour did not have numbers to block coalition in 2010. Fib Dems chose to go into Ministerial coalition with Tories Mon Apr 13 00:32:04 BST 2015
@Js1515John @bigpatmcaleenan @citizentommy @PDevlin1 @scott993 but SNP want separatism not better UK and Tories are quickest route to that Mon Apr 13 00:24:14 BST 2015
@CRRosenstiel @scott993 as opposed to the Lib Dems who will do anything to get into government with the Tories again Sun Apr 12 23:50:43 BST 2015
Enjoyed my jousts with cybernats very revealing about their anti Labour and anti UK narrow minded nationalism. Now time to watch some TV. Sun Apr 12 21:07:58 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark London voted Labour in 2010 and we got a Tory govt too. But Doesn't mean London wants to destroy the UK. Sun Apr 12 21:04:08 BST 2015
@bigpatmcaleenan @Js1515John @citizentommy @PDevlin1 @scott993 so if we are "red Tories" why would SNP want to put UK Labour into govt ? Sun Apr 12 21:01:56 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark and wouldn't SNP be "eradicated" if they put a Tory govt into office ? Sun Apr 12 20:59:21 BST 2015
@button123456 @Pat_167 so you confirm SNP voted with Tories ! Sun Apr 12 20:56:21 BST 2015
@button123456 @Pat_167 SNP voted against Labour with Tories in 1979 and Salmond did deals with Tories in Scotland. SNP do vote with Tories Sun Apr 12 20:45:22 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark if Labour is biggest party should form a minority govt. But not if Scots vote SNP and make Tories biggest party Sun Apr 12 20:43:29 BST 2015
@button123456 @Pat_167 Nonsense.  If Labour biggest party can form minority govt, then up to SNP to choose if they want to vote with Tories Sun Apr 12 20:40:37 BST 2015
@PDevlin1 @David_K_Clark Will be no coalition between Labour and the SNP and no dirty deals either. Labour MPs prefer a minority government. Sun Apr 12 20:38:20 BST 2015
Only way SNP could get Full Fiscal Austerity would be with support of the Tories. That's why SNP would prefer Tories as biggest party Sun Apr 12 20:28:24 BST 2015
What a delusional fantasy world SNP live in.  Labour MPs wont vote for a deal with them. We govern as Labour and block Full Fiscal Austerity Sun Apr 12 20:26:05 BST 2015
@peterhalsey @simonevans117 according to some SNP separatists they apparently do. FFA is Fantasy politics and fantasy economics Sun Apr 12 19:49:07 BST 2015
From the tweets I'm getting it seems SNP have got a serious entryist problem from ultra left groups Sun Apr 12 19:30:01 BST 2015
Do Scot Trots and far left support Full Fiscal Austerity in hope that immiseration of the proletariat will create revolutionary situation ? Sun Apr 12 19:24:50 BST 2015

@ArmitageJW looks like they are better at predicting Hammers games than I am. Sat Apr 11 17:43:46 BST 2015
Yet again we let in a last gasp goal and throw away another to hard earned points in a very poor game Sat Apr 11 17:04:26 BST 2015

Fantastic response outside Exchange this morning. Lots of enthusiastic Labour support. And it stopped raining for us too ! Sat Apr 11 13:54:57 BST 2015
Clear now too why Tories would not let OBR anywhere near costing opposition plans  or their own fantasy NHS promises Sat Apr 11 09:58:14 BST 2015
Clear now why Tories did not want IFS to cost parties election promises.  Fantasy NHS funding. Sat Apr 11 09:55:17 BST 2015

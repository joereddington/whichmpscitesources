“@lindseyhilsum: My blog on how the fall of the Berlin Wall misguided us on the Arab Spring.
http://t.co/9uIRXplTe5”< this is v good.
Hammers lay siege of Villa goal in last ten mins but can't get the winner they deserve it ends 0-0

Am in @CommonsForeign hearing questioning UK European Union Commissioner Jonathan Hill.
Germany does not want UK to leave EU but will not destroy the principles on which the EU is based in order to keep us.
Merkel reported remarks are restatement of longstanding German and collective EU view. A la carte Cameron special pleading will not work.
@Casper10666 @TogetherDarling did you not notice the referendum result.  Scots decided by democratic vote that we are better together.
Thanks to @TogetherDarling for your contribution to saving our UK and stopping global economic collapse. Not yet had the credit you deserve

Excellent response on bright sunny warm November #labourdoorstep in Mayfield this morning with Cllr Parkash main issue raised fly tipping
@StGeorgeofTuf @HouseofTwitsLab @LibDems @UKLabour That's what a constitutional convention is ! A big table with different people round it !
@StGeorgeofTuf @HouseofTwitsLab because Clegg failed to define powers of lords that why we need constitutional convention before change
See Fib Dems are bleating against Labours Radical Plans for a Senate to replace House of Lords. Clegg plan failed because it was unworkable
Will be at Newbury Park station at 9.15 with local community campaigning for @TfLOfficial and Tory Mayor  to provide step free access now.
My comment on the situation in Jerusalem http://t.co/WBbxsq25Gw
@overton951 nonsense.  rouble is at record low against the Euro and falling against dollar. Will Putin admirer Farage welcome this ?
Big news today is Russia raising interest rate to 9.5% as rouble plummets Looks like pressure from EU sanctions is beginning to have effect
Just had hilarious misunderstanding. To clarify last tweet was about Scotland not Fiona Woolf.  @bbc5live
Presumably some @bbc5live commentators and armchair revolutionaries would have denounced Kier Hardie as part of the "Westminster Elite" .
@NickMillward @PeoplesPledgeEU shame I did not have opportunity to put your theory to the test. Seems Tories have dropped their bill.
@NickMillward @PeoplesPledgeEU that's why we elect MPs to subject proposals to rigorous scrutiny and amendment. What's your problem?
Here is my most recent Ilford Recorder column http://t.co/HWc6T9oCSO
@NickMillward @PeoplesPledgeEU I did.  I suggest you read my speeches last year and this rather than indulging in foolish abuse.
Seems I have annoyed some twerps so for the benefit of 38 degrees here is my position on Recall of MPs http://t.co/rMb2TGDPtA

In committee on Broadcasting Independent Productions Amendment Order
Busy morning of meetings here in Parliament and then back to Ilford for a Diwali event
@PeoplesPledgeEU look forward too it.
@PeoplesPledgeEU why don't you get your Tory and UKIP friends to put up candidates against me or stand yourself
“@brighton_alan: @MikeGapes hope you've got a big majority. You'll need it as a cushion” don't even have a Tory or UKIP or LD opponent yet !
“@brighton_alan: @MikeGapes you mean you wanted to talk it out. Scared to let the people decide - you know best of course don't you?” Yes
I put down 65 amendments to EU Referendum bill last week but appears a row in the coalition means I may not get chance to debate them.
In FCO questions I said Turkey must stop sitting on fence and provide support to the Syrian Kurds in Kobane facing existential ISIL threat
@ZacGoldsmith @tmacbond I was thinking of yours.  .....
@tmacbond @ZacGoldsmith I will be voting to defend Parliamentary democracy against big money and extremist groups.
“@mgajia: @MikeGapes does that also include crossrail 2 etc?”no there is a separate Crossrail 2 Appg
Just raised the malign role of the misnamed Taxpayers Alliance a right wing Tory front in the Recall Bill debate
I am delighted to have been reelected as Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Crossrail group
I spoke in support of the climate change act and the EU emissions agreement during the PM statement earlier.
Fallon use of "swamped" not an accident. Thatcher in 70s did same in attempt to win votes from the Nazi NF. He wants to win UKIP votes back.
“@CameronBrownUK: @MikeGapes You wouldn't like that”  you'd probably be better than some opponents I've had.
Will be at Queens Theatre Hornchurch later to support London NE @SSAFA Forces Help concert by Band of the Parachute Regiment
@CameronBrownUK you should put yourself forward
@CameronBrownUK perhaps you as a Tory can tell me why I've got no opponent yet.   Have you given up?
Excellent response on #labourdoorstep in Loxford this afternoon. Important to campaign all year round even in our heartlands
@CRRosenstiel @Sun_Pol_Scot difference is first past the post electoral system for Westminster.
This is a nice article about a recent constituency event http://t.co/WXBMQBE70N
@yebollix I signed letter to Foreign Sec on situation in Swaziland last week.
@Barkingside21 all will be revealed in time. Be patient.
“@Barkingside21: @MikeGapes ... and the answers?”too long for a tweet.
I understand that UKIP want to turn the clocks back to 1953.
Thanks to all who came to One World Week event tonight. Really enjoyed it. Good questions.  Excellent food and songs.
Will be at the Vine Church Ilford this evening answering questions on Climate Change as part of One World Week.
“@NigelpMorris: Best I have seen West Ham play for years! Fabulous victory Q”I agree.
What a great win 2-1 for the magnificent Hammers. Strong skilful resolute and attractive. #COYI
Goaaaal. Sakhoooooo 2-0 to Hammers.
Superb first half of great attacking football Hammers deserve 1-0 lead #COYI
Looking forward to Hammers against Man City at 12.45. Whatever the result will do better than our two home game thrashings last year. COYI
Diwali Mubarak   Lots of celebrations here in Ilford tonight.
If the Tory front misnamed Taxpayers Alliance are supporting Goldsmiths recall amendments then gives me strong doubts
“@AllieRenison: @JimHood_MP @MikeGapes @DanDanMcG huh? it's a fake”thought it was too good to be true.
So to get £1.5 million of EU funding UKIP welcome far right Polish holocaust denier MEP into their group.  But claim they are not racist !
@IslamicSunnah @yvonneridley @georgegalloway @LaurenBoothUK suggest you look at my website where you can see my speech in the debate.
@Graeme__McGuire @DouglasCarswell why don't you stand against me.  It's time to Put up or shut up.
@Graeme__McGuire @DouglasCarswell but I have no opponent yet.  Perhaps UKIP will put its money where your mouth is and stand against me ?
Top four.....great performance by the Hammers.  #WestHam #COYI
Great to hear @BBCLondon949 commentary and goals from Sakho, Valencia and Carlton Cole at Burnley. #COYI
I am quoted in this story about Child poverty  http://t.co/s4k738uMJs
Good response on the #labourdoorstep in Goodmayes this morning with @KamRai7 @Martinxsachs and our Ilford South Team.
@j1mbobber @oowmygawd @DArcyTiP under the Bill commonwealth Irish  Malta and Cypriots can vote but other EU here cannot. Discriminatory
“@TheStaunton: @DArcyTiP @MikeGapes no doubt they will call for immigrants from the EU to also be able to vote”that's another amendment.
@PeoplesPledgeEU @DArcyTiP no the Lords inserted Electoral Commission wording. But this Bill is same as Wharton bill without the amendment
Seems some on the Tory benches don't want any questioning or scrutiny or improvement of this bill.  They will be disappointed.
“@AMMorrisMP: Wonderful speech from @neill_bob - all time classic put down for Labour filibuster @MikeGapes”a question not a filibuster.
@kevin_nicholas5 its second reading.  Suspect Tories will try to move closure to end debate  before 2.30.
Groundhog Day tomorrow as Tories reintroduce flawed foolish EU referendum bill.  Just got my papers from last year out.  Hope to speak on it

Just made an intervention on my good friend @markdurkan to draw attention to importance of European Union role in supporting peace process
Still in the chamber waiting to be called.  Looking increasingly unlikely that I will be.

“@MalcolmFincken: @MikeGapes Why worry? Perhaps you'll be elected unopposed!”that's no fun.....And I want to smash UKIP !
“@kenanmalik: As I was saying about UKIP: https://t.co/L4FnrjYtoh”this is very good.
Only 7 months to the General Election but so far no candidates announced against me.  No Tory No Lib Dem and no minor parties. Come On !
@oflynnmep Who is your candidate against me?  Are you scared to spend on campaigns opposing pro Europeans in  multi racial diverse London?
Please to attend Festival Eucharist celebrating the centenary of @StMargaretIG1 and meet so many old friends
Enjoyed my visit to the Newbridge school Autumn Fete this afternoon.
Another great evening at the RAFA for the Redbridge Green Fair  Acoustic Music Club listening to Unhalfbricking http://t.co/HXptKDOYq8
Labour will only defeat UKIP bile by standing firm on values of tolerance equality and internationalism not by joining a race to the bottom
Pleased to hear that UKIP are going to fight all  650 seats look forward to smashing them in Ilford South.
@MichaelLCrick Labour won Tories third Lib Dems v poor fourth
UKIP have clearly won many votes from collapse of Tories and Lib Dems and getting most of the anti Labour vote
Delighted that @LMcInnes_Labour is new MP for Heywood and Middleton with increased share of the vote
It's been a long  day on Middleton #labourdoorstep my pedometer says I've done over 32000 steps today. Looking forward to a victory beer
Good response on #Labourdoorstep #HeywoodAndMiddleton this afternoon despite heavy showers.
Will be on panel at NUT Education Question Time event in Barking at 6.30 at Broadway Theatre
So anti economic  growth Fib Dems vote down airport expansion.  Clegg and Laws will betray it if they can get into Tory Govt next May
Cable says Tories are lying over tax cuts. Is that the same as Cable and Clegg lying over tuition fees
Speaking with terrorists may be appropriate when there is territorial basis for a solution but not with IS ideological existential nihilism
@ali_alirobb @Delayed_Again @KhayerChowdhury @wesstreeting @greateranglia just the part from Liverpool Street via Stratford to Shenfield.
Afternoon in Commons clearing casework, signing letters, responding to invitations and submitting reimbursement claims for office bills
@KhayerChowdhury @wesstreeting @greateranglia @Delayed_Again Abelio are losing the contract from next April. Crossrail will take over
Am at City of London Guildhall about to hear speech by France PM Manuel Valls on Growth and Reforms
Clegg and Cable so angry at Tory policies will immediately give up ministerial cars and salaries and go into opposition now.  Why not ?

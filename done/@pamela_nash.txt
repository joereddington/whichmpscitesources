.@Ed_Miliband on Sturgeon. She is asking people to gamble on getting rid of the Tories, we can guarantee it #BBCDebates Thu Apr 16 21:20:41 BST 2015
.@Ed_Miliband to Farage "I want to address people's fears, you want to exploit them." #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:08:06 BST 2015
Enjoyed taking some time out to paint with kids at Little Treasures nursery with @JimForScotland & @greggmcclymont ! http://t.co/KLKykCILsB Tue Apr 14 12:28:43 BST 2015
.@cathyjamieson has done an incredible job on #Scotland2015 setting out our focussed funding on the NHS and opportunities for young people Mon Apr 13 23:16:30 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland calls clearly on UKIP to stop demonising immigrants #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:58:47 BST 2015
Sturgeon says she is relieved she is on the opposite side to UKIP's Coburn...except on Barnett Formula! #BarnettBombshell #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:53:04 BST 2015
Our NHS is already in crisis. The SNP's #barnettbombshell = cutting more than half our NHS. #NHSSOS #LeadersDebate http://t.co/M7ynl2hOxk Wed Apr 08 21:47:03 BST 2015
@Js1515John @JohannaBaxter @JimForScotland we didn't Wed Apr 08 21:44:08 BST 2015
SNP will fund pensions with volatile oil revenues instead of stability of Barnett. #barnettbombshell #leadersdebate http://t.co/M7ynl2hOxk Wed Apr 08 21:40:51 BST 2015
Sturgeon confirms SNP'd vote for Full Fiscal Autonomy, scrapping the Barnett Formula, same as UKIP, costing ¬£7.6bn every year #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:25:01 BST 2015
Pathetic from David Coburn attacking foreign aid- Labour are very proud of establishing DFID, helping the most vulnerable & aiding stability Wed Apr 08 21:20:56 BST 2015
@cymro29 @scottishlabour @JimForScotland Aye. Bit tongue in cheek, first clue being that I have been a Labour MP for 5years. Tue Apr 07 22:06:17 BST 2015
.@Record_Politics clear win for #Murphy. Only leader with a plan for investment in Scotland, in our services and our people. Tue Apr 07 22:00:58 BST 2015
Right, @JimForScotland has me convinced! #ScotDebates http://t.co/1yOGMYOOSg Tue Apr 07 21:56:33 BST 2015
Don't wake up to this on 8th May http://t.co/cJgHNo7S0l #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:54:37 BST 2015
@bigjackthelad which question? Tue Apr 07 21:49:51 BST 2015
@JimForScotland is spot on Tue Apr 07 21:47:31 BST 2015
Funny that Nicola saying that she does not want a Tory Govt but is asking English voters to vote Green and the Welsh to vote Plaid Cymru Tue Apr 07 21:46:53 BST 2015
Hear hear Jim! @JimForScotland - "Our Coalition preference is with the Labour Party in England and the Labour Party in Wales" #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:45:24 BST 2015
SNP Scottish Government kept ¬£444m back and did not spend it last year. WHY? #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:44:01 BST 2015
I agree Nicola, it was outrageous that LibDems broke their promise to students. They are not alone... http://t.co/79PWFLGJJH #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:41:09 BST 2015
Scottish Labour made tuition free. I remember the SNP's Dump the Debt campaign-my student debt was not dumped #brokenpromise #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:36:20 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland mentions our brilliant Future Fund policy-¬£1600 for every 18/19 yr old not in education to get training or start a business Tue Apr 07 21:34:14 BST 2015
SNP have no right to boast about education- increased school class sizes, 140,000 college places cut, insufficient bursaries #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:03:43 BST 2015
Proud that @scottishlabour made tuition free&we will now go further by increasing bursaries&helping young people train&start businesses Tue Apr 07 21:01:11 BST 2015
Offensive to hear SNP call for votes for them for a "Scottish voice". Last time I checked, Chapelhall was in Scotland- I am a Scottish voice Tue Apr 07 20:59:29 BST 2015
@claramof @JimForScotland happy to meet and discuss with you :-) Tue Apr 07 20:54:59 BST 2015
.@gerrygreen1988 @UKLabour and a happy Tuesday to you too. Tue Apr 07 20:51:05 BST 2015
@claramof @JimForScotland Not true! The minimum wage is raised gradually and calculated on what small businesses can afford & not lose jobs Tue Apr 07 20:50:14 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland speaks passionately about our plans to abolish exploitative zero hour contracts, raise wages&remove the need for foodbanks. Tue Apr 07 20:44:18 BST 2015

Nicola and Ruth trying to gang up on Jim on bogus coalition arguments #voteSNPgetTories #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:22:42 BST 2015
Of course the biggest party will form the Government. The electorate will not accept otherwise. Tue Apr 07 20:21:08 BST 2015
.@MaragDhubh eh? Tue Apr 07 20:12:44 BST 2015
Sadly I have met many struggling like the lady @JimForScotland describes. A Labour Government will raise wages&scrap exploitative contracts. Tue Apr 07 20:11:15 BST 2015
Very good point from audience member- not every situation is predictable; values are as important as policies. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:08:38 BST 2015
@scouser_1987 Thank you! üëç Fri Apr 03 20:00:43 BST 2015
Farage's HIV comments were vile&ill-thought out. Even with his selfish mentality, not treating HIV would help spread the virus #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 21:23:11 BST 2015

Taking evidence this morning in @CommonsSTC on modern attitudes to #GMCrops. What do you think?
.@MarkCosens I believe it was of the previous Foreign Secretary.
.@Out4Indy @ayestotheright @DazzaY you're conflating the terrible attitude of a Tory FS with the dedication & hard work of our embassy staff
Astonishing-just asked Foreign Secretary what recent action he had taken on anti-LGBTI Legislation. He could not answer, not could his team.
Minister has confirmed that there will be in an Independent Panel Review of the documents held on Hormone Pregnancy Tests #Primodos

Thoroughly disappointed in Salmond's tone in defeat. Seems to be trying to stoke divisions rather than unite the people of Scotland.
@frankmugisha this has made my morning! See you in Manchester xx
Hi @AngusMacNeilMP are you advocating Scots stop paying their TV License, or is there another reason you are RTing people suggesting this?
Everyone who came out&voted yesterday showed their passion for making #Scotland the best it can be, now lets all work together to achieve it

@y2hez @Alison_McGovern I voted against Bedroom Tax 7 times, introduced a Bill to ban it&brought my committee to Airdrie to look at impact.
Alastair Darling, like myself, is passionately supporting Scotland in the UK as it offers the best future for our constituents #bbcindyref

@JamesMcPake6 :-)
@LauraDominici :-)
@DavidPBMaddox only for those, such as Salmond, who want our shipyards depending on ferry contracts.
Our shipyards need MoD contracts to continue; which just wouldn't be awarded to Scotland as a foreign country. #bbcindyref
@JamesMcPake6 cheers!
Why did our newest Scottish ferries get built in Germany and Poland? #bbcindyref
Biggest threat to Scottish NHS is Salmond, independence would mean a huge black hole in our public finances.#bbcindyref
Absolutely disgusted at continued scaremongering by SNP on the NHS. NHS is devolved, & spending in England is not being reduced #bbcindyref
@bigmikeybhoy He absolutely does, as do I.
@bigmikeybhoy are you saying Darling does not have Scotland's interests at heart?
Em, no. We won't have a currency union. #bbcindyref
Mock shock from Salmond. We could use ¬£ without permission;but we'd have no say in it's management,&BofE'd have no responsibility to us.
Nice, Salmond shouts over the chair. #bbcindyref
Salmond misleading public. No-one saying oil's a curse;but it's volatility means that we can't base our economy on it; it's value is a bonus
Darling gets to the centre of the argument.His priority is a fairer society, Salmond's is creating a separate state #indyref #bettertogether

Is this why Salmond has been in hiding? #ScotDecides
Exactly. People of Scotland deserve a grown up debate. #ScotDecides
That's his opening question? Ha! #ScotDecides
We deserve an answer on the currency. Unbelievable. #ScotDecides
Desperation from Salmond here, blaming Darling for the global financial crisis. #facepalm #ScotDecides #NoPlanB
Salmond is totally laughable here. No Plan B. The Scottish economy would in dire straits. #ScotDecides
.@_katedevlin more than half voters in Scottish Parly 2011 election disnnot@vote SNP either #ScotDecides
Salmond NOT ANSWERING THE QUESTION. No Plan B; trying to mislead  the audience on out of context Darling quote. #ScotDecides
Darling points out the #Pound belongs to the UK, not England, Scotland, Wales or N.Ireland #ScotDecides
Actually, most Scots did not vote for SNP in 2011. #ScotDecides
I can categorically say I have NEVER in 7 years of working in London had a Scottish note refused from a taxi driver. #ScotDecides
Spot on Darling! "I didn't vote for him (Salmond) but I accept I'm stuck with him, that's democracy." #ScotDecides
Darling points out that Scotland's pensioners better served through the stability of the UK #ScotDecides
Darling points out that Salmond has failed to answer important questions over past two years. #ScotDecides

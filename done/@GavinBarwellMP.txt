@AllotmentSlim I'll get on to the Council
@jon_ellacott @timothygodfrey @CroydonSean It's in a report one of their colleagues has published Jon. Disgraceful isn't it?
Enjoyable morning presenting funds raised for local charities on behalf of #Croydon's Yorkshire Building Society: http://t.co/DyaDHLnZF2
@mrchrisjohn https://t.co/7KSF03z4H2
@mrchrisjohn Occupational data tables show the rise has been in 'managerial, professional or associate professional occupations'.
@mrchrisjohn http://t.co/IlqxotHmJX
@Papos29 Recovery has certainly benefited the 1.7 million people who have jobs who didn't under Labour
@mrchrisjohn Source is the ONS Labour Market Statistics
.@HarrietHarman Never mind that, what have you got to say about John McDonnell's disgraceful comments about Esther McVey?
Good to speak to the inquisitive students of @CTC_London this afternoon. #Croydon http://t.co/nYWsOWJAkc
@davidwhite020 a) don't claim sole credit b) no - IFS have said slow wage growth is direct result of recession under last government
@Ozgoz Wrong - three quarters of the jobs created are full time and that proportion is rising
@pesteringUKgov Inequality is a problem though it has fallen slightly. Wages just beginning to rise by more than inflation
@mrchrisjohn Wrong - two thirds are in higher skilled (and therefore higher paid) occupations
@98rosjon Hard work of thousands of businesses, Government economic policy & improved international economic climate
Great to speak to @OasisAcademySP Student Leadership team this morning. Lots of questions about @CroydonPartners! http://t.co/fAZAOAxBFb
Unemployment in my constituency is a third lower than a year ago: http://t.co/6LdF5pRpP9 #Croydon http://t.co/u1eeEp2rij
More great news re jobs - unemployment in #Croydon Central fell by 7 per cent in the last month & is now 45% lower than it was under Labour
Unsure how to vote next May? Unemployment rose by nearly half a million under Labour; it's down by more than that under us & falling fast

@RossHaynes92 Keep up at the back Rosco. It was Labour who tried to stop the House voting tonight
@tedewey If her support for Ed goes without saying then why sign the letter today? Come on Tom you can do better than this
@tedewey Then why didn't she just say so? Bizarre media handling to refuse for 3 days then do it when ordered to
@davidwhite020 Trivial? When you canvass you must find the same thing - many Labour supporters think you have the wrong leader
@MarioCreatura She's clearly had the phone call from Labour HQ because she has now signed it @davidwhite020
This is the letter to which she has been forced to put her name http://t.co/gySg63IUXD #Croydon
Having refused for several days to say she supports @Ed_Miliband my Labour opponent @laboursj has now been forced to do so by Labour HQ
Fellow south Londoner @ChukaUmunna lets slip who he wishes was leading Labour http://t.co/5nTZklXY6Z Labour voters in #Croydon say the same
@jon_ellacott @MarioCreatura Fair enough but question is whether his own candidate in #Croydon Central supports him!
@jon_ellacott @MarioCreatura Given a vote for her is a vote for @Ed_Miliband to be PM I would say it's highly material!
@Canknitwillknit My view is that councillors with links to the applicant should not take part in the decision

@bieneosa That's unavoidable - how people vote is influenced by perceptions of both national and local brands
@Hushbone The recession happened under Labour. Inequality has fallen under the Coalition. But don't let facts get in the way of your ranting
@CortinaMK32000 So now you've read the poll & realised it contradicts your ill-informed views you've decided it's all lies...
@CortinaMK32000 Wrong. Ashcroft poll shows that in Croydon UKIP take votes disproportionately from Tories. People voted UKIP & got Labour
@Hushbone Also the bit where he said our economy was "sinking". Wasn't saying that during greatest recession in living memory under Labour
@Hushbone I particularly enjoyed the bit where he initially said the media were making it all up then admitted some Labour MPs were briefing
@CortinaMK32000 @HouseofTwits Lots of former Conservatives voted UKIP in Croydon in May. Result? 0 UKIP councilllors, Labour council
@offasreturnII @Mr_Chas If you look at the data tables I linked to you will see that in my seat at least that is demonstrably untrue
Poll shows if Croydon Conservative voters switch to UKIP, theyâ€™ll wake up with Miliband as PM: http://t.co/SxOQOEA8jC http://t.co/EJ8GeVFChn

@LFC196351 @PaulRutherford8 @davidwhite020 and also for the fact we went into the recession already with a deficit
@LFC196351 @PaulRutherford8 @davidwhite020 Didn't say it was caused by Labour - but they're responsible for it being deeper here

@KulganofCrydee We also don't control how many Brits leave the UK. One reason why net migration is still high is emigration has been falling
@KulganofCrydee My tweet you have responded to *clearly acknowledged* that we don't currently have control over migration from the EU
.@Budhistrider Depressing beyond words to find people still judging people's worth by the colour of their skin in 2014
In that context, bizarre for @Ed_Miliband to raise issue because only answers are reform of freedom of movement, Brexit or more emigration!
Immigration from outside EU lower than under Labour; numbers from EU (over which we have no control) higher because economy doing well #pmqs

Lots of people in my timeline getting very excited about tonight's poll. #Calmdown It's one poll - wait to see if it becomes a trend
@MSmithsonPB Only if you assume a uniform swing
My #VisionForCroydon: 'Give more priority to tackling violent crime including domestic violence and rape': http://t.co/cwsFcXtdbg
What we've learnt from the Labour and Conservative Party Conferences http://t.co/80kWnstr8K #Croydon
@CnWilkinson Absolutely
@GreenPeterU Obviously - assuming it didn't lead to you losing your job! Minimum wage increased today
@richsimcox I think you've missed the point: the same is not true of the ECHR
@richsimcox It does it *by legislating*
@tomblackuk If you think otherwise, what things shouldn't a democratically elected government be allowed to do?
@tomblackuk I would fight tooth and nail against any attempt to deny equal rights but no Parliament should be able to bind its successors
@AndrewFisher79 Parliament can't pass a law that conflicts with a ECHR ruling whereas it can overturn the ruling of a British court
@AndrewFisher79 There's a big difference and you know it but you can't be honest about your position because you know the public don't agree
@lozchez_ That is what David Cameron has proposed today - raising it to Â£12k
@tomblackuk Yes but people could vote for candidates who promised to reintroduce it
@tomblackuk ECHR is telling us to change law on prisoner voting even though vast majority of MPs support it. Undemocratic
@tomblackuk Yes, but if Parliament doesn't agree with the ruling of a British court it can change the law to make its view clear
@tomblackuk  The distinction is relevant because the laws British judges interpret are ultimately determined by people you elect
@AndrewFisher79 @Kevin_Maguire So you're admitting we can't pass any law that is in conflict with HRA even if voters want us to?
@AndrewFisher79 @Kevin_Maguire But why should European judges not British ones?
@AndrewFisher79 @Kevin_Maguire And you think these decisions should be made by European judges (some of whom are not lawyers) why?
Labour say they're on the side of the working man, but the truth is they taxed people on low incomes very heavily. We're putting that right
"If you work 30 hours a week on minimum wage you will pay no income tax at all. Nothing. Zero. Zilch." #mykindofConservatismÂ #Croydon
@AndrewFisher79 @Kevin_Maguire No, the Court also sometimes tells us to change our laws
@Kevin_Maguire As does this one. Question is who decides what they are: people you elect or judges in Strasbourg?

A Conservative Government will help under 40s to buy their first home http://t.co/nT2pM4g9XB #politicalstorythatactuallymatters #Croydon
@theboywilliams Yes (but it's not going to happen - these people are leaving because we aren't moving to the right as they would like)
@forcesbiznet @DPJHodges You didn't hear this at the time? http://t.co/ao85FFE7FF
@ea_akin Likewise. Will be in touch to fix up more detailed discussion
.@CllrTony In. Your. Dreams. Will never have anything to do with a bigot like Farage #Croydon
@A_C_McGregor Actually the effect of these defections is to rid the Conservative Party of those who might have put off sensible centr types
@yanders76 Yes, whips act as the tellers for the votes and I was on duty today
Why I voted in favour of airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq #Croydon http://t.co/DbbtN3Yyrp
@davidwhite020 There are significant differences - not least that the Iraqi Government is asking for our help on this occasion
In the House of Commons listening to the Prime Minister making the case for military intervention in Iraq to protect our national security

@davidwhite020 Not just the centre-right press - pretty much every paper
Great to visit Addington High today & meet new headteacher Martin Giles. Very impressed with his plans to raise standards #Croydon

Pictures from my campaign launch on Monday: https://t.co/ONLtvzoY9g #BackBarwell2015 #Croydon
@Cleanupourtown I'm focusing on people who think I do a good job & rightly worry about Ed Miliband being PM - includes some '10 Lab voters
@seedbedlearning Good point - will address in final version
.@Ed_Miliband "forgot" to mention the deficit and immigration in his big speech yesterday http://t.co/Y01lSQh4Vc Unbelievable #Croydon
Will travellers who left Spring Park like this be prosecuted? @LabourSJ said lack of respect wouldn't be tolerated http://t.co/CfTF5y0VXm
@Matt_Blanshard @UKIPCroydonCent Lived in Central most of my life now just over border. Family still live there. Wife works in New Addington
@InsideCroydon Lol! No, you published this information on your blog on 9/9. Your kids did well given paternal genetic inheritance :)
@InsideCroydon 3. You attack me for exercising choice when you sent your kids to a grammar/private. So who's the real hypocrite?
@InsideCroydon 2. We chose a grammar in a neighbouring borough. I am campaigning to have one in Croydon. How's that hypocrisy?
@InsideCroydon You said "not a school in the borough good enough" If that were true, would not have picked any Croydon schools in our top 6
@jeannegenius @InsideCroydon And also untrue - we included several Croydon schools on our application form. Younger two go to local primary

@davidwhite020 Now you're being silly. No-one was "dragged" into the event. I asked people if they would be happy to do it & they said yes
@EarlJacqueline I've reported it to the Council for you. Hopefully it'll get cleaned up very soon. @CroydonCouncil
Looking forward to visiting the outstanding Coloma Convent School for Girls this morning with Education Minister John Nash #Croydon

My speech at the formal launch of my re-election campaign last night http://t.co/j2gNGE58xQ #Croydon
@AnitaJMurphy I talked about need for a new A&E Department at our hospital + the video had lots in it about why I'm passionate about the NHS
... @AzharChaudry786, @MissStJames and @MayorofLondon!
Special thanks to all the speakers John Burton from @CroydonPartners, @98rosjon, @ElizaMargarite, Maureen Martin...
Thank you to the almost 400 people who came to my #BackBarwell2015 campaign launch evening. Amazing night: http://t.co/4UOFDPJ1mj
@davidwhite020 I'm setting out why I'm re-standing, which is political, but I also want to showcase some great things happening in #Croydon
My #VisionForCroydon: 'Transform the environment in the town centre to make it a much more attractive place to visit' http://t.co/cwsFcXtdbg
@Robbill123 @BillEstersonMP @IanMearnsMP That's as absurd as the point they were trying to make
"@BillEstersonMP: .@IanMearnsMP says Tories don't appear to like children #Lab14" << this is what passes for the main opposition
@ibedi67 Many thanks - much appreciated
Big day today. @MayorofLondon is coming to #Croydon this evening to formally launch my re-election campaign #bettergetthespeechwritten
Delighted Tim Pollard & Sara Bashford elected new Leader/Deputy Leader of #Croydon Conservative councillors #constructiveopposition
@JamieMcBastard But in one sense you are right - lower paid get more benefit from personal allowance increase than rate cut #progressive
@JamieMcBastard Increasing the personal allowance cuts the amount of income tax people pay???
@Privateallergy Giving someone a contract to deliver an NHS service is not remotely the same as selling something. Stop misleading people
@Privateallergy Let's try one more time. Can you list which bits of the NHS have been "sold off"?
@JamieMcBastard And I am happy to devolve power for you to tax people lots more in Scotland if you want to
@JamieMcBastard I support lower taxes for everyone but if you're talking priorities cost of tax cuts for low paid ~50 times cut in top rate
@Privateallergy What have we "sold off"?
@ashley_brown Also trust in politicians is so low that if we said "We'll get on to England later" no-one would believe it
@ashley_brown If the Conservative Party put its interests first it wouldn't have campaigned for 'No'
.@Splogansrun Yes - I was door knocking in Hartland Way yesterday and have reported it to the Council but thanks for checking I was aware
@ashley_brown AV referendum/fair constituency boundaries shows danger of separate timetables
@Samson1176 Yes - last thing we need is another layer of politicians
Morning @SteveReedMP. Seen polling in Sunday Times showing Labour voters agree with PM's position on English votes for English laws?
Good to see @Ed_Miliband announcing minimum wage policy from our Vision for Croydon manifesto. He opposed tax cuts for low paid though
@davidwhite020 Polling shows this is a false narrative
@Chris1966 I am not in favour of another Parliament - we don't need another tier of politicians. Just English MPs voting on English laws
@anthonyjwells :)
@davethered55 ??? Labour perfectly capable of winning majority in England if it has credible leader - as Blair proved
@SteveReedMP Quite the reverse: we want to end the unfairness of Scottish MPs voting on English laws when same is not true other way round
@timothygodfrey Last time I checked Conservatives didn't have any Irish MPs. Principle clear: English laws should be decided by English MPs
@axlripley My point is Brown continuing to pretend he is in charge will damage prospects of achieving what he wants
@axlripley ??? Polling shows vast majority of 'No' voters made up their mind well before polling day
Someone really needs to tell this guy he is not the Prime Minister anymore http://t.co/owDFRAAkqV
@SteveReedMP It's like the Council's fairness commission - another talking shop to cover up for your inability to take a decision
@SteveReedMP Says the man who is promoting his leader's latest weird idea...
@PeteWishart Interesting that 18-25s behaved differently to other younger voters. What are margins of error + do you have link to data?
@markpack It is in part - as some of your MPs have had the good sense to recognise
@SteveReedMP But just to be clear: you agree Scottish MPs shouldn't vote on English laws when further powers are devolved to Scotland?
.@SteveReedMP He was clear promises to Scotland will be honoured but in a way that is fair to England. Surely even you can't object to that?
Encouraging to see some Labour & Liberal Democrat MPs supporting English votes on English laws. @ed_miliband has badly misjudged this issue
@anthonypainter @Dannythefink @TimMontgomerie A Lab/Lib coalition legislating for England via Scottish votes would be a much bigger problem
@anthonypainter @Dannythefink @TimMontgomerie Why would that necessarily be a problem? Parties would have to compromise
@pete_goddard You try to get away but it sucks you back in...
@cleanstreetstu Unlike you to duck the question. Do you agree with your colleagues that landlords will pass cost on to tenants or not?
My #VisionForCroydon: 'Deliver the redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre by Westfield/Hammerson as soon as possible' http://t.co/cwsFcXtdbg
@tedewey And if I were doing your job I wouldn't want to draw it to more people's attention but by all means keep going
@tedewey It was only criticism of her in 20,000 word document - because it's the one thing she's said which was a terrible misjudgement
@alexburridge People who tweet about politics not everyone! The Council is clearly hoping tenants will blame their landlords
@alexburridge per property
@tedewey When Sarah issued her statement it was public knowledge several people seriously injured so quite fair. Seems we hit a raw nerve...
.@CllrTony Not sure private tenants will equate you putting up their rent by Â£200 with being "on their side". Classic Labour stealth tax
@cleanstreetstu So you don't agree with your colleagues and Council officers that landlords will pass cost on to tenants?
#Croydon Labour have now admitted their plan to licence all private landlords is likely to lead to Â£200 rent rises. Time to ditch the policy
My #VisionForCroydon: 'Deliver the redevelopment of the Whitgift Centre by Westfield/Hammerson as soon as possible': http://t.co/cwsFcXtdbg
Strong statement from PM "Millions of voices of England must be heard..this must take place at the same pace as the settlement for Scotland"
Delighted Scotland voted to stay in UK. Now need to address concerns of 45% who voted 'Yes' & those of English voters to secure our Union
@CroydonSean ...any landlords who will take them and are having to move out of the borough. Stupid and tragic
@CroydonSean ...looking to rent together. Croydon Council counts this as an HMO; most councils don't. As a result, they can't find...
@CroydonSean Let me give you an example of damage well-intentioned regulation can do: have a case at the moment 3 young professionals...
@CroydonSean I oppose a borough-wide scheme yes. May be a case for doing it in specific areas where there's a problem with rogue landlords
.@CroydonSean You don't need to hit all tenants to deal with bad behaviour of minority of landlords. Real reason you're doing this is Â£Â£Â£s
@Dscaper Price controls sound attractive but in the long-run they're counter-productive. Fewer people rent out their property so rents go up
.@CroydonSean I am on the side of tenants. I want to stop people like you hitting them with a Â£200/year stealth tax #Tenanttax #CroydonRents
.@CroydonCit No it's not. They admit themselves that their policy will put rents up #croydonrents
Unemployment in #Croydon Central falls again.  Won't be long until it's half the level it was when Labour left office http://t.co/oEnBBH4M1S
Unemployment in #Croydon Central falls yet again: http://t.co/oEnBBH4M1S
@davidwhite020 Implicit in that is that it will be a better future without us?
@alexburridge @davidwhite020 EU has its flaws but it is certainly not to blame for all our problems
@rustyguillotine Breaking up the UK is not "decentralisation"
@davidwhite020 What do you think it's about if not 'Scotland would be better without the rest of the UK'?
@Thekdawggg England didn't vote for Gordon Brown, but that didn't make us blame Scotland for our problems
.@Trudgin I like living in one of the most diverse parts of the country so you might want to rethink that one

Nationalism is an unpleasant political ideology that involves blaming foreigners for your country's problems. Hope Scots reject it today
Really enjoyed visiting local business @WilliamMurrayPR today. Thanks for your hospitality & let me know if you'd like to visit Parliament

Read my #VisionForCroydon: http://t.co/mnNMPpgZNL #BackBarwell2015
@SquareBiz_T I explained why when I emailed her to inform that I would not be appearing on her show
@martinangus No, I informed Croydon Radio before that story broke
@Waddon I have been publicly arguing for most of them well before that document was published so perhaps the other way round :) Examples?
@davidwhite020 Very happy to do so. Some hustings already in diary, sure there will be many more - but moderators must be neutral
@TonyLeeMartin a) Read the document b) The problem with the diary is a technical one - trying to fix

Pleasure to attend annual Onam celebrations of Kerala Cultural & Welfare Association. Generous applause for my attempt at speaking Malayalam
@catriona_ogilvy Have retweeted @chrisphilp4mp may be interested - his twins born at 25 weeks
@InsideCroydon @98rosjon I am talking about in the selection. Against Deputy Leader of Labour Group who had worked for him
@InsideCroydon @98rosjon No but he was supporting Sarah
@98rosjon @davidwhite020 This is getting confusing...
@TimMontgomerie Will ground operation make much difference if turnout v high as predicted?
@wexy8 You should have had a letter from Boris with accompanying leaflet. Which road do you live in?
@98rosjon Yes, when you talk to them they're open about a split between Steve Reed & his supporters & the long-standing councillors
"@LordAshcroft: @GavinBarwellMP presumably nobody else then....lol" << this is the kind of supportive tweet you want from you ex-boss...
@LordAshcroft Don't diminsh the achievement :)
@wexy8 ...will use a mixture of positive messages about themselves & criticisms of their opponents. Nothing wrong with this if latter fair
@wexy8 But most people don't 100% agree with any party so they choose the least bad option. In this context, it's inevitable politicians...
@wexy8 Assuming you live in the constituency, you will already have had one leaflet from me which was entirely positive
Labour were divided about their candidate; I'm delighted to have been unanimously chosen as the Conservative candidate for #Croydon Central
@davidwhite020 You may get your wish sooner than you expect - my selection meeting tonight #takenothingforgranted

@RossHaynes92 Third, remind us did your boss increase his allowance when running Lambeth?
@RossHaynes92 Second, whilst he was wrong to even think about it, *big* difference between that and actually doing it
@RossHaynes92 First, you need to keep up - Conservative Group announced this on Saturday
@Nickna001 Drop me an email and I'll send a fuller reply
@rattlecans No. More generally most things John Prescott says should be taken with a pinch of salt
@Nickna001 Any in particular you are concerned about?
@Nickna001 They've improved significantly in recent years - now better than national average - but some still not good enough
@insidecroydon @davidwhite020 With apols for the delay, answers to six of your eight questions are at the end of this http://t.co/1dTu2Ftk1z
@InsideCroydon @davidwhite020 Well there's this thing called Twitter and you can tweet a link to a webpage...
@davidwhite020 @InsideCroydon Yes, answers to all but 2 of them (the ones concerning officers) tomorrow am
@clivehbest @lorddeben @deanofsurrey @tom_burke_47 ...but if everyone takes that attitude it does
@clivehbest @lorddeben @deanofsurrey @tom_burke_47 The point of the analogy is one person/country not acting makes little difference...

@IsabelHardman They obviously stretch a lot further in Dover :)
@IsabelHardman He owns a high street?
@InsideCroydon Yes, as the Chancellor said it would be unacceptable while others in the public sector are only getting 1%
@davidwhite020 @InsideCroydon I can only find one unanswered question (which officers knew?)
@Privateallergy I am not paid a penny more as an MP than I was in 2010. And I don't have a second home. Other than that, you're right
@ratnaraja @bieneosa But as he has acknowledged he has done something wrong
@InsideCroydon Wrong. My understanding none of these four knew Cllr Fisher had taken the money in 2013/14
@AlanOlive1 But if, by your own admission, you don't know who knew, you need to be careful about saying lots of people did
@AlanOlive1 They do. And I have worked hard over the last few days to make sure the facts are put in the public domain
@TimMontgomerie I haven't had the best week truth be told. Would be good to catch up soon
Yesterday's vote a foretaste of what a Lab/LD coalition would be like - LDs voting for things they claimed to oppose a couple of years ago
@richmoran3000 Our pleasure - and thank you for recognising work my amazing staff do
@outproudandloud My pleasure (and you're right - her problem is her association with Miliband & Balls!)
@TimMontgomerie But you used to have a culture of developing young talent plus some big signings. What's happened to former?
@TimMontgomerie So you're basically no different from Chelsea & Man City now?
@SteveReedMP Secret? No, it would have been made public. But retrospective & as they recognised wrong which is why they withdrew
@Chris1966 ...publicised until the following September (though whatever the policy says, morally he should have made it public at the time)
@Chris1966 ..allowance. In 2013/14 one councillor decided to increase the amount they claimed. The policy did not require this to be...
@Chris1966 But we know how already. The Council agreed a new allowances scheme in 2010/11. A number of cllrs chose not to claim their full..
@AlanOlive1 Once again, you imply a number of people knew about this. Do you have *any* evidence to back this up?
@SteveReedMP ...makes it clear how it happened & c) today's Conservative Group statement which sets out who else considered doing it?
@SteveReedMP Is one necessary in light of a) Council data which shows extent limited to one person b) Council's allowance scheme which...
@SteveReedMP @AlanOlive1 ...not only was it wrong but it was inevitably going to become public knowledge
@SteveReedMP @AlanOlive1 Yes because each September Council publishes amount paid to each cllr in previous financial year...
@AlanOlive1 Mike clearly wasn't open about it & has paid price. Who else are you saying knew? If you're suggesting I did you need a lawyer
@AlanOlive1 It's not at all convenient for me
@martinangus Made it clear what he did was wrong + met with him to get right outcome. Far more effective than screaming "RESIGN!" on Twitter
@sundersays UKIP and the SNP different sides of the same coin
@martinangus Did nothing? Can't imagine anyone has done more over last few days to get right outcome
@outproudandloud Hope you enjoyed it
@Caz_Blanshard Email me details and I'll get on to Council
@RossHaynes92 I know you don't have to be very smart to work for Steve but surely you can read?
Hope this will go some way to restoring his reputation. What he did was wrong but he has also done a lot of good for our town #Croydon
BREAKING NEWS I have spoken to Cllr Mike Fisher this evening & he has decided to resign as #Croydon Conservative Group Leader #rightdecision
Striking how much more passionate the Westminster commentariat are about saving the Union than my constituents
Emotional day in the Barwell household: our eldest starts at secondary school today...
Home for 4.5 hours sleep after a truly depressing day. Waste of time as I'm so angry I won't sleep
@davidwhite020 @martinangus @tomblackuk If he had, people would have known he was getting more wouldn't they?
@martinangus @tomblackuk The answer is no
@SteveReedMP You know perfectly well I was defending the cut in the total cost. I have criticised the lack of openness. How we miss Malcolm
@stevereedmp Re your dodgy Housing Benefit figures, did you get them from the Library yourself or from @EmmaReynoldsMP?
@AndrewRendle Not sure what evidence I could provide to prove a negative?
@CllrSimonHall @SteveReedMP The scheme as a whole cut the allowances bill, which had tripled under the previous Labour Council
Statement on Cllr Mike Fisher's allowance claims http://t.co/CnKHeoW3pI #Croydon
@InsideCroydon @martinangus I'm angry because it is wrong for him to get big pay increase when staff get 1% & doubly wrong to do so secretly
@RossHaynes92 I'd get back to the day job or @insidecroydon will be chastising you for social media use in office hours...
@SteveReedMP No they didn't - they didn't know about it. Am in Chamber at the moment - will post full statement shortly
I'm very angry about this http://t.co/Tj2gAaIi04 Will publish a detailed response later #Croydon
@davidwhite020 Yes and one Conservatives were happy to support
@onthecouchagain Fair point but there is evidence that when you means test those who do need help don't claim it
@a_Londoner I should declare an interest as a father of 3 kids but parents face additional costs - right for government to recognise this
@onthecouchagain In time, may be possible to extend policy to Years 3-6 but right to start with youngest children
Children in Reception, Year 1 & Year 2 will get free school meals from this week, helping them at school & saving parents Â£400/child a year
@TonyLeeMartin Good to see you displaying your usual level of political judgement...
@JohnShort70 No, not achieved that rank yet http://t.co/6FbzDqH0lb
Leaving work with a Royal Warrant confirming my appointment as a Lords Commissioner & a jar of honey from a Whip who keeps bees #strangejob
@tomblackuk Not talking about unclaimed benefit - Steve's figures (which I think are wrong anyway) show big fall in out-of-work claims
@SteveReedMP @MarioCreatura I've asked Library to explain discrepancy but worth noting your figures show huge fall in out-of-work claimants
@CroydonWhispers Not me today - good luck!
@98rosjon @GreenKnight2010 b) even many of their own voters think I've done good work locally
@98rosjon @GreenKnight2010 Indeed. And self-defeating because a) suggests they've nothing positive to say about their candidate and...
@GreenKnight2010 @98rosjon Don't know who you're accusing of negative campaigning - launch leaflet entirely positive
@martinangus :) Would have been nice to meet you in person
Great to see the nearly-finished new @TheQuestAcademy building I helped to get the funding for #Croydon http://t.co/BUqkAa6N2s
@MattDeanSoton Floating voters!
Just canvassed my old house in Lomond Gardens on Monks Hill #Croydon
@davidwhite020 Won't get into that debate but reason Tories like him nothing to do with his politics
@davidwhite020 What is your view of him?
http://t.co/nUK079wi2d Anyone who knows @jimmurphymp knows he's a proud Scot. Those trying to silence him reveal darker side of nationalism
@davidwhite020 @iminicabdriver And even in that hypothetical scenario I wouldn't board the good ship UKIP Don't like nationalism of any kind
@SteveReedMP @MarioCreatura @Robbill123 ...using is similar to my Croydon figure. Why would Croydon increase be *19* times national figure?
@SteveReedMP @MarioCreatura @qprdave1234 @Robbill123 Look forward to it but suspect someone has made a mistake. National figure you are...
@98rosjon It's a swear word which if you pronounce it in a different way requires an 'e' at the end if that helps? :)
Some good work by @MPSCroydon http://t.co/x0ZDEN3K5q #Croydon
@SteveReedMP @Robbill123 The tech savvy @mariocreatura has added a link to the data so everyone can see the truth http://t.co/AlDQKgf48w
.@SteveReedMP Yes, I think it is complete & utter ***** http://t.co/AlDQKgf48w @Robbill123 #Croydon
@Robbill123 Do you have a link to @SteveReedMP making that claim re benefits? I find it hard to believe as it's utter rubbish
This by @lowles_nick about the appalling abuse of children and young people in #Rotherham is spot on http://t.co/Bb1n6SlVZ4
@davidwhite020 Quantity of regulation does not equate with effectiveness. We had a good system & Brown broke it up
@Cleanupourtown Here you go http://t.co/VC83OWGQUn
@Cleanupourtown Incorrect again
@maynon2013 @davidwhite020 @mummikins Yes but it doesn't contribute to a fall in the number not in education employment or training does it?
Excited to hear about @CroydonCollege plans for a secondary free school on its campus. For more information see http://t.co/UieTY2VpLm
@Cleanupourtown Incorrect - see this http://t.co/j0xyMBDrXp for example
@davidwhite020 I should add that doesn't mean I blame it all on last Government because they weren't solely to blame for 2008/9 recession
@davidwhite020 No, I agree with the independent IFS that the fall in real earnings is a "direct but delayed result of the 2008 recession"
@davidwhite020 Lol! But I thought Gordon Brown had abolished the economic cycle David?
@davidwhite020 Yes, still far too high but a significant improvement since change of government
@gdhanson If you bothered reading the link you would see the figures are comparable with those issued since 2000
@gdhanson I think we can take it from your response that you can't disprove what I said because it is in fact true
@gdhanson Rather than resorting to abuse, look through the statistical release & explain why the figure is wrong
@lukey_stanger @davidwhite020 I included a link to the statistical release. I know it's tough facing up to the facts but you must try...
@MrAWJLawrence Suspect different economists have different views on that one. There is a lower rate for young people to try to prevent it
@JerryLonsdale1 Yes but kids who were 13 are 17 now Jerry...
There are 184k fewer 16-24 year-olds not in education, employment or training than there were under Labour #Croydon https://t.co/PkTyYFBpFw

Thanks to staff at #Croydon University Hospital A&E Department for their care for one of my sons this morning

.@TheQuestAcademy @OasisAcademySP @EdenhamHS @ArchTen @ShirleyHighSch Good luck to your students today. Let me know how they get on
@Stuart_King Thank you Stuart. A much more mature response than some Labour tweeps
@ParkHillFriends @Stuart_King @MarioCreatura @CllrTony Why should Council Taxpayers subsidise their business???
@Stuart_King Glad to hear it. In which case I'd like to hear what is being done re Ashburton and John Ruskin playing fields
@davidwhite020 @ratnaraja Here is some initial evidence from the Council itself: fly tips reported July 2013 1,217; July 2014 1,946
@NuriaCorbi Correct - it would require some surveillance of the site/local residents who witnessed/examination of the rubbish
@ArfurZTowcrate @martinangus @davidwhite020 100% agree with your last point
@ParkHillFriends @MarioCreatura @CllrTony ...too much emphasis on cleaning up after people and not enough on catching and prosecuting them
@ParkHillFriends @MarioCreatura @CllrTony Very happy to do so. I said Labour right to focus on this. But policies aren't working...
@davidwhite020 @ratnaraja Where is your evidence that things have improved David? Not what Council says nor what constituents are telling me
.@ArfurZTowcrate @davidwhite020 You want a solution? Prosecute people rather than making law-abiding people pay to clean up after them
@martinangus @davidwhite020 @ArfurZTowcrate New administration has been in power for 3 months: do any of you think flytipping has reduced?
@martinangus @davidwhite020 @ArfurZTowcrate As I said in original tweet Labour right to focus on flytipping but action not matching rhetoric
@martinangus @davidwhite020 @arfurztowcrate You're wrong - I repeatedly raised behaviour of groups of travellers when we ran Council
Labour right to say flytipping a huge issue. So @CleanStreetStu what are you going to do about this? http://t.co/p6PROdbGKi #Croydon

Good canvassing session in Fieldway this evening until I literally put my foot in it (the wet cement a constituent had just finished laying)
@CroydonCyclists Really? Certainly not my view
@bieneosa So now you're implying it is racist to criticise a specific group of travellers for flytipping? Unbelievable
.@bieneosa Whereas what strikes me as odd is your view that travellers who behave like this need "outreach" & a home in #Croydon
@bieneosa I don't want these particular groups of travellers to settle in #Croydon given how they behave. Do you???
@CroydonCyclists They want more people to come to #Croydon - & to make it easier to walk, cycle, come by public transport & drive
@bieneosa I haven't attacked travellers collectively; my comments were about these specific groups whose behaviour is indefensible
Unlike Labour, we're tackling tax evasion & making sure everyone pays their fair share http://t.co/guYWdgocxK #Croydon

@KnightCrusaderx Your website makes no mention of congestion. It says New Addington's community spirit will be "torn in two by...a mosque"
@TonyLeeMartin In which case why do you cite these countries as evidence in a debate about what our policies should be?

@theboywilliams As am I
@davidwhite020 And I wouldn't support abolition as I think there is a strong case for a revising chamber
@davidwhite020 It was Labour MPs combining with Tory rebels who blocked reform
@davidwhite020 You're in a rather uncharitable mood this morning. My voting record clearly shows I support a largely elected 2nd chamber
@davidwhite020 Yes
@theboywilliams But if party strengths don't reflect result of last election it would be even less democratic?
@davidwhite020 Yes, of course.  Disappointed she has resigned though can understand she feels very strongly about this issue
@theboywilliams ...The problem is there's no way of removing people so only way of getting balance right is to add yet more
@theboywilliams ...larger proportion of peers than they should, which would make it harder for the Coalition to get its programme through...
@theboywilliams You could, but that would mean the party balance in the Lords wouldn't reflect the last GE result ie Labour would have a...
@bieneosa @TonyLeeMartin Or perhaps - given I've done it for 4 years - you could give me benefit of doubt & assume we're just a bit behind
@davidwhite020 @garyjamespowell Eh? Numbers are clearly increasing (albeit it is taking time)
@Laurentmurphy Fantastic! Whereabouts do you live?
@dionnemharrison Email me gavin.barwell.mp@parliament.uk and I'll take it up with them
@theboywilliams One of its arguments for reform was 'ratchet effect' of current arrangements that sees House of Lords continue to grow

@addingtonstmary Would love to. What dates/times of day is it open?
@bieneosa We have some lovely green spaces but none have anything like play areas QE Olympic Park has
@greencroydon Yes the disparity in investment between east and south London was one of points I was making
@paulady Council responsibility but would happily support bids to Lottery etc
@ParkHillFriends Like many #Croydon parks it's a beautiful green space but could do with investment to improve facilities
@addingtonstmary I would love to but am already committed to similar event with @MayorOfCroydon at the Town Hall
@davidwhite020 My point was would be great if south London had received a fraction of what east London got
@davidwhite020 Given Labour have only been in control for <3 months it would be grossly unfair to blame them
.@lunararcher Your last sentence was the point I was making. We have some wonderful green spaces but lack quality play areas for kids
Lovely family day out at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. If only we could have a park of this quality in #Croydon
@IanStratton 1% in each year (unless you were a Minister in which case 0%)
@davidwhite020 In terms of IPSA's proposal, I think it's very wrong when many in public sector will only get 1%
@davidwhite020 You implied MPs had been treated better than others in the public sector  & that this was a Government decision. You lied
@Tonybirte Yes but fiscal policy impacts their decisions...
@SteffiThompson ??? If your budget is fixed and you are required to pay your staff more you can't afford as many staff
@davidwhite020 Re wider point yes it's a factor but if there'd been higher pay increases more public sector workers would've lost their jobs
@davidwhite020 Re MPs a) most MPs have had 0%, 0%, 1% - those like me who are Ministers have had 0%, 0%, 0% b) it's not the Govt's decision

@mkpdavies It matters whether enough of the planet will remain habitable to support our current population
The less good news is I may have killed myself in the process...
Just beat my 19 year-old tennis practice partner for the third time in a row - and only the third time ever #formofmylife
@mkpdavies And how many human beings were trying to eke a living at those times?
@mkpdavies Yes it does but that doesn't preclude man having an influence does it? As a scientist, do you believe in the greenhouse effect?
@KristianCyc Yes there is - when you said "all children should have an equally good start" I assumed you were talking about more than cash?
@KristianCyc A noble aim but if the Government is going to ensure my kids have same start as all others why should I as a parent do anything
@a_e_wallace Have a look at France to see how successful high marginal rates of tax are...
@mkpdavies And when you call global warming "rubbish" are you saying Earth isn't warming or not caused by man (+ are you a scientist?)
@mkpdavies If we left the EU I presume you would want to retain access to the single market? If so, we'd still be paying
@mkpdavies Where to start? There are arguments against unlimited immigration but it helps us deal with the deficit
@argumentumuk Thanks for feedback. Are you a Croydon Central resident?
.@UKLabour You're quite right - there are 1.8 million more jobs & more apprenticeships since you left office
@a_e_wallace You don't think we already have decent levels of taxation? How much of your money do you want the state to take???
@mkpdavies Difficult to cut taxes given scale of deficit but have been able to make some important changes eg to personal allowance
@davidwhite020 This Government has legislated to provide some protection from that. Does not require a death tax
@KristianCyc But in any case the point here is this would be another tax on top of inheritance tax
@KristianCyc Don't know if you are a parent. If not, will be interesting to see if your view changes if you become one
@KristianCyc ...in life than we had. We currently have a compromise where the state takes a proportion of estates above a certain threshold
@KristianCyc ...all estates no matter how small you're going against the natural human instinct to try to give our children a better start..
@KristianCyc There is obviously a meritocratic argument for inheritance tax, but if you are saying you believe in 100% inheritance tax on...

@waynesmith1971 The first graph on this page tells the story very succinctly
@waynesmith1971 ...the result was that when recession came the deficit reached record levels. All the pain since has been to deal with that
@waynesmith1971 I haven't criticised him re bank bailouts; his mistakes were to borrow in good times & believe he'd abolished boom & bust...
Fascinating canvassing session in Addington today. Very little Labour support but lots of Conservatives who voted UKIP in May #Croydon
@waynesmith1971 Yes but they don't borrow so much that debt repayment takes up a big share of their spending
@professorgeoff @D_Blanchflower How we're recovering relative to other countries better comparison than historical UK recoveries
@AndyCavster But I do love the way the left uses the word "invest" when they mean "more government spending"
@AndyCavster *facepalm* It is nonsense like this that got us into this mess
@AndyCavster You're ducking hard choices. If you want more capital spend & lower structural defict you must cut revenue spend or raise taxes
@suey2y @a_e_wallace I doubt it - strength of mandate comes from level of participation & level of support
@Spetmologer So you are saying we should have cut spending much more savagely?
"@Ed_Miliband: I want more people to be more involved in politics." < as opposed to all those who want fewer people involved in politics...
@AndyCavster But if you are saying less revenue spend eg welfare, more capital to boost growth yes I agree
@AndyCavster Capital spending is higher under this Government than Darling planned
@TickyW What in your opinion are the differences particularly when it comes to debt?
@AndyCavster And I presume when you say "investment" you mean government spending?
@AndyCavster It is a compelling argument that you cannot - as you previously suggested - rely on growth to deal with the deficit
@TickyW And I hope you don't manage your own finances in the way you advocate the Government should do it
@TickyW It'll be news to those working in the public sector that austerity has stopped
@AndyCavster Go look it up or read the OBR reports
@Spetmologer In the tweet you replied to I acknowledged total debt is increasing - inevitable given deficit we inherited
@AndyCavster Most of the deficit is structural ie it is not going to be reduced by growth; only lower spending and/or higher taxes
@Eddy39 And increase in total debt inevitable given scale of deficit we inherited
@Eddy39 Brown responsible for deficit before recession, failure to regulate financial sector effectively + said he'd abolished boom & bust
@TickyW Austerity painful but unavoidable. Fastest growth of any advanced economy + huge rise in employment hardly a disaster
@TickyW And Labour are to blame for running deficit before recession + failure to regulate financial sector effectively
@TickyW True governments can't control international economic climate - so what do you make of Brown's boast he'd abolished boom & bust?
@cmichaels97 ...deficit before recession & failure to regulate banks effectively. Other than that you're quite right

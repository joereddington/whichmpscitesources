Labour rent control plan will simply cost tenants and reduce supply, as experts warned last time he announced it. Sat Apr 25 22:54:53 BST 2015
@richardcalhoun @Daily_Ref he's also forgotten how experts debunked the idea last time he announced it. Sat Apr 25 22:49:27 BST 2015
In reality rent control costs are borne by tenants. It will diminish the quality & quantity of our housing stock. #sameoldLabour Sat Apr 25 22:44:58 BST 2015

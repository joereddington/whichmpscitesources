@dylsharpe @TheSunNewspaper RedEd says it's all ok. just vested interests...you know...like his union backers and Labour MPs ?
RedEd talking vested interests must have forgotten his union backers or that it is labour MPs questioning his leadership? #sameoldlabour

Custom building Bill gets approved at second reading. Super news for aspiring homeowners and great work by @richardbaconmp
@beersey not when travelling for work
Congratulations to Winsford for getting it's #neighbourhoodplanning approved and in place. Allowing over 3,000 houses.
@beersey 3-3.5hrs each way ? Not cheap nor practical with days usually going 8-10pm or later at work.
@beersey can often be more. Eg current price at PI for Monday is £169. Levels are set by IPSA, not set by MPs
@beersey your pic confirms my point. Several nights not 1
@beersey the bills are not for 1 night. IPSA regulate and approve the levels.
@beersey ? Never spent that on a night. IPSA do these things and set rates.
@mirabarhillel @CommunitiesUK ? Thousands already do it. Seems good to work to open to more people.
Good to hear Richard Bacon highlight #housingday on November 12th
@christopherhope referenced by Richard Bacon in cost on build debate :-)

This government has seen more council houses built in 4 yrs than entire 13 yrs of Labour. Getting Britain building.
While Labour set artificial targets this government is building houses. Labour let fall to levels of 1920s, now back to 2007 levels
Labour=more borrowing & debt. We = focused on building houses & back to highest rate since 2007. Helping people onto the housing ladder.
#SameOldLabour Back to top down housing targets and no full outline of how to achieve their target. Same approach that failed for 13yrs.
Labour playing poor catch up to our already announced plans for first time buyers. #SameOldLabour

I am talking to @BBCNorfolk this morning about a range of local issues.
Labour want council tax revaluation = big council tax rises 4 #GreatYarmouth residents. Will local Labour Party support my fight to stop it?

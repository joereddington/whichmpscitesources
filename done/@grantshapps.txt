@Raadedendron happy to have a sensible debate, but throwing terms like monster around not helpful.
.@BuzzFeedUK based on a false comparison. UKIP collects membership centrally, @Conservatives locally - article ignores c£15m remains local
@PickardJE Lab also collects membership centrally, whereas we collect locally - equates to c£15m a yr in small sums, not included in our a/c
@PickardJE 1. We became debt free THIS May (not last yr). 2. We don't inc. Association assets (i.e. buildings) centrally, where Lab do.

With one year to go until the General Election, I'll be chatting to @JuliaHB1 on @LBC shortly after 3pm about securing this recovery.
@OwenJones84 yes I'm serious. Rent controls restrict supply and worsen standards.
Once rent controls were scrapped, the no. of homes available for rent DOUBLED, the quality of properties improved & satisfaction improved.
Ed Miliband determined take UK backwards. Rent controls SHRUNK the rented sector from 55% in 1939 to just 8% by the late 80s.

@roryyeomans Not that there's not an issue with rents, but that Miliband's mad cap rent cap response would fail. Just as it did previously!
@scottagnelson @wdt1967 @arobson58 regardless of who you vote for, I work hard for all my constituents, including you.
Lab Lord Glassman in Jan, "We've really got to get out of the idea that capping something is going to solve a long-term structural problem."
I'll shortly be discussing Labour's 'mad-cap rent-cap' policy on @LBC with @IainDale shortly. Listen in http://t.co/xMyTG2xHwi
Out of interest, according to the ONS, across England rents have risen by 1% which is less than inflation both CPI & RPI over the past year
Supply of Rent-able homes would dry up as landlords withdraw from the market. So LESS choice forcing vulnerable to accept poorer standards.
The DCLG Select Committee says Rent Controls "would serve only to reduce investment in the sector", leading to poorer quality accommodation!
RENT CAPPING has been tried in the UK before. It helped shrink the Private Rented Sector from 55% to 8% by the time the policy was scrapped!
TO FOLLOW: Some tweets on Labour's 'rent cap' housing policy. Why it would hurt the most vulnerable and is one of their worst ideas to date!

Congratulations to @chrisphilp4mp on his selection as prospective MP for Croydon South
@Politicalintel thanks for noticing the cat.
@nigelwonguk good question. I think they can work very effectively. Sometimes they're chaired by MPs more interested political points though

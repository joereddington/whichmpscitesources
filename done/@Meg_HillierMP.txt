@woodskildn @marthasydenham @newera4all Was never "off the ball" there needs to be greater security for long term tenants per se
@Briggflatts @marthasydenham Have been involved for over 2 years and frustrated at lack of legal rights for most private sector tenants.
@marthasydenham  I have offered support.  Further details here; http://t.co/sLYVhrE4u6
Continue to fight for the New Era Estate.  People and homes before profit.  http://t.co/sLYVhrE4u6
.@hannahfearn @WebRootsUK @Parliament_Week as T-line shorthand user I'd be sad to see the skills die. Losing an X on a ballot won't kill it
@Parliament_Week yes it can help. With open data and better access it'll be easier to understand and influence Westrminster and politics
.@WebRootsUK @Parliament_Week just as kids today laugh at black and white TV, paper and pencil will be a distant memory, speaking personally
.@Sootypus @WebRootsUK @Luke_Ashby @TiresiasGreen that's the challenge and we'd be foolish to think that Whitehall can always keep ahead
.@Kevinsatizabal and so much better than the current system which breaches your confidential vote. But again security needs to be priority.
.@StuartLong01 @Parliament_Week We all need to demand it and make sure benefits are understood outside tech sphere #digtialdemocracy
.@WebRootsUK @Luke_Ashby @TiresiasGreen @Sootypus my personal view is that it makes life a lot easier just as with on-line banking
@JamesHWalker9 which is why I believe #digitaldemocracy could help by improving contact, trust and understanding in general.
.@Parliament_Week @KESHumanities this is a key issue and a good example of how better engagement could improve policy considerably
.@Luke_Ashby @TiresiasGreen @Sootypus agree. Whole debate needs to be had about identity assurance whichever the medium #digitaldemocracy
.@WebRootsUK @Sootypus agree, need to make sure that we speak clearly about issues that matter to people. #digitaldemocracy makes easier
@Youth_Debate great - keep up the good work. #digitaldemocracy
.@MrJW18 @Parliament_Week I say open it up. Provide open data and follow the @tflofficial model, let a 1000 flowers bloom. #digitaldemocracy
.@Sootypus it would solve turnout alone. Security is key issue. Needs to be resolved but current system is not very secure #digitaldemocracy
@talkthetalkrob I agree. Most people don't want the party political focused battles but are interested in issues. We need to engage better
.@andy_williamson @Parliament_Week @FortitudeMag politicians engage on doorsteps as well. My constituents are very engaged. More to do.
.@StuartLong01 @Parliament_Week don't get me started on broadband! Need to see it as vital infrastructure and sort it out. #digitaldemocracy
@RLSBcharity @parliamentweek that could be one of the real benefits. Accessibility is another reason it's worth exploring #digitaldemocracy
.@Parliament_Week @FortitudeMag Apathy overstated. Lots of interest in issues but political parties need to engage better #digitaldeomcracy
.@WebRootsUK @Luke_Ashby @Parliament_Week fair point.To maintain security  votes in elections will be secure and separate from daily contact
@ArranHunt @BiteTheBallot on its own it won't solve engagement but should make it easier to engage and understand  #digitaldemocracy
@StuartLong01 @Parliament_Week @HouseofCommons I hope so. The #digitaldemocracy commission has looked at open data in detail.
.@Melanie_Pinet @Parliament_Week Key issue.Security must be priority if we go down this route and have on-line voting #digitaldemocracy
.@WebRootsUK @Luke_Ashby @Parliament_Week on-line voting quite a different debate to day to day engagement on key issues #digitaldemocracy
.@StuartLong01 @Parliament_Week social media can be a great network of common interest so it's a way of engaging quickly with a group
@WebRootsUK I think we should explore this. We need to be alert to security but not let these concerns stop us trying
@mtmihailescu it can be more immediate and reach people in real time. But not everyone uses social media #digitialdemocracy
.@Parliament_Week @youthdebates smart phone use is growing, now 61% of adults, so any differences will diminish over time
.@StuartLong01 @Parliament_Week Yes absolutely. That's why House of Commons Speaker set up #digitaldemocracy commission
@Parliament_Week @stuartlong Fair point. But as we open up digitally need to manage digital overload and expectations too
@BitcoinRat @digidemocracyuk I agree UK should lead. We need the best technology and sounds like you're more expert than me
@Parliament_Week @FortitudeMag No not on its own but we need to move with the times and engage the digital generation
It's Respect for Shopworkers Week. I am proud to support #Usdaw's Freedom From Fear Campaign #Respect14.  http://t.co/ygLHmwfPMf
Every #young person I meet in #Hackney #schools wants better #careers advice. Face to face, independent and work experience. Not impossible.
Challenging Government officials about #careers advice in Public Accounts Committee. Permanent sec acknowledges it's not universally good
Great to host @EastsideLondon in HOC. Celebrating 20 years of engaging local communities and raising aspirations http://t.co/0PBXYjjlwV
@andymalt And also enjoyed that no #cycle super fast cycle racers cutting me up. in #Copenhagen even the car drivers are polite and patient
@andymalt I know! It was liberating to be able to leave it with just the easy back wheel lock. Hate hunting in London for a #bike stand
Fact finding in #Denmark about cycling and health systems. Got on a bike to experience city from 2 wheels http://t.co/GLbj91z1rG

Urgent call for global action for Kobanê | ANF http://t.co/D9IcsOozYy
Hoping that news about #Chibok schoolgirls in #Nigeria is true and that these girls will be safely freed after 200+ days
@CathPrisk @andyburnhammp Ouch. Get well soon.
My thoughts with the people of Kobani - hope that support from fellow Kurds and US will mean defeat for ISIL
@LizzieReather @AsEasyAsRiding Not against them - but they don't work everywhere
@Jono_Kenyon Thanks. I chaired working group for new bus station at Finsbury Park so we could have a long exchange about the issues etc
@jonburkeUK @BBCr4today @UKLabour Exactly. Decent homes transformed homes and lives in #Hackney. Now focus needs to be on building for all
@hyper_linda It's a specific location where I don't think it will work. We need to manage space for pedestrians, bus users and cyclists.
Raised the issue of support for #Kobane with #UK Foreign Secretary and the minister this morning http://t.co/bL3Vp3E5MB
"@Rekindled212: Until 31 Oct Homage to the Windrush exhibition photos Already seen by Hackney Speaker, councillor & MP!" > it's great!
Highlighted #Hackney's approach to improving the streets for cyclist. Number of local residents cycling to work doubled between 2001 & 2011
"@rosannadownes: .@CTC_Cyclists will be live blogging the #GetBritainCycling debate. When it eventually starts... http://t.co/lZbr94RdUh…"
Busy day in House of Commons. Pressed culture minister Ed Vaizey earlier about broadband. Government complacent about failure to deliver
Just asked #UK Foreign Secretary to support a humanitarian corridor to support #Kobane. Will post full copy of his statement shortly
I am delighted by the news that @SportingHackney Football Club has been awarded a grant of £3,000 to create new teams by @FootballFoundtn

Working to promote #opendata and @digitaldemocracy  #openparl14. Citizens and politicians are empowered with access to information
Was that the best ever turnout at #Chatsworth Road festival? All funded by local businesses - please keep supporting them!
Great to see @AS_cycles at #Chatsworth Road festival. Support solly's fund for Homerton hospital. Love @AS_cycles 113,114,115,116,117

Still time: vote for @lukeakehurst and @johannabaxter for #Labour #NEC. Lost your ballot? http://t.co/HGCERMXATQ for new one. Vote by 18 Aug
@alexrussell79 that itself is a good first step - but key is to break divide between segregationalists and integrationists, both can work
@alexrussell79 agree we need a strong and united voice. And certainly not just women, was speaking up for all slow cyclists regardless
@eg_hale good point. Lots of routes like thay but we need more investment in cycling to create these types of safer routes
Just explained my slow cyclist thoughts on safer cycling inc better alternative routes and more  training on @BBCLondonNews @bbclondon949
@roseemanley @Jess_tickle agree completely. My views in #getbritaincycling @appgcycling. New figs show fewer women than men cycle.
@SophieEastaugh was talking about all slower cyclists (like me!). But there was a report that women cycle less than men. Need safer options
@ZarinaHolmes @Beckygolland @guardian isn't it great! We need a new cycling code with the increase. London not training for tour de France
@me_ste I didn't speak to them. I was arguing for alternative cycle routes for slower cyclists (like me - a happy pootling woman!).
@baldersdale @helenpidd @guardian there was an experiment on Regents canal for fast cyclists to use parallel roads rather than canal
@baldersdale @helenpidd @guardian more about alternative routes than actual double cycle lanes. #Hackney good at this. But funding big issue
"@helenpidd: In praise of pootling http://t.co/Jxefm4ziSE via @guardian" thank you and for drawing attention to what I actually said.
@baldersdale @vincentstops cycling in London shouldn't be training for Tour de France. Great to see more cyclists. Need new behaviour code
@baldersdale agree. But more women than men seek training. I found it a help. Maybe start with compulsory cycle training in schools
@VincentStops great. Nationally far more men than women cycle, fast or slow. So need more of #Hackney's approach nationally
@eg_hale thanks. Was speaking personally. Was also an attempt to do this along Regents canal with on road parallel route for fast commuters
@job_rot no problem! Strings getting long now and too difficult to engage and correct all misunderstandings to all #Tweeters. Signing off.
@job_rot I helped write the report
@JessieBeaton was attempt to do this on canal with parallel route for fast cyclists and canal for slower ones (like me, speaking personally)
@job_rot me too. Need to make sure it's a big issue at election. London cyclists have always been vocal, needs to be a national priority
@job_rot The #getbritaincycling report is at http://t.co/VNJqoV6pdt .  Have a read and send me an email if you have further concerns.
@job_rot see #getbritaincycling report where we concluded that most speed limits should be determined locally, after some debate.
@seanlondonandon agree but we must also focus on what we CAN achieve as well as what we WANT. And pressure needed to press for more money
@seanlondonandon need to start with what's possible in short term and aim high. We've had much discussion about best way to get Govt action
@job_rot one of the best supported reports from backbench MPs #getbritaincycling last year was a manifesto for future investment in cycling.
@seanlondonandon I helped write @appgcycling #getbritaincycling - manifesto for action. Fact is fewer women cycle than men we need to tackle
@Goyieeem spare me the lazy stereotyping. Safer, better facilities, better planning and design helps kids, adults and scared women like me
@ibikebrighton @liz545 @sallyhinch @citycyclists #everydaysexism not at all but need to remove barriers for all: safety, storage, designetc
@kcelmes didn't actually say that but speaking personally I go quiite slow at times and try to avoid fast anything.
@MattDParker @citycyclists absolutely. I am too scared to cycle in central London (except for Sky ride)  a glorious glimpse of  future.
@shhh @citycyclists @CarolineAIng that's what I was saying. It was the survey that identified a difference in number of cyclists by gender
@shhh @citycyclists was speaking for myself. But more men than women cycle (less true in #Hackney). Far more women than men have  training
@bikesandbabies yes. Agree not all perfect but #Hackney council ahead of many other areas. I pretty much always go back routes.
@ffub exactly. Need space for slow (like me) cyclists and the fast racers
@smsm1 have not deleted any tweets - have no idea which one you refer to. Let me know, I'll respond. Was speaking personally as cyclist
@InShoreditch please email meghilliermp@parliament.uk. Thanks
@GrahamofLondon please email with a bit more detail. Am buidling a dossier of evidence. Thanks meghilliermp@parliament.uk
@ubaid923 presumably you did not hear me on BBC yesterday.
@McSorleyMe happens all the time - most politicians are meeting the public most weeks. Surely worth a try though? Works for London Mayor
@BambooPR please email meg.hillier.mp@parliament.uk. Still time to get involved
@McSorleyMe bit rude. Works in London for Mayor (since 2000). And other precedents too.
@Asitseemstome absolutely. A big focus of #digitaldemocracy commission. Old fashioned stump events also have their place
@Asitseemstome and could experiment with live webchats/ Twitter etc.

@benunsworth good point. #Parliament is too opaque. And lots of people make money from advising how to navigate the system. #DDCEngage
@curiousc good question. With open data there's huge opportunity to involve public as part of the team. MPs must embrace public input
Asked #housing minister serious question about using housing benefit to build #homes rather than fund rents. He didn't answer. Does he care?
Congratulations to #Hackneys @BonnieFreechyld who has reached the final of the Rock the House Competition. Best of luck today!

@Hepworthclare @BCCampaign Am very sorry for your loss. And you're right to remind us that men can be victims of breast cancer too
Only two women MPs on the #Government benches in the House of Commons for Foreign office questions. Just two. One's a ministerial aide
12,000 women in the UK still die from breast cancer each year. I am supporting @BCCampaign, who today launch their #spreadtheword campaign
#Hackney week in @EveningStandard. Shoreditch Sisters @Londonwi Tues and an interview with me in magazine today.

@PoliticalYeti @ayestotheright @CliveBettsMP the goalie! He was big and fit - but @CliveBettsMP and I scored one each. Or did he let us?
@rita_krshn true!
@philiploy we need different solutions for different places. #cycling. Let's innovate!
@VincentStops there's lots to be learned from the #hackney experience nationally
@EYEearlyEd another recommendation of the Get Britain Cycling report which the @AllPartyCycling APPG published last year
@beau_bou do you design/ sell cycle clothes for women?
@beau_bou in #Hackney the council has made huge improvements for cyclists mostly without segregation. If we wait for it it'll take too long
@EYEearlyEd absolutely. All school children should learn at school - just as they learn to swim. Would mark generational shift.
@davewalker cycling cartoons (at http://t.co/dNCuxqSgZv) just got a plug at @appgcycling. Very funny. Have a look.
Mary Creagh just called for efforts to get more women cycling and reduce the higher death rate of women cyclists
@EYEearlyEd we're hearing from passionate cyclists. Challenge is make sure there's sustainable funding and planners who think bike

@economyofhours please send details to meg.hillier.mp@parliament.uk
@NiallO_Driscoll how horrible for you and neighbours. Do contact your local councillor as they may have had other complaints.
@JoelTaylorMetro have never advocated compulsory ID cards. Can prove identity other ways. I don't have a utility bill in my name. Lots don't
@marthasydenham not everyone would need or want two IDs. Some (interestingly mainly men) did. But some wanted an EU travel doc and ID only.
@IanDunt ever met someone who's not been able to vote because some one got there first? We already have postal votes with signatures.
@JoelTaylorMetro again I know many constituents with neither. Driving licences mean you have to drive or at least be learning.
@JoelTaylorMetro no. Can use many other ways but passports are slower and more cumbersome. Opened a bank account recently without one?
@B_HQ bigger question than the simple ones I was being asked! But also true that people vote for party value as much or more than individual
@IanDunt never argued for compulsory scheme. It would speed up identity assurance for those with. Those without would have more to do
@marthasydenham could do. Same difference except travel enabled passports more expensive so would be a lot more expensive for taxpayer
@EmmaTenterten and you're very agressive. I was just illustrating the difference between fraud and need. And also speak from experience.
@JoelTaylorMetro and if they were cheaper what would be the difference between them and ID cards? Every Brtish passport holder on a database
@B_HQ was asked about how you (I) are going to vote and about how you (Labour Party) is will vote. I have reservations. LP hasn't decided.
@IanDunt let's not get nasty. There were Tory and LibDem councillors in #Hackney jailed for electoral fraud. It is an issue -we can't ignore
@JoelTaylorMetro @IanDunt if you have a passport you have an ID card. If you're poor you often don't have one. Very excluding.
@marthasydenham if you have a passport you have an ID card but expensive and out of reach of many. Try opening bank account without one.
@EmmaTenterten not true, plainly Illustrative of difference between helping those who ask and corruption. Lots do ask for help. Many don't.
@CassandraCogno please send details to hillierm@parliement.uk. I respond to constituents but read all emails.
Visited work programme provider A4E yesterday. Are you or anyone you know on work support programme in #Hackney? Let me know your experience

@bendean1979 blimey. I only chaired and enquiry and wrote an article I believe in and I get all this anger. I'm not lecturing anyone.
@BrummieRose2015 and thanks for all your work for a #Labour2015 victory. We need an army of mums to fight for our kids futures
@RoslynByfield it'll take a combined effort of patients, managers and clinicians. We heard from many clinicians who were very positive
@IWasForReal agree that this is an area with huge challenges which is why we must all speak up about empowerment of patients
@bendean1979 that's a pretty sweeping view. Empowerment is something I really want to see improved. Particularly important in mental health
Many thanks to @launchpadlabs for hosting #Hackney pupils at their launch tonight. Practising what they preach to inspire and diversify

Nothing in Queen's Speech to tackle woeful internet in Shoreditch. The Government have to get a grip http://t.co/YsSqm4dFEI #betterbroadband
Gov’s attempt to reinvent the wheel with new childcare measures. Will only add complexity and confusion for parents http://t.co/YsSqm4dFEI

Thunder, lightening, hailstones in #Hackney. Is summer over?
@UKfullyfocused young people are our future - in #Hackney over a third of residents under 30. And around 5th under 16. Taxpayers of future.
Remember that if you've not posted your ballot you can drop it in to any of the local polling stations or the Town Hall.
@still_les oops! And why #Labour values worth standing up for. And locally a lot depends on who runs your council

Five things the NHS must learn about empowering patients http://t.co/sBz7nO38Gx
@BipolarBlogger that's not quite as bad but still... Many of my constituents make complaints about things being done to them not with them
@BipolarBlogger that's terrible. What happened to expert patients? Patients should know more about themselves....
@HackneyCC lots to do to convince Govt of value of FE particularly in helping people get skills for good jobs
@BipolarBlogger this must change. other countries are well ahead of UK. #simonstevens says think like a patient... We should see out records

My recent article about the future of the Co-op that was featured on @politicshome . Still more to fight for.   http://t.co/MEJp4vmiLp …
#Labour annoucement on #minimumwage welcome in #Hackney. Have had grown men in tears at surgery about how to support family on low wage
#coop passed a motion broadly supporting Myner's reforms without dissent. But promises on democratic reform must now be delivered.
@HomaANDSotto thank you. Battle for soul of #coop starts now
Just been calling for democracy to be part of #Coop reform on @BBCr4today. Without members in control it's not a coop. Simple as that
@AndreaCooperUK can only wonder how they know about the goldfish? One little goldfish flushed at 80mph. And who would do that?
@DrewTweedie well yes. But Speaker's Digital Democracy Commission hearing interesting international evidence citizens shaping law#wepc2014
@DrewTweedie seriously though MPs not generally happy with extra recess. No chance to challenge govt or lobby ministers in person
@DrewTweedie hmm disco full of very loud 5 year olds or Prime Minister's question?
What a week: #Nigerian girls, Global Health report #patientempowerment, #coop group AGM, and so much more with school disco for light relief
The talking toilet on my #Virgin train told me not to flush unwanted bills or goldfish. No, I'm not joking. Do people actually do that
@FBureaucrat I am a Coop Party MP, because I believe in cooperatives. I receive no direct personal funding from Coop Group.
See today's @guardian on #Coop future. Members must be central or it's not a Coop.  http://t.co/sqJI6S3QYk
@TechCityNews progress being made on #betterbroadband campaign. Asking Hackney businesses to get in touch with their connectivity issues
I'm pressing for businesses in Hackney to get better broadband. Any business having issues connecting, please get in touch #betterbroadband

Yesterday I challenged the Deputy Prime Minister about the roll out of superfast broadband: http://t.co/KBxr8rlKQV
Lord (Ted) Graham, 75 years of cooperator, speaking passionately of his shame and that of members and staff. Highly critical of fat cat pay
Glad that John Spellar MP raised issue of #Nigerian schoolgirls with Foreign Secretary. UK help is really important. #BringBackOurGirls
Raised concern about #Nigeria and #trafficking with minister in Parliament. Must work to reduce trafficking including for Chibok girls
@NdlovuLawrence we'll put on-line any reports we get.
@DebbieAriyo  High Commission now attending. Should be interesting - security, girls rights, abuse & trafficking. Expecting lively debate
"@DebbieAriyo: APPG Nigeria & @Meg_HillierMP organising event in parliament Tues with Nigerian High Commission & diaspora about Boko Haram."
Mr Speaker Bercow at #wepc2014 to fly the flag for @digidemocracyuk which aims to transform citizens digital engagement with Parliament
Delighted to meet Lucy Park @teampopong which set up Korean They Work for You - helping citizens hold their politicians to account
@winyr9 you might also look at history of support pioneered by the Coop.
@winyr9 yes, it shares the profits with producers and helps prevent exploitation. We all benefit is poorer countries can support themselves
#APPG #Nigeria meeting Tues on abducted school girls, trafficking and women's rights is filling up. Interest is so great, need more room
@Phillip_D_Jones please don't become too cyncical. I too have days when I wonder how/if I  make a difference. Staying silent not an option
@JamesWThurston thank you. Coop needs to be well run but it is a Coop. All - management, board and members need to step up to challenge
@Phillip_D_Jones emphatically not. Shocked that you could think so. Many people UK think Africa a country not a continent so lots to do
@Phillip_D_Jones not what I said. Most people in UK know nothing about Nigeria, the APPG seeks to change that. Don't read too much in 140 ch
@Phillip_D_Jones it's not MPs but concerned diaspora. And good for MPs and others to learn about what's happening. Nigeria a complex nation
@Phillip_D_Jones important that all concerned can express their views and that Govts explain  actions but also wider issues to discuss
Latest news #Nigerian girls is awful. Every parent's nightmare. Am hosting discussion next week in Parliament with @DebbieAriyo and others.
@harryph which is why #Labour proposals will work because it's a 3 year fix not forever. Better for tenants and landlords.
@CCHQPress @SadiqKhan this proposal by @Ed_Miliband and #Labour is good for landlords and tenants. New York completely different model.
@CCHQPress @SadiqKhan this proposal by @Ed_Miliband  is just right. Landlords and tenants will benefit. New
@FashionLondon1 impressive! Fashion creates jobs and am keen to support our #Hackney fashion designers and makers
Proud that #Hackney's #Homerton hospital is first in UK to have A&E classed as outstanding by CQC. Also praises staff relations.

@EastsideLondon good to meet you and learn how you're nurturing the creative flame in #Hackney and London's school children.
@ibrahim_Dogus please email my office with details.
@HaydarUlus please email my office and I can send detail of bookings but unlikely this can be sorted at such short notice.
@allanholloway @PLaugee no one clinging to past. Coop Group(s) have often made tough business decisions but stayed as Coops not become PLCs.
@PLaugee @allanholloway Coop Group donates to Coop Party not individual MPs. Has been a cut to that funding. Either donors or state funding
@PLaugee exactly. We must  maintain the options on the high street and preserve the Coop principle
In #PAC (public accounts committee. Dept for Transport acknowledges there are lessons to learn about getting business to help fund transport

@kristy_hodges I remember the heritage centre opening. Glad it's still going more than 20 years later.
@lukeakehurst something tells me you'll be at a few more Labour Party meetings - even if not in #Hackney. But we'll miss you.

Great to meet @unifrogtweets to discuss careers advice for #Hackney young people. Enthusiastic support for our borough's children's futures.
Looking forward to supporting #Hackney's Bridge Academy tonight. Always a warm and well mannered welcome from pupils

@Audere2010 that's your choice but I think you have misunderstood. I don't want water cannon on London's streets. Perhaps you do.
Am hearing arguments for and against water cannon in riot situations in London. Have many reservations but let me know your views.

@LauraChildcare a wise woman onze told me "sometimes Mum's can cope to much". A little more chaos and they become self reliant is the theory
@LauraChildcare bit younger than yours plus an U5 -  even she packs her own bag etc. Neglect by Mum = independence. Or so I tell myself....
@LauraChildcare wonderful! My kids are great too but I'm always mildly surprised and very delighted when they show maturity. #greatkids
@garyfoskett a temporary move may be necessary. Westminster would bé a great museum/ tourist attraction.

@BrianUkulele agree universal credit badly managed. Public Accounts Committee on this case too
@domtheseal worth looking up legal challenges on this issue. First were probably 20 years ago but I've not followed in detail
@Domtheseal depends on planning agreement. Paying council tax does not equal right to parking and many tenants not allowed on street parking
Faces of ex BBC execs behind former IT top man are stony as #PAC investigates #BBC digital media initiative
@Domtheseal on face of it it's challenging. From memory there were unsuccessful legal challenges in early car free developments in Camden.
@Domtheseal please do but you may be better writing to your councillor or elected Mayor Jules Pipe. Planning and parking council matters
@MyBigCareer #Hackney 6th formers inspirational. University admissions tutors should meet them.

@jasonmfalconer but with big budget cuts coming can't be sure it will continue. Need to see cycle training as equivalent to driving lessons.
@jasonmfalconer getting teenagers trained would be good but also need adults getting back on a bike to learn.

@GAlexanderUKYP true. Party politics can be boring and focused on structures. We need to engage better with what young people care about.
@GAlexanderUKYP I'd like to see votes at 16 but am amazed at how many 16 and 17 year olds are reluctant.

@LaurenCaraP @AdrianTippetts @finsbury_pk which is one of the problems. Cost of daily bike parking puts people off so costs more to run
@ramsov go to A and S bike stall. Lovely people and the bike is fab. @chatsworthroadfestival on til 9pm bit bike raffle finishes about 5pm
Come on down to @chatsworthroadfestival to win bike and see all the best of business and entertainment and food. On til 10pm.
Great generosity from @as_cycles which is giving away free raffle tickets for a fantastic Bobbin bike in beautiful purple. I have ticket 12
Well done to @progress for the excellent #WforW conference today. We need to listen to the common sense and deliver for voters on #childcare
@tashahester regisering lobbyists bit pointless. We know who they are. It's the people the PM goes horse riding with we need to know about
@tashahester see my website. I have always been opposed even before bill was laid. Amazed how many write to me assuming I'm in favour!
@MrPaulStott Tories/LibDems that wasted it by cancelling. Just wait - they'll reintroduce fingerprints in passports and have to start again
@stuartdhughes didn't see it but glad to know I'm not the only old fashioned newpaper lover left. Should be interesting on Monday... #PAC
"@stephenkb: Hugely impressed by @Sarah_Hayward , @Cath_McDonald, @Meg_HillierMP on care. #wwithw" >thank you Stephen.
@E9_Resident thanks for email. Twitterati: 38 degrees has not arranged a meeting with me on 9 Sept. Am busy with constituents all morning.
@E9_Resident first I've heard of it. Perhaps you could email me details although I am already committed all day.
At launch of new research into apps in EU. 22 per cent of the global production of app related products comes from the EU
@MalariaNoMore look out for UK's National Audit Office report on malaria intervention examined in Parliament yesterday. PAC report to follow
I'm backing Chris Evans MP's #manifestoforaction on #highcostcredit. Are you? Poorest borrowers need protection. Please RT
Big turnout to question Ian Duncan Smith on National Audit Office report on failures of universal credit. Unfortunately I was not called.
Are you a #shoreditch or #hackney businees that's been crowdfunded. Tell me how important it was for you. Need to help FCA to right decision
Challenged minister over lamentable broadband speeds, connection and costs in #hackney. He offered to meet. Please email me your experience
@TheCriminalBar let's hope Edward Garnier also has influence. He told us had at least 2 meetings with Lord Chancellor.
@davidLammy now making comparison with other privatised services: school food led to turkey twizzlers, hospital cleaning to MRSA #legalaid
Even Edward Garnier QC MP and Govt loyalist critical of #legalaid changes. @davidlammy now standing up for fairness and quality
Busy day ahead with meetings on mental health support, #PMQs, Nigeria and efficiency of DfID spending on malaria.
Good turnout of MPs at debate on #legalaid. Cross party concerns about lack of choice, attack on quality  and cartels of large providers
@david_joffe TfL say they are aware of issues at Highbury and Islington and are looking at long term solutions. Will keep onto them
About to vote against the draconian lobbying bill. Govt intent on rushing it through by 9 October
Meeting with TfL to discuss reduced bus services in Hackney, congestion at Highbury and Islington and cycling. Lots of promises on cycling.
@RFalcon_ we'll try but Govt in an unseemly rush. The Lib Dems and Tories have the numbers to push this through.
@AdrianTippetts i made sure there was a secure cycle park at Finsbury Park 10 years ago. Still only a handful in UK, cos they need subsidy
@Jono_Kenyon agree. Cycling training sustained across generations could contribute to a step change.
@Jono_Kenyon agree we need vision for future - in #Brisbane great walkway and cycle route along river. Hackney safer than much of London
@ElectricAdam Hackney Council require all its HGV drivers to have cycle training. We considered making all car drivers cycle....
@SukkyCH need to clean up vehicles. Pure segregation expensive and can be difficult. Horses for courses. Not one size fits all.
@AdrianTippetts agree. Even when installed in new developments it's often inadequate, as for stations... And too often bike racks are full.
@HackneyAbbott indeed. #Hackney - cylcing capital of UK. Good planning, strong political well and not all about segregation...
Pleased to be at launch of new charity My Big Career based at #Hackney's Cardinal Pole school. Face to face careers advice needed for all.
Cycling debate @allpartycycling well attended. Glad to be able to be there for beginning with @HackneyAbbott. Make cycling safer!
@andyslarge have been a long time sceptic. Main concern is not charities or big companies but who goes horse riding with who on Boxing Day.
Fascination hearing on use of premium rate telephone lines by Government departments at Public Accounts Committee. Stop the telephone tax.
@Angelamlarge absolutely. Just congratulated him on slowing Govt rush to arms. Even with evidence have severe concerns about military action
@Daffodildreamin 'fraid not. Best to ask your local councillor if you're a resident.
@luke_a_t_barlow yes I will. Let me know your thoughts.
Great to support new ceramics hub Turning Earth and its crowd fund supporters underneath the arches in Haggerston. Opens for public in Nov
@Daffodildreamin have big local event that clashes but am vice chair of Parliamentary cycling group so often speak for cycling in Commons
@KatRichsays Shocking. Please send an email to hillierm@parliament.uk with your details. There's CCTV covering this area too.

@reobravo apologies. 9 September but do contact office meantime with details so I can get on with it. Hillierm@parliament.uk
@deedeelea not what I said at all - but for constituents to get a full response & updates I need name and address.140 characters not enough!

Need answers from Environment Agency about River Lea. Lots of promise re clean up for #Olympics. Legacy must include clean waterways

Interesting time in #Nigeria looking a human rights in Delta and more widley. Lots to do in UK and Nigeria on many issues inc trafficking
Lots of MPs waiting to speak on EU referendum bill. Speeches too long for every MP to get in. Don't like time limits but there are benefits
@PhilipGlanville @jonathanmcshane et al > thanks for your support folks.
PM and James Wharton MP strolled into Parliament by back door earlier.  PM needs to lead on Europe for nation, not follow his Eurosceptics.
Political event if the week in Cttee Rm 6 with queues  in and out as MP  vote for chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on trafficking
Great to see #Hackney pioneer - first bike cafe in Britain - Lock7 featured in The Observer.

Now examining interception of smuggled tobacco with HMRC and UK Border Force in Public Accounts Committee
Michael Gove admitted he "always listens to the Treasury" including on future of teaching assistants. Not exactly robust support then
@Geoffrey_M_B  frustrated too. Debate was longer than I thought, clashed with s/thing - will read Hansard. Will speak on legal aid next week
Ridiculously excited about the Whirling Dervishes performing in the Anatolian Cultural Festival. Catch them in Clissold Park til Sunday
But the good news is that minister confirmed childcare ratios are not being pursued by Govt. Bad news is that it's still Tory party policy
Just spoke about childcare in Children and Families Bill. Minister answered for 2mins and then almost ran out of the Chamber. Shame
@E9_Resident and it's thanks to the outcry from parents and carers that we were able to get this dropped. Now focusing on wrap around care
Business select committee looking at pub companies code today in #Parliament.
Tune in to @bbcr5 to hear teaching assistants in action at local primary Berger in #Homerton and local head Karen Coulthard

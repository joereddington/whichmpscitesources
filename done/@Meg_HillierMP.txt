.@thatdavidmiller @digidemocracyuk exactly. Re #security issues Commission was not expert but we wanted to set direction of travel Tue Mar 10 11:53:17 GMT 2015

.@dmontfort @digidemocracyuk maybe not for Intelligence and Security committee but everything else should be #opendata and open access Tue Mar 10 11:48:19 GMT 2015
.@ntoll @UKParliament .needs to be seen as business as normal. Needs political leadership and strong public pressure too Tue Mar 10 11:47:15 GMT 2015

#broadband needs to be a utility if we are to tackle #digital divide and make #digitaldemocracy inclusive Tue Mar 10 11:45:19 GMT 2015
.@dmontfort @digidemocracyuk agree. But we are committed to #opendata by end of this year Tue Mar 10 11:44:06 GMT 2015
.@ntoll @UKParliament  Cabinet Office is pushing this. But data dumping too often norm as much data collected in inaccessible formats Tue Mar 10 11:43:23 GMT 2015

.@JennyP_Carnegie key is to get MPs and other elected people to see digital as like a digital doorstep conversation. Random chats useful too Tue Mar 10 11:39:19 GMT 2015
.@thatdavidmiller yes but not to hand right now. I'll try and upload later or put on website. Tue Mar 10 11:37:34 GMT 2015
.@ntoll @NHSEngland exactly. #Opendata is not about dumping data so we need to make sure @UKParliament and importantly #Government get this Tue Mar 10 11:36:22 GMT 2015
.@ntoll yes..that's the plan. New head of Parliament Digital Service @Rob_Greig is already working on this Tue Mar 10 11:33:54 GMT 2015
.@SDale60 @HouseofCommons agree. That's why we want people to be able to be more informed - a major plank of our report #digitaldemocracy Tue Mar 10 11:32:39 GMT 2015

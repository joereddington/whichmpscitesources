Nail on the head: the #SNP is now a mystic, Gnostic, Bolivarian sect cult. http://t.co/fC3c5jzlXX #GE2015 Tue Apr 28 15:05:50 BST 2015
Cybernats up in arms over Miliband's 'no more indyref'. Daily Record's @davieclegg broke that story weeks ago. Why did nobody listen to him? Tue Apr 28 14:58:26 BST 2015
Ed Miliband has helpfully confirmed there will never be another #indyref under Labour, meaning Gordon Brown can get a day off tomorrow. Tue Apr 28 14:51:22 BST 2015
@WingsScotland Once again you poison the internet with your words and no evidence or facts to support those words whatsoever. Vile. Tue Apr 28 14:17:41 BST 2015

Obvious nationalist @KayeAdams let Sturgeon off the hook today. Unprofessional. #GE2015 Tue Apr 28 10:11:18 BST 2015
The #SNP are nowhere near a majority in the polls,so cybernats resort to physically abusing patriotic female radio stars. They have nothing. Tue Apr 28 10:07:20 BST 2015

Well done @KayeAdams,one of the best interviews ever conducted. Sturgeon couldn't answer a thing. Adams may be a nationalist but she's fair. Tue Apr 28 09:22:11 BST 2015

Nate Silver has predicted the Tories will win the most seats. But it must be stressed that Nate Silver is foreign, and a separatist. #GE2015 Tue Apr 28 07:34:37 BST 2015
Kezia Dugdale is correct, climate change is at the heart of everything Labour does. That is obvious - it should not really need spelled out. Mon Apr 27 23:16:54 BST 2015
Nationalist rag the @Daily_Record basically manufacturing poll numbers to suit their agenda. Sickening. http://t.co/5WTW2gSWeF #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 22:51:46 BST 2015

Fatal blow for Sturgeon as she is forced to admit to Evan Davis that she will be voting #SNP at the election. Divisive. #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 19:31:51 BST 2015
Loved seeing the Scottish Labour political broadcast, narrated by the soft, friendly tones of our next First Minister Jim Murphy. Patriotic. Mon Apr 27 19:29:44 BST 2015
Oh come on, they're not THAT bad. Simply absurd. http://t.co/fGjZcpqBYR #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 19:15:07 BST 2015
Scotland can't afford 5 more years of the Tories. We can't go back to September 18 so the only option to choose change is to choose Labour. Mon Apr 27 17:24:10 BST 2015
A vile cybernat approached me earlier and said she had a joke. 'Jim Murphy is doing a great job,' she laughed, then ran off. I don't get it. Mon Apr 27 16:02:13 BST 2015

Yesterday I bathed at my private outdoor pool. Today I have had to sip mulled wine by the fire. What is Sturgeon doing about climate change? Mon Apr 27 15:13:27 BST 2015
The last week of election campaigning can be nasty, but we're not crossing the line in saying a vote for the #SNP is a vote for leprosy. Mon Apr 27 14:21:51 BST 2015
Make no mistake - the #SNP are the bad guys. Vile. Dangerous. Sinister. Black holes. Basket case. North Korea. Busted flush. Catastrophe. Mon Apr 27 14:14:06 BST 2015
How dare the #SNP demand they lead the UK. They're only Scottish, not British. And not even patriotically Scottish. #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 13:16:30 BST 2015
Political parties should strive to lead the UK, not facilitate the break-up of the UK. #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 13:16:14 BST 2015
So the #SNP are set to take 57 seats. Just take them, like thieves. Who gave them permission? Greedy.
#ge2015 Mon Apr 27 12:09:00 BST 2015
Final blow for Sturgeon as new TNS Scottish poll sees #SNP on only 54% out of 100%. They say they're dominating - the polls say different. Mon Apr 27 11:07:57 BST 2015
I'm sometimes accused of not getting my hands dirty. Not today. Campaigning duties later include rummaging through the bins of #SNP members. Mon Apr 27 10:16:46 BST 2015
The breaking news today that the #SNP are for independence is alarming, frankly. Mon Apr 27 09:52:48 BST 2015
Extreme hatred for the Tories is what spurs the #SNP on. Labour are for working families - we don't do tribal hatred. #GE2015 Mon Apr 27 08:28:07 BST 2015

Not to mention patriotic Scots would not have been able to even watch the #LondonMarathon on the BBC. Salmond and Sturgeon are the worst. Sun Apr 26 12:50:36 BST 2015

Tonight Salmond failed to show for his job interview. Only a vote for Labour can lock out the SNP-Tory alliance. Better Together. #bbcdebate Thu Apr 16 22:10:10 BST 2015
Fatal blow for Sturgeon and the SNP as Salmond confirms he's full of hot air. She must sack him today. Embarrassing. http://t.co/BGVWku6BFh Thu Apr 16 15:19:41 BST 2015
Alex Salmond could be making decisions about the UK budget in a few weeks. It's quite simple, frankly - we must stop him. Thu Apr 16 14:18:05 BST 2015
Of course Jim Murphy couldn't make decisions about the UK budget. He's not the UK Labour leader. It's quite simple, frankly. Thu Apr 16 14:17:55 BST 2015

FM radio is to be switched off in Norway. Cybernationalist separatists like @LesleyRiddoch & @patrickharvie wanted us to be like them. Sick. Thu Apr 16 09:15:41 BST 2015
The former head of NHS England says there is a huge financial black hole. What is England's self-proclaimed saviour Sturgeon doing about it? Thu Apr 16 09:07:25 BST 2015
The press say that Sturgeon will lead a gang of bullies against Ed Miliband in the debate. Poor Ed. She should show same respect we show her Thu Apr 16 08:46:10 BST 2015
Another debate tonight - and yet again Salmond sends Sturgeon in his place. If he wants to hold the balance of power he can't hide. Stop it. Thu Apr 16 08:40:12 BST 2015

Strength. Security. Control. Currency. Pool and share. Vote no borders. Better together. http://t.co/hn2V50hG51 Mon Apr 13 11:04:43 BST 2015
New TNS poll on Scotland shows support for the SNP going up again. Remember,TNS stands for The Nationalist Scots. Not to be trusted,frankly. Mon Apr 13 10:05:52 BST 2015
Piers Morgan is trending. Piers is a British institution,whose success Scots wouldn't be allowed to share if Salmond's Sturgeon had her way. Mon Apr 13 09:44:46 BST 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as Salmond forces her to launch the SNP's business manifesto. He's too busy promoting his book, frankly. Mon Apr 13 09:23:34 BST 2015

Fresh blow for bully Sturgeon as Hilary Clinton prepares to launch Presidential bid. Sun Apr 12 16:02:15 BST 2015

Patronising, slimy, condescending, evasive, disrespectful and rude. Is Nicola Sturgeon suitable to represent Scotland as First Minister? Sun Apr 12 13:02:37 BST 2015

The Lib Dems are silly to go on about Salmond, Sturgeon and the SNP in every paragraph of every election flyer they send to homes. Insanity. Sat Apr 11 17:41:56 BST 2015
I'm standing down so don't bother going out to campaign, but the SLab team sends me pictures of the superb responses. http://t.co/jsEpcl8guc Sat Apr 11 17:19:11 BST 2015
The SNP have a child-like view of the world - and a child-like view of personal recreation. Salmond must sack her. http://t.co/fz1aOyHVXf Sat Apr 11 11:11:02 BST 2015
It's the Grand National today. If separatist cybernats got their wish last year, patriotic Scots would have been banned from wagering. Vile. Sat Apr 11 10:08:16 BST 2015
Andy Murray's getting married today. He should count himself lucky. His reckless Yes vote would have led to the end of weddings in Scotland. Sat Apr 11 09:54:00 BST 2015
Andy Murray is getting married. Marriage = strength, security, & the pooling/sharing of resources. Another example of being better together. Sat Apr 11 09:50:42 BST 2015
It's clear now that a vote for the SNP means a vote for the Tories. A vote for Labour means jobs. Pensions. Security. Pooling and sharing. Fri Apr 10 21:49:58 BST 2015
Great response for the BBC's SNP-bashing coverage tonight. Where would patriotic Scots be without the BBC? In a black hole, frankly. Fri Apr 10 21:36:09 BST 2015

Jim Murphy's right - the SNP act like Tories. Who would want to be like them? Campaign with them? Make sure they have control over Scotland? Fri Apr 10 19:13:19 BST 2015

Can't fathom why Salmond keeps putting Sturgeon up to these debates. Sarwar, Moore, Carmichael, Lamont, Murphy & now Coburn all trounce her. Wed Apr 08 22:27:10 BST 2015
Not sure who David Coburn is but heard a great response in the BBC debate. He's right, Scotland would be finished if Yes. He must be Labour. Wed Apr 08 22:16:18 BST 2015
Not surprising who Sturgeon gets it from. Clearly difficult for these people to act in a grown-up matter. http://t.co/ZgiiNpXIJV Wed Apr 08 12:53:10 BST 2015
Is this really how patriotic Scots want their First Minister to act? http://t.co/kYD4vkWlFO Wed Apr 08 12:45:05 BST 2015

Where's the delete button Mon Apr 06 16:18:38 BST 2015
The SNP not being straight. If Scotland votes SNP, Sturgeon will get her wish of another Tory gov't. Voting Labour never leads to Tory rule. Mon Apr 06 14:49:55 BST 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as cybernationalist separatist splittists forced to delete the vile "parody" account @TogetherDarling. Stamped out. Sun Apr 05 13:35:10 BST 2015

Sturgeon has said Trident is a red line. It's not a red line. It's a collection of submarines. She's buckling under the pressure, frankly. Sat Apr 04 12:43:22 BST 2015
It just gets worse for Sturgeon. Salmond has sent her to a Scrap Trident mob. If we scrap Trident the North Koreans will attack. It's a fact Sat Apr 04 12:34:30 BST 2015
We've just been told from a reliable fourth-hand source that the Sturgeon/Tory deal memo was in fact written by the Daily Record. Huge. Sat Apr 04 12:16:07 BST 2015
Why would anyone in their right mind want the Tories to be in charge of things for generations to come? We're better together. Sat Apr 04 12:08:30 BST 2015
Sturgeon admits 100% she wants the Tories in power. At least when Labour campaigned for continuing Tory rule last year we tried to hide it. Sat Apr 04 11:38:22 BST 2015

Immediately sceptical of this - joint leadership pledges never work. It's unheard of. http://t.co/9tzNpxMx2o Sun Feb 15 00:18:27 GMT 2015
Enjoying a bottle of Giuseppe Quintarelli Amarone della Valpolicella Classico Riserva. Really hitting into our expenses, though. Sat Feb 14 18:14:39 GMT 2015
Great response on the ground for Scottish Labour today, and every day. Right on track. One Nation. http://t.co/msdOLR038H Sat Feb 14 16:48:45 GMT 2015
Great response on the streets of Scotland today for Scottish Labour. http://t.co/Z09SdTUuBn Sat Feb 14 13:09:12 GMT 2015
Happy Valentines Day to proud, patriotic No voters everywhere. Spending the day dining and shopping with Maggie. And @Alan_Cochrane. Sat Feb 14 12:16:14 GMT 2015
Cybernationalist separatists bullying us once again. Sturgeon could stop this now. She chooses not to. Vile, frankly. http://t.co/MMfcCebeaG Fri Feb 13 16:02:57 GMT 2015
Look - the SNP needs to get a grip on the A&E crisis, that we notified the media about via some press releases. Thu Feb 12 15:58:27 GMT 2015
Sturgeon's speech was so nonsensical it has even confused her official biographer, @davidtorrance. There's no way back from this, frankly. Wed Feb 11 15:25:09 GMT 2015
Nationalists BBC providing wall-to-wall live coverage of Sturgeon's empty, nonsense speech. Where's our right of reply? Why no Gordon Brown? Wed Feb 11 14:51:24 GMT 2015
Sturgeon down south threatening this & that. You'd never see, say, Ed Miliband go to Scotland and make threats over currency & border posts. Wed Feb 11 14:47:13 GMT 2015
Watching #pmqs from my third home. It is the last one before yet another break so didn't believe it was worth going to. Ed on track for win. Wed Feb 11 12:01:56 GMT 2015
FACT: Open debate is anathema to SNP; it's the lifeblood of Labour. Wed Feb 11 10:32:21 GMT 2015
These figures say Scotland's motorways are safest in the UK. Mainly because we're still allowed to drive on the left. http://t.co/z27MF5AYeC Wed Feb 11 09:54:00 GMT 2015
As a strong part of the UK, patriotic Scots can share in the success of driverless cars, which hit the roads today. http://t.co/7EQJZsnTrA Wed Feb 11 08:57:31 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as Labour launches pink-coloured campaign bus in order to appeal to female cereal eaters. Well received online so far. Wed Feb 11 08:45:53 GMT 2015
Austerity is not working, Sturgeon tells London. No, that's not how it works. London tells Sturgeon how it is. Wed Feb 11 08:32:41 GMT 2015
@Independent But what currency would they use? Wed Feb 11 08:14:48 GMT 2015
Tomorrow is Inventors Day in the US. Remember, famous Scottish inventors did all their best work elsewhere. Scotland was right not to split. Tue Feb 10 22:31:57 GMT 2015
Our NHS A&E crisis continues under the SNP. Only a No vote can save the NHS. No Thanks. Better Together. UK OK. Jobs. Pensions. NHS. Tue Feb 10 22:00:43 GMT 2015
Australia is to compete at this year's Eurovision. Scotland will not. Why is Sturgeon not speaking up about this? http://t.co/12TfsdFmHy Tue Feb 10 21:51:49 GMT 2015
Nationalist rag the Guardian at it again. @Libby_Brooks is right - the SNP getting into power again is unthinkable. http://t.co/Tm6Awxhx4H Tue Feb 10 17:33:44 GMT 2015
FACT: Scotland would be bankrupt if it had voted for separation. Tue Feb 10 15:55:38 GMT 2015
Nats just can't stop picking on @jimmurphymp over a measly £1.30 on juice. I put champagne on expenses all the time & nobody moans about it. Tue Feb 10 14:52:25 GMT 2015
Nationalist rag The Guardian yet again misleading over poll results - Labour is on course to take all possible seats. http://t.co/FgHMAOqu6p Tue Feb 10 14:36:49 GMT 2015
TNS poll confirms collapse of the Lib Dems in Scotland. A massive blow for Sturgeon and the SNP. http://t.co/udCNVOHLIF Tue Feb 10 11:07:54 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as Kenny Selbie selected to replace Gordon Brown as Labour's candidate in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Massive intervention. Mon Feb 09 19:57:31 GMT 2015
It is absolutely clear Scottish Labour does everything in its power to keep suppliers in business and people in jobs. http://t.co/3gComolHhR Mon Feb 09 17:49:40 GMT 2015
Congratulations to the Daily Record for being the only Scottish paper nominated at the Press Awards. Well done David Clegg. Well deserved. Mon Feb 09 17:45:41 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as Iraq had 2nd highest oil output growth in 2014, after the USA. Questions must be answered. Mon Feb 09 14:56:03 GMT 2015
Enthusiastic response for @scottishlabour on the doors this afternoon http://t.co/GeN7OdzjOw Mon Feb 09 14:50:10 GMT 2015
One never sees @NicolaSturgeon with a can of Irn-Bru. Is she a proud, patriotic Scot or not? I suspect not, frankly. Mon Feb 09 14:19:09 GMT 2015
As a strong part of the UK proud, patriotic Scots have the opportunity to enjoy refreshing cans of Irn-Bru for nothing. Best of both worlds. Mon Feb 09 14:15:40 GMT 2015
More Labour-bashing by nationalist rag the Guardian. It is simply not fair. Where's our right of reply? http://t.co/bFfSqAgfsq Mon Feb 09 09:04:17 GMT 2015
Labour has a plan for Devo-Max in Scotland's big cities. The SNP have never had a plan that can compare in ambition. http://t.co/FnAuTY4TBV Mon Feb 09 07:45:03 GMT 2015

Radical Separation group organise their conference months after losing the referendum. Embarrassment for Sturgeon. http://t.co/Fccwv4Lq0z Sat Feb 07 20:25:28 GMT 2015
Boost from Murphy - not only will kids be protected by our nuclear weapons, we'll also have more teaching assistants. http://t.co/YjdUH76Zqf Sat Feb 07 19:23:00 GMT 2015
Fantastic try for Scotland, thanks to the money and support put into the sport from the UK government. The best of both worlds. Sat Feb 07 17:43:58 GMT 2015
Scotland trailing to France in the Six Nations. If Sturgeon put some more money into sport we wouldn't be in this mess. Severe blow. Sat Feb 07 17:40:30 GMT 2015
Skye SNP team out in Portree today. Needn't have bothered. http://t.co/EtFOtBrp0y Sat Feb 07 16:00:00 GMT 2015
Terrible group out campaigning today for #TeamCalum in Hawick http://t.co/zjaROOeqI7 Sat Feb 07 15:59:08 GMT 2015
Disappointing morning introducing @DeidreBrock @theSNP candidate for Edinburgh North & Keith http://t.co/uVxNIfdPR8” Sat Feb 07 15:58:26 GMT 2015
Hardly anyone out in Stewarton leafleting for #GE2015 http://t.co/LiJ8OJ2r0i Sat Feb 07 15:57:51 GMT 2015
Terrible turnout of campaigners at Leith Walk at launch of SNP campaign http://t.co/7nKYokhufu Sat Feb 07 15:56:58 GMT 2015
The SNP have proven they just aren't very good. Proud Scots must vote for the likes of the Tories & Lib Dems instead. http://t.co/GDEWNVKKGN Sat Feb 07 15:45:09 GMT 2015
Great responses across Scotland today for Scottish Labour. We're getting our one message across - the SNP are just not that good. Sat Feb 07 13:59:24 GMT 2015
One of the worst interviews I've ever read. Good for proud Scots that dictator Salmond is no longer in charge. https://t.co/qJKfumI0Mv Fri Feb 06 14:30:31 GMT 2015
Explaining how governments are formed in the House of Commons is simply pro-Nat bias. Getting annoyed now. Thu Feb 05 08:49:24 GMT 2015
FACT: The biggest party gets to form the next government. #VoteSNPgetTories Wed Feb 04 18:10:02 GMT 2015
@nickeardley No. Wed Feb 04 16:28:16 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon, as poll shows a nation on the verge of abandoning a major political party, making her reign look more & more dictatorial. Wed Feb 04 16:21:12 GMT 2015
'People really like the SNP.' This is obscene, desperate stuff from the nationalist press. http://t.co/Fuf86rj33y Wed Feb 04 16:05:24 GMT 2015
Lord Ashcroft is a Tory. Wish the nationalist media would stop treating his "analysis" as gospel. Scottish Labour is on the right track. Wed Feb 04 14:20:26 GMT 2015
Great news for Scottish Labour in Glasgow North East. http://t.co/n0tU93I7YR Wed Feb 04 10:39:47 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as Ashcroft polls are leaked. She must stop leading this cybernationalist menace now. Wed Feb 04 10:19:26 GMT 2015
Cybernationalist separatists just cannot stop trashing my online image. Sturgeon must stop this menace now. http://t.co/gJVQS1evfy Tue Feb 03 15:47:42 GMT 2015
Aberdeen has been voted most dismal place in Scotland. Put it down to all that uncertainty over oil. You can't base a future on it, frankly. Tue Feb 03 14:08:45 GMT 2015
Great to see social media users get on Scottish Labour's side with humorous vow tweets. The momentum is with Ed and Jim. #vowmovietitles Tue Feb 03 00:12:45 GMT 2015
Great documentary about the first ever female rabbi on BBC4. Died in a concentration camp. With the SNP's enthusiastic support. Never forget Mon Feb 02 22:26:52 GMT 2015
Please congratulate @henderson_ricky who will be replacing me as MP for Edinburgh SW. I've done my bit - it's time to let others emulate me. Mon Feb 02 21:57:23 GMT 2015
Blow for Sturgeon as her personal newspaper backs Gordon & Jim's New Vow Plus. Great news, great paper. http://t.co/KESTeZmIYQ @ScotNational Mon Feb 02 21:45:20 GMT 2015
There is 1 hour, 39 minutes and 30 seconds until #DeadlineDay is over. Certainty. Mon Feb 02 21:20:25 GMT 2015
The transfer #DeadlineDay closes at 11pm, but midnight in Scotland - thanks to the tireless work carried out today by @JimMurphyMP. #snpout Mon Feb 02 20:57:31 GMT 2015
Hearing about a possible Gordon Brown intervention tomorrow. Speech codeword currently "SuperVow". Should be good. Mon Feb 02 19:59:37 GMT 2015
It's Transfer Deadline Day. If Sturgeon got her way, proud Scot Jim White would have been removed from his job. Jobs. #DeadlineDay Mon Feb 02 19:45:24 GMT 2015
It's worth remembering the Patriots destroyed the Nationalists 55-45 in the first round. #SuperBowl Sun Feb 01 23:43:31 GMT 2015
We are backing the Patriots. Because we're patriots. We're very patriotic. Especially Jim. Football & patriotism - top night for Jim Murphy. Sun Feb 01 22:51:09 GMT 2015
#SuperBowl slumber party at @Alan_Cochrane's with the likes of myself, Jim, Kezia and Margaret. Jim likes all kinds of football. Sun Feb 01 22:48:19 GMT 2015
As a strong part of the UK, we share in the success of the most kills anywhere in the world. We're better together. http://t.co/1E7cCK45dB Sun Feb 01 22:31:23 GMT 2015
In football Scotland has always been independent. This is the consequence. Bankruptcy and hatred. Sun Feb 01 21:08:57 GMT 2015
The #SuperBowl is tonight. Ever since America chose separation, their "global" sporting events became insular, self-serving occasions. Poor. Sun Feb 01 20:25:46 GMT 2015
Look - Ed Miliband is a leader of superhuman strength. Anything otherwise is, frankly, an agenda by the newspapers. It's not fair. Sun Feb 01 19:28:12 GMT 2015
Rangers vs Celtic today. Remember, if Salmond/Sturgeon had their way both clubs would have jumped ship & moved their HQ to London. Thankful. Sun Feb 01 11:20:11 GMT 2015
Having been liberated from supporting Andy Murray by his eve of referendum tweet, enjoying not caring if he wins or loses, frankly. Sun Feb 01 10:39:27 GMT 2015

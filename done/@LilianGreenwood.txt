DWP Minister, Mark Harper, says he'll look into my constituent's case - shame he hasn't replied to the 2 letters he's already had on this!
@rb66rob Hi Rob. Please send me details of the case you're talking about and I'll look into it & ask questions of those responsible.
About to raise a constituent's case with Ministers in DWP Questions - too many disabled people being badly let down by this Government.
Went to @200DegreesCafe at lunchtime. Great to see the beautiful building's features revealed. Coffee's fine too. Good call @Alexander_Ball
@RobMatthews72 @labourpress @ShabanaMahmood Plenty of hardworking people paying more tax since Coalition raised VAT to 20% . . .

@dibblescook No one wants strikes, least of all firefighters committed to keeping the public safe. Time Govt got back to negotiating table.
@NigelSarbutts as you know Network Rail's budget isn't being used to fund #HS2

Good to hear Cllr Jane Urquhart ask David Higgins & northern leaders abt vital #HS2 connections to Midlands - standing up for Nottingham...
Tories talk about investing in a northern powerhouse & #HS3, the reality is a little different... #actionsnotwords http://t.co/zz34GNtTal
@niteoflight @northernrailorg @NicDakinMP investing in rail infrastructure doesn't mean we can't also invest in our NHS, just the opposite.
I'm on @northernrailorg to Leeds. It's about 70 miles from Nottingham. Takes 2 hours. And people ask why we need #HS2... #connectingcities

.@NonsuchTheatre There are 5 booklets with 5 facts in each at Goose Fair Dinner but I'm missing booklet 3. Great work by sponsors @Geldards
Up to 20,000 geese were walked to Nottm from Lincs for the market to protect their feet a covering of tar & sand was applied #goosefairfacts
In 1927, 12,000 people signed a petition against moving the Fair from the Market Square to Forest Rec. #goosefairfacts
The price of cheese trebled in 1764 causing riots resulting in the Lord Mayor being knocked over by a 100lb cheese. #goosefairfacts
On National Poetry Day it's good to know that 'The Lion and Albert' by Stanley Holloway is based on an unfortunate 1892 Goose Fair incident!
@andydaisyfox Never drink and cycle!

Achievement of the day: going into @FiveLeavesBooks & only buying the book I went in to find.

@1962sb @ninalouise1975 Accept that action carries huge risks but so does inaction. IS are already brutally murdering innocent civilians.
@ninalouise1975 @1962sb Hard decision and respect those who disagree but can assure you not taken without a great deal of soul searching.
@ninalouise1975 @1962sb but air attacks will only help contain IS & provide time for political & diplomatic efforts.
@ninalouise1975 @1962sb I'm sorry but after listening to more than 6 hrs of debate I concluded that it was right to act.
Huge responsibility rests on Parliament today. Thank you to all those constituents who have been in touch to share their views and thoughts.

@Maaiysa Crazy busy day at #Lab14  speaking at lots of fringes so only just got yr msg. Tried calling @BBCNottingham but couldn't get thru
@Harters34 @jamesgleave1 so it's a factor in business location decisions but so will the huge investment in tram/bus/railway stn it funds
@Harters34 @jamesgleave1 which notable employers leaving because of levy?
@Harters34 @jamesgleave1 Your view @cllrgc  @Nik_McD. I'm interested in the evidence - is office space a gd measure of business investment?
"@Lynzyhope: @NottinghamPost @MyNottingham @HappyNottm #goosefair http://t.co/uHHZmaLJwt"< in Manc for #Lab14 but thinking of you Nottm!
@BFTFblog @NottinghamCitz @Ikano_UK I donated to George when he sent it to me  - but will RT again!
@TransportHub @RichardBurdenMP Very sorry I wasn't able to be there for all of it - good debate & discussion.
@beemmjay2011 No she isn't.
@Davidincognac @Godfather19811 @UKLabour Are you suggesting introduction of NMW led to higher prices? Don't think evidence supports that.
@janemerrick23 Didn't need a #macoracoat in Manchester this afternoon!
@Davidincognac @Godfather19811 & course it made a difference - to thousands of workers, some of whom were being paid as little as £1 an hour
@RaviSubbie Get that but given it increased to £7.65 at start of Nov 2013 think comparison feels a bit wrong.
@RaviSubbie LW rate went to £7.65 in Nov 2013?
@jonwillchambers @SianSteans @RaviSubbie Shows NMW increasing twice as fast as it has under the Tories.
@FrancescoLari @cllrjoncollins @ng_labour err....he's a @UKLabour councillor & leader of @ng_labour? & we never take our voters for granted
"@_karin_c: And a fabulous train driving duo of @JonCruddasMP & our own @SarahOwen_  #peoplesrailway http://t.co/f6sTuCVOqw"< !!
@factoidfan @RaviSubbie @UKLabour could well lead to a net saving to the Government as it reduces need for in-work benefits.
@myfirstraygun @SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab @RaviSubbie 2/2 Probably a decent approximation of annual inflation?
@myfirstraygun @SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab @RaviSubbie 1/2 The blue line on the graph rises 2.3% pa (av rise since 2010)
@FrancescoLari The people of St Ann's have been electing @cllrjoncollins since 1987, excuse me if I find your claim a bit unlikely.
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab @RaviSubbie Btw nowt dishonest abt the graph but adding LW would be interesting comparison
@jonwillchambers @SianSteans @HouseofTwitsLab @RaviSubbie The blue line shows NMW rising 2.3% p.a., approx. in line with inflation.
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab @RaviSubbie says he will (but he's driving at the moment)
Nice graph by maths-geek @RaviSubbie Shows @UKLabour's #MinimumWage plan will make a real difference to lowest paid http://t.co/7URHMAIDbg
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab Seen this by @RaviSubbie ? http://t.co/QpAVyeo2WI
Same old Tories claiming £8 min wage will cost jobs. Remember they voted against its intro making the same claim. Wrong then, wrong now
@freshbagcoffee @BFTFblog @UKLabour's Min Wage may be 15 years old but benefits 1m+ workers every day & we'll increase it to £8+ by 2020
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab Agree that's got to be the goal - commitment to raise NMW in real terms is important step
@BFTFblog @uniofleicester That's a timely reminder as we start planning my 2014 Christmas card!
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab 2/2 ...but if you're on £6.50 or even £7.32 then rise to >£8 makes a real difference
@SianSteans @jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab 1/2 Need more employers to pay Living Wage & working with @NottinghamCitz to achieve that...
@nottmcyclist ? Sorry, what reminds you of Upper Parliament St?
@jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab what precedent? it's gone up <10% since 2010
@jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab and your evidence for that is...?
Just remember it was @UKLabour who introduced National Minimum Wage - a pay rise for thousands & thousands of workers - Tories opposed it.
@AlexRJMurray Higher hourly wage rates- lowest earners work part-time and already outside tax.
@jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab Actually UK Living Wage outside London is currently £7.65.
@jonwillchambers @HouseofTwitsLab Err...Minimum Wage abt to go up to £6.50 so £8(+) that would be a rise of >23% - serious uplift.
@alextrentbarton enjoy!
@AlexRJMurray Raising the personal allowance doesn't help the lowest earners, and it's a very inefficient way to target help.
@alextrentbarton ? tell us more!

@WilfordNottm @MyNottingham Hard to believe parking restrictions imposed without local support & remember residents complained abt parking
@WilfordNottm @MyNottingham So when you said "not wanted" you meant people want slower speeds but don't think it will be effective?
@pr4not4profits @DanJarvisMP That said, our team had plenty of conversations with undecided voters in Bishopbriggs today. #LabourNo #indyref
@pr4not4profits @DanJarvisMP Hmmm... are you not familiar with how polling day Get Out The Vote works?

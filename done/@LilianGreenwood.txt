@andywinter26 Yes. Tue Apr 21 22:49:25 BST 2015
@jpm287 @rb66rob Rubbish. Labour's private sector LHA policy never applied to tenants in their existing home. Tue Apr 21 17:25:03 BST 2015
@jpm287 @rb66rob Yes but it's the Tories' Bedroom Tax that's hitting this family Tue Apr 21 17:15:27 BST 2015
@SeraECBaker @cllrsamwebster Build more affordable homes, give councils powers to reduce empty homes... will that do for a start? Tue Apr 21 17:13:53 BST 2015
@SeraECBaker @cllrsamwebster And building more homes! Giving local councils powers to prioritise first time buyers., end land-banking... Tue Apr 21 17:13:04 BST 2015
@SeraECBaker @cllrsamwebster National register of private landlords, ban on unfair letting agent fees, 3 yr tenancies, ceiling on rent rises Tue Apr 21 17:11:17 BST 2015
@rb66rob Precisely why we need a Labour Government so we can scrap the Bedroom Tax! Tue Apr 21 17:08:58 BST 2015
@rb66rob I'm afraid that I think that's right - children of different sex are expected to share a room until eldest is ten. Mad I know. Tue Apr 21 17:08:32 BST 2015
@humairazs Voting Labour is the only way to get rid of the Tories. We have lots of positive policies. Message on mugs a pretty crude summary Tue Apr 21 11:07:15 BST 2015

@rb66rob @NETPhaseTwo Agree it's not good enough - but think it's Taylor Woodrow Alstom/Vinci who have the big questions to answer. Sat Feb 28 12:01:45 GMT 2015
Road dug up again outside Clifton Leisure Centre - worker tells me "it's the wrong concrete". Really?! @NETPhaseTwo http://t.co/LyvYREVQl5 Sat Feb 28 10:28:39 GMT 2015

@RWilkes1 @L_exp rail carrying more people & goods because we've invested billions of taxpayers money in the railway! We need better from it Fri Feb 27 21:17:57 GMT 2015
@RWilkes1 @L_exp @eastcoastuk but taxpayers are paying a lot more to support the privatised railway than they ever did under BR! Fri Feb 27 17:52:01 GMT 2015
Great to join @cllrjoncollins & @leicesterliz for launch of @ng_labour's #Manifesto2015 Ambitious plans for our city http://t.co/BhygIxzWyl Fri Feb 27 12:37:53 GMT 2015

@RWilkes1 Eh? @eastcoastuk has returned a billion pounds in premium payments to the Treasury - impact on PSBR has been positive! Thu Feb 26 22:27:58 GMT 2015
Exciting improvements to Derby Road & hear there's been good partnership between @MyNottingham & local businesses. http://t.co/Lq9REgaSOm Thu Feb 26 22:08:10 GMT 2015
@holdmch @eastcoastuk very much so thanks - but wish there'd been better weather when I got off at Grantham! Thu Feb 26 13:29:28 GMT 2015
@RWilkes1 @eastcoastuk we'll never know whether the public sector could do a better job than Stagecoach because they weren't allowed to bid Thu Feb 26 13:27:12 GMT 2015
@JohnRentoul presumably Greens heaving a sigh of relief about that? Thu Feb 26 10:45:23 GMT 2015
Probably my last journey on a publicly-owned @eastcoastuk train. Shameful Tory Govt put ideology before passengers. http://t.co/rXgxI6cVhe Thu Feb 26 09:04:12 GMT 2015

@dave__stew @UKLabour How is highlighting the rise of low paid, insecure work 'sniping'? It's a real problem affecting people I represent. Wed Feb 25 17:55:13 GMT 2015

@dereklittlewood It's 1 tweet drawing attention to an interview worth listening to, not an alternative to making the case for voting Labour! Tue Feb 24 18:03:06 GMT 2015
@dereklittlewood I'm not attacking her character. It's her inability to explain or defend her Party's policies that is so excruciating. Tue Feb 24 15:37:18 GMT 2015
Thinking of voting #greenparty? Can you bear to listen to this interview with leader,Natalie Bennett?> http://t.co/MGHFm1sTYZ via @audioBoom Tue Feb 24 14:18:12 GMT 2015

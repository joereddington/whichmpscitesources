This govt doesn't like onshore wind, doesn't like solar – one starts to wonder whether there’s any clean energy they actually support?
Govt has admitted it’s made no estimate of reduction in energy capacity or even how much arable land solar has ‘displaced’. Evidenced-based?
Govt’s latest decision on solar farms yet another eg of deserting evidence-based policy which costs jobs and threatens our energy security
Great news #TallShipsRaces2018 coming to Sunderland - the Wear will look amazing
“@edtheduck68: Please sign and send it on @JulieElliottMP @bphillipsonMP http://t.co/uoXrjjtz6V”i have signed the prayer
DEFRA has admitted it's made no estimate of 1. how much arable land is taken up by solar 2. how much this policy will reduce solar capacity
.@meaglemp right to raise issue of DEFRA banning CAP payments for solar farms - govt again costing jobs and threatening our energy security.

Clean energy is popular among public,  problem is change in Tory MPs since 2010. Just 5 MPs voted against 2008 Climate Change Act #power2020
Labour will invest less of our energies trying to leave the EU & instead work with our allies on climate change and fixing EU ETS #power2020
Diverse energy mix crucial but investment in renewables fallen under this govt unsurprising given attacks on onshore wind & solar #power2020
Pleased to speak at #power2020 on 2030 energy mix. We need renewables, nuclear, CCS and focus on energy efficiency. http://t.co/WjJ6YMy1g0

What we need is decent pay and real jobs on real contracts – the only way to do that is to get rid of the Tory-led Gov next May #Sunderland
The cuts are ideologically driven, redistributing wealth away from the poorer areas & in particular the North, to the leafy southern suburbs
The impact of these cuts disproportionately affects women because 65% of public sector workers are women #Sunderland
The local authority in Sunderland has lost £100m from their budget in the last 3 years – The NE has lost 53,000 jobs in the public sector
What this Government has done makes Thatcher look like a pussycat #Sunderland
If cuts had 2 be made they should have bn done fairly & sensibly, neither of those things have applied 2 what this Gov has done #Sunderland
When this Gov took office, led by the Tories & supported by the Lib Dems, the economy was growing, that is a fact #Sunderland
Whatever happens @Tyne_Wear_FRS need to make cuts – That is going to make everyone less safe in T&W and it is not acceptable #Sunderland
Let’s not forget (the threat of closure) is as a result of this Tory-led Government’s cuts #Sunderland
It is unacceptable for Sunderland city centre, one of the largest between Edinburgh & Leeds, not to have a fire station

And just yesterday the Tories and Lib Dems voted against Labour's #freezethatbill. Something to remember when you get your next energy bill.
Tories just don't get that we need an energy mix. Labour will support investment so we can decarbonise at lowest poss cost to the consumer.
@steve_hawkes @EdwardDaveyMP He gave @DECCgovuk 's line, which is quite different from Cameron's. These coalition rows choke off investment.
I didn't get the chance to ask @GregBarkerMP or M Fallon if they support David Cameron's plans for an effective moratorium on onshore wind.
A cap on onshore wind would choke off investment, threaten our energy security and lead to higher bills.
DECC recognises that onshore wind is 'by far the cheapest large-scale renewable energy source that can be deployed at significant scale'
Just asked @EdwardDaveyMP if he supports the PM's call for effective moratorium on onshore wind. No wonder investment halved under this govt

.@EdwardDaveyMP thinks delaying 2030 decarb target will make no difference. He is wrong. Investment has collapsed under this Govt
4 out of 5 green energy projects that have come online since 2010 began under Labour - but investment way down under this Govt
Investment in renewable energy has collapsed under this Govt - lack of 2030 decarb target costs jobs and jeopardises our energy security

Labour is committed to the right policies to respond to the new economic demands of the low carbon era.
There is a green arms race and the UK is in danger of falling behind.
At every step of the way, a Labour a Government will provide the certainty investors seeks.
We need to engage the public and communities, empower councils and community groups.
We need to support growth in our regions, using existing infrastructure and skills which can be adapted to support low carbon technologies.
We need a skills strategy - that means ensuring the rights skills are produced and businesses using their own in house training facilities.
We need to be smarter with public procurement to target money towards more energy efficient avenues.
We need to unlock private investment, which is why we are so clear on the 2030 decarbonisation target.
We need to develop a manufacturing base in addition to installation and maintenance, which would also give us a fantastic export market.
We will create an Energy Security Board to ensure our energy security, identify energy needs and provide a long-term strategic direction.
A Labour Government would legislate to enable the Green Investment Bank to borrow.
It was not the Labour Party that broke the consensus on climate change and renewable energy.
A lack of clarity, stemming from a lack of a decarbonisation target, is having a damaging effect on investment in clean energy.
That is the certainty investors seek, and that is what you will get from a Labour Government.
Labour has supported a 2030 power sector decarbonisation target in opposition, and we will support it in government.
The opportunity is long-term and sustainable economic growth built on innovation, green jobs and low carbon economy.
The transition to a low carbon economy provides a great opportunity for British business.
We will create a new, tougher energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on reductions in wholesale costs to consumers
Labour would create and open pool to open up the market and allow anyone to compete on price.
Reforming the energy market and restoring trust is crucial because otherwise people will wrongly blame renewable energy for driving up bills
Looking forward to addressing @RenewableUK Conference on how Labour's #pricefreeze and market reforms are good for investment and jobs

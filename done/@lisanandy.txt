New powers are welcome. But Osborne's plan seems to give us a Mayor for Greater Manchester who holds power for 3 years before we get a vote.

Wow that was a lively debate on cutting benefits for young people. Well done @soclablaw for organising.
In the chamber for the second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill. 75% payment is 75% justice.
Good point @ChukaUmunna. Osborne's plan is paid for by taxpayers. Energy companies should be made to offer a better deal #murnaghan
Npower prices up £137 today. Osborne's 'promise' to cut bills by £50 will leave people with bills that are £87 higher #notveryhelpful
Long-term youth unemployment is now a crisis. Labour has a compulsory youth jobs guarantee. What are the Tories doing? #marr
Osborne says the economy is recovering...number of people working part-time because they can't get a full-time job is at a record high #marr
George Osborne refuses to freeze energy bills this winter, siding with energy companies instead of families struggling with high costs #marr
#Marr asks @edballsmp, 'what is to stop energy companies putting bills up now?' Not this Govt. Labour will freeze bills to 2017.
3 years of flatlining growth - Tories have borrowed more in the 3 yrs since May 2010 than Lab did in 13 years of government #marr

Just got a worrying letter from Edward Timpson - says Govt is freeing 'ambitious' private providers to deliver children in care placements.
Just debated #bedroomtax on @bbcradiomanc with Tory MP David Nuttall. Cruel and stupid policy which costs more as ppl move to private rents.
@julie_doughty @Brigid39 Speech shows as Baker said, his policies are almost entirely derived from his own experience http://t.co/VLyqN5VwBs
Devastating that if just a few Coalition MPs had done the right thing and voted against the #bedroomtax it would be history (we lost by 26)
"@NorthFighting: @lisanandy Pls can you follow @carrieonfi Your support means a lot❤️ we are from Wigan." > of course, proud to do so.

"@Bleakworldview: @lisanandy Yes. Does he know that poorest pay proportionately more tax through VAT?" he seems to have *forgotten*

Pleasure to see @pjohnny10, @ianbfawu and meet members of the Bakers Union at today's political school.

Pretty disheartening to have a 3 hour debate on zero hours contracts, only to find the Minister doesn't seem to have understood a word of it
Looks like just two Tory MPs will speak in today's zero hours contracts debate, which I suppose is two more than last time.

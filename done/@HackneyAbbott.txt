@waynezantac @KellyCraig85 @ImportantStufff @patcondell It is photoshopped Mon Apr 27 10:06:40 BST 2015
@pigreen Nick Clegg is one person questioning the legitimacy of SNP MPs Mon Apr 27 09:10:21 BST 2015
@pigreen If UK voters vote SNP, that makes those MPs legitimate UK MPs. Mon Apr 27 09:07:44 BST 2015
@Wonderwoody1 @ImportantStufff @limeandonion That poster is a fake. Mon Apr 27 09:00:00 BST 2015
@pigreen So why are people questioning the legitimacy of SNP MP's ? Mon Apr 27 08:59:22 BST 2015
@Filosofizer @ImportantStufff Photoshop Mon Apr 27 08:12:52 BST 2015
@Rowan1953 @ImportantStufff @MightyOak1649 Actually it is a fake photoshopped poster. Mon Apr 27 08:12:13 BST 2015

@StephenAMFry Once again with feeling. The poster is a fake... Sun Apr 26 17:34:25 BST 2015
@BraidenHT Obviously I want everyone in Scotland to vote Labour! But why Clegg trying to delegitimise SNP in recent comments? Sun Apr 26 08:58:04 BST 2015
@ClissoldLabour Scary. EDL guy followed me around when I was there last week. Sat Apr 25 20:46:09 BST 2015
@Martin_Hoscik @ClissoldLabour Could it be that there are TWO Mr Rossi's or maybe he has a double?#oneoflifesmysterys üç¶ Sat Apr 25 19:33:40 BST 2015

@colingale @kiffr I would prefer that @UKLabour did not have to a deal with anyone. But concerned at delegitimising of SNP voters. Sat Apr 25 14:59:05 BST 2015
@PeterKenyon Voting @UKLabour is the best option & does solve problem! But still query delegitimising of SNP MPs. Sat Apr 25 07:58:23 BST 2015
Why people increasingly questioning legitimacy of SNP MPs? Do we only respect choices of Scottish voters if they vote for the "right" party? Sat Apr 25 07:52:52 BST 2015
If UK voters vote for SNP makes them legitimate UK MPs. So how can Clegg dismiss any deal involving SNP? http://t.co/GpIUBXJHhP #FT Sat Apr 25 07:47:29 BST 2015
@bucko46 @TheRedRag @Ed4PM No. Sat Apr 25 05:16:43 BST 2015

@DredaMitchell @jamieandhisego Transcedent figure you require is perfection. Try voting for someone whose program you ( mostly!) support. Sat Mar 07 22:28:05 GMT 2015
@lyonsness @DredaMitchell Nothing brave or clever about not voting. Just handing over power to big money & big media. Sat Mar 07 22:25:04 GMT 2015
@lyonsness @DredaMitchell "Voting with your feet" is not voting i.e. giving your power away. Sat Mar 07 22:21:55 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell @jamieandhisego I think John Lewis would say, you shouldn't wait for a perfect politician to come along. Just use your vote. Sat Mar 07 22:20:32 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell @jamieandhisego People not bothering to vote at all fatal for democracy. Sat Mar 07 22:17:11 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell @jamieandhisego They could not afford the luxury of "disillusionment" then. We cannot afford it now. Sat Mar 07 22:16:15 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell @jamieandhisego 50 years ago the people who marched in Selma had every reason to be disillusioned. Sat Mar 07 22:15:07 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell Voting is not an existential act. It's about having your say. Alternative to democracy is oligarchy. Sat Mar 07 22:13:26 GMT 2015
@jamieandhisego @DredaMitchell Voting not about legitimising a politico. About having your say. Only alternative to democracy is oligarchy. Sat Mar 07 22:11:21 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell Its not complex. They are giving away their power. Period. Sat Mar 07 22:08:24 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell Not complex. People who can't be bothered to vote don't realise "they are giving away their power" Need to be put right. Sat Mar 07 22:05:11 GMT 2015
@DredaMitchell: 'We give away our power by not voting,' Obama address at Selma. Never more relevant. Sat Mar 07 21:52:17 GMT 2015

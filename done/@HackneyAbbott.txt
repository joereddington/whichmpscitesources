@tcliverpool I am an #Arsenal supporter. I share his distress.
@BMUSANU That is exactly what my guy was saying!
My fellow 38 bus traveller continues: "Supporters need to stop going to #Arsenal home games. Then maybe the board will listen..."
On the 38 bus. Man complaining loudly on his phone about #Arsenal losing to Man U "I'm telling you. Wenger needs to go..."
@SarahLysecki Apologise for not saying hello!

@MessierMessiah Obama is a Christian. Why shouldn't he talk about God?

@fruitbatob @SimonDanczuk @steveflatman Nobody "asks" for wages. Employers ( absent strong trade unions and national living wage) set them.
@SimonDanczuk @kevwright1 @jonnymstorey Why does speaking up against scapegoating immigrants mean you believe in uncontrolled immigration?
@seanjmcg @TheGrumpyBitch @SimonDanczuk Planning may be socialism in action.  Scapegoating immigrants is not.
@kevwright1 @jonnymstorey @SimonDanczuk Strong trade unions stop labour exploitation.
@DuncanGray All of those things may be true. But the quotation that you cite is a fabrication.
@wolfofwentworth @genophilia Nope. I never said that.
@jonnymstorey @SimonDanczuk Plenty for government to do enforcing minimum wage, strengthening TU rights & freedoms etc
@SimonDanczuk @steveflatman No my point is that Employers are responsible for exploiting their workers.

@timgrimsditch It does indeed seem odd not to base it on the total portfolio. Will also encourage subdivision of property.
@cjfaraway I do not blame you for not having empathy!
@jakey06 If you read the article, you will see that I am in favour of a mansion tax in principle.

@jameswhartonmp
Great to speak at a dinner for @forbritain tonight, back out on the campaign trail in Stockton tomorrow.
Great to welcome Minister @PennyMordauntMP to Stockton South to sign Teesside's growth deal. Over £90m for our area! http://t.co/PgzgdeTT2p
@PaulBrandITV @AngusMacNeilMP @russellbrownmp is that pic from take one or two? ;)
Tonight I'll be on Around The House with @PaulBrandITV
@kellychequer very fair point!
Good meeting with doctors from the NE in Parliament this morning.  Lots to discuss. http://t.co/VhnKIPdPgO
Our area is getting better because our #longtermeconomicplan is working for local people. Lots done, lots more to do! http://t.co/SaFk7YkPrK
@dhm17 yup. Trust agree it's what's needed if Wynyard doesn't go ahead.
Meeting with great local candidates in Yarm then in Parkfield- really positive response, good to chat to residents. http://t.co/QFkeJV9lKv
@tsprog apart from one known Lab activist the residents were lovely.  We had a really good chat.
@tsprog of the residents in the room 3 weren't anything to do with them and came about something else!
Not long ago Mark Reckless wrote to me abt how only @Conservatives can deliver an EU Referendum #RochesterandStrood http://t.co/hD42dKY1ey
Delighted to have such a well attended surgery in Yarm, though the people from Unite the union who aren't constituents weren't allowed in.
A great speech about mental health by Stockton's MYP @jessicaebelch in Parliament. It's important we challenge stereotypes. #ukyp14
Good to visit Woodlands Playgroup in Yarm. A popular and well liked local charity. http://t.co/3xa4SSHqI0
Good first meeting at the office, now seeing @ClevelandPolice about a few issues.
Nearly 11pm and my opponent is arguing about being a Liverpool Cllr + running a Liverpool business, or not... another late night outburst.
@RiversideRed_ it's cooperation in some areas only.
@ACunninghamMP I'm against a PFI hospital at Wynyard if that's what you mean.
@ACunninghamMP so is Labour officially against TTIP now?
Unemployment down again in Stockton South in October. JSA claimants 622 lower than in Oct 13 and 53 lower than Sept 14. Good news!
Stunning red lighting on London Eye tonight for #RemembranceDay. Phone camera doesn't do it justice. http://t.co/xCAy0azWIf
It is sign of extreme weakness and desperation that 100 Labour candidates have had to sign a letter "supporting" Ed Miliband. #dividedparty
Congratulations to @BenHouchen who is the new Conservative Group Leader on Stockton Council. Great choice, look forward to working with him.
Tonight Ken Lupton retired as Conservative Group Leader on Stockton Council.  He has been a real pleasure to work with and has done a lot.
Labour, trying to be too clever by half with Parliamentary procedure, have closed down debate on the European Arrest Warrant! Not clever.
Work continues at #Eaglescliffe station car park this morning. On my way to London! http://t.co/TFtJR66KcR
@Mitch_Al1966 you should have checked facts first, damage is done. I'll be in touch as this is not going away. You crossed a line yesterday.
@Mitch_Al1966 you nd to remove entire post. Was long after service and before salute began. I will correspond formally rather than on here.
Yesterday in Germany they remembered the fall of the Berlin Wall, today this is happening in Ukraine http://t.co/tQx1XjY9RN
@Mitch_Al1966 @TeessideCF not true tho is it Al? This smear + lie goes too far and you and Graham will be hearing from my solicitor shortly.
Another important event to remember today, Europe has changed so much and is changing still. http://t.co/64rQFTd8hO
@ajduffell @TerryFBH how odd.  There were good crowds today tho, nice ppl attend. Got a photo for my newsletter. http://t.co/atE5lRj0AL
@TerryFBH Lab activist, Andrew Duffell, after shameful attack on me today using remembrance I'm going to reveal some things in newsletter.
Great turnout at today's Remembrance Service in Stockton.  I attend every year but is a particularly poignant one.
Just seen a deer in the trees on Yarm Rd right opposite the junction to Aislaby. Cars queuing didn't notice! http://t.co/OClPIMUFmH

My good friend and great North East advocate Martin Callanan takes his seat in the House of Lords today. Pleased to attend the introduction.
Good to have coffee with former Labour Parkfield and Oxbridge Councillor Roy Rix in Parliament today to discuss pensioners issues.
I've just voted against gender based abortion, supporting Fiona Bruce MP's 10 minute rule Bill.
@JLeathleyUKIP @ACunninghamMP it has lots of cash, running a surplus of £7.5m and should definitely reduce taxes #butitslabour
Vending machines stocking Christmas coke on 1 November. Seriously? http://t.co/4ArZM09qfH
@NIAUK didn't know the No. but knew there are quite a few- Hartlepool just up the road.
@MasonBreen have very limited powers over but happy to raise any specific issues or concerns.  Liaise with police a lot + this does come up!
@blueshirt113 it was a debate on transport. Whatever your politics don't you think that response rather unnecessary!?
We recently had a debate in Westminster Hall about NE Transport.  This was my contribution: https://t.co/ykrYgnpTvm
@Mayday_magazine Hey Trevor, you have no manners.

Great @EveningGazette coverage of my visit of Oxbridge Lane Primary. Impressive school and brilliant School Council. http://t.co/p38DztPyZR
A steady flow of visitors at the Preston Park bridge information meeting in #Eaglescliffe tonight. http://t.co/zhk5u84tVe
Really impressive meeting with the School Council at Oxbridge Lane Primary to hear about all the good work they are doing.  Well done!
Extremely good meeting with the new head of Egglescliffe School, clearly lots of positive things happening.
@ablelearner can you send me a quick email re this: james.wharton.mp@parliament.uk inc your home address and I'll look into for you :)
@RosieHare why not come along to a surgery?  Id be happy to discuss your concerns :)
Done quick interviews for @BBCTees and @BBCLN regarding the decision to suspend work on Wynyard Hospital.  Time to invest in North Tees!
@Closey25 @RiversideRed_ treasury asked them for more info- they said no we'll just stop work. Same effect I suppose.
@RiversideRed_ we do, anyone can become a member of the health Trust and vote on how it's run. http://t.co/pEd1aEx5t4
My statement on the Wynyard Hospital news: https://t.co/oPaRkMb0A9
Wynyard Hospital plans are to be suspended.  Will please a lot of people!
@NHS_July51948 you have no idea how much damage you do yourselves and your cause by being such a blatant front for party politics.
@NHS_July51948 @srmooreuk so are you saying Unite has not given you any money /behind you or are you now misleading?
@srmooreuk @NHS_July51948 @ElectoralCommUK need to see your tweet.
@nicholaswatt @PaulGoodmanCH @PaulBrandITV @daily_politics @chrisshipitv @reporterboy @christopherhope see last tweet re Union campaigning.
Journos, here is a Unite funded political campaign>  @NHS_July51948 I've reported to @ElectoralCommUK which will test if they do their job.
.@NHS_July51948 big test for  @ElectoralCommUK here- if they do their job they'll be looking at your non disclosure.
.@NHS_July51948 does Unite the Union pay for the stamps?
.@NHS_July51948 looks like @ElectoralCommUK needs to investigate your campaign activities and non declaration of funding.  Lobbying Act?
@NHS_July51948 it is disclosed, hence you know about it.  Does @ElectoralCommUK know about your political campaign activities and funding?
.@NHS_July51948 I answer all emails from constituents so get one to email in :) in the meantime how much ££ do you get from Unite the union?
@NHS_July51948 you sound a bit flustered. Just be open and honest, Unite fund you don't they?
.@NHS_July51948 @loweryhomes Unite funded attack campaign use NHS as political football + dismiss local businesses and employers? Shameful.
@kyle_dunford funnily enough we took this up today.  Could you send me an email? James.wharton.mp@parliament.uk
.@NHS_July51948 I'm only asking if Unite the Union fund you? Not about anyone else. So, do they?
@NHS_July51948 how much has Unite put in?
@NHS_July51948 are you Unite funded or backed in any way? No denial I note. Are you lobbying act compliant?
@NHS_July51948 fact is you are in Stockton S because local Labour barely exists. Unite pays and none of you are from here. It'll backfire.
Personal attacks from Unite the Unions NHS campaign now.  Seems it's not really about the NHS. What a surprise.
Think Labour can be trusted with the NHS? They run it in Wales, here's what happens! http://t.co/P3b5aK3TkH
@hoppy1848 @Spock_Thornaby  sarcasm, I was criticising the tweet- whether a legit act or not whoever runs it should be ashamed.
“@StockSth4UKIP: @Spock_Thornaby That's because you are a sad wanker. Some people nd to be put down 4 their own good. Lefty toss pot!” Nice.
@johnnield2 the more you talk to people who have experienced the NHS in Wales the worse it sounds.
Labour campaigns shamelessly on the NHS to scare people into voting for them. When they are in charge, though: http://t.co/7iXNUsy9cl
@AlanHewitt10 if you can send me details in an email i will raise with council for you?
Strong crowds for the riding of the fair in #Yarm this morning. http://t.co/plp7VVD277
@tim_rigby wow. Just. Wow. Nasty, personal and using war dead to make a Twitter attack.  You're a special kinda troll.
On my way home and love the Remembrance poppy at Kings Cross station! http://t.co/s3Zc4JDI78
About to go on @daily_politics to discuss EU Bill and our commitment to #LetBritainDecide
Just re-read that exchange with @ACunninghamMP. No wonder people are put off politics. We should both know better and I'll end it here.
@ACunninghamMP does Lab not do substitutes on Bill committees or were you scared to defend Stockton Lab cuts to buses which people need...
Something's upset @ACunninghamMP today. Spending his time attacking me.  He has form on personal attacks. http://t.co/EVPc5CWQcV
@ACunninghamMP strangely Lab doesn't give me notice even on things that should be cross party.  Where were you in NE Transport debate?
@ACunninghamMP more unprovoked attacks. Your track record of attacking political opponents is nasty politics.  You should be ashamed.
. @ACunninghamMP someone has to fight for our town.  I pay people properly too http://t.co/Eb2U4dXucc
Unusually it's a Friday sitting in Parliament.  @neill_bob is bringing an EU referendum Bill, I'm here to support! http://t.co/5EnH3DWLL9
@Box_File he needed to write something I suppose.  I won't lose sleep :)
@Box_File yes. Congratulating someone is not supporting them and Peter should know better.
@ChrisAdams89 haha maybe not!
Full time employment up 422,000 over the year, increase in part-time 62,000 and self-employment just under 280,000. Real jobs being created.
@Chris_Cockerill many do.
@Chris_Cockerill must have referendum.  Would want to see a better deal but without one would personally vote to leave.
@MikeBGazette @mjt2509 how could I forget you? :)
@MikeBGazette @mjt2509 I'll give you great odds against :)
@glindsay34 @EveningGazette @Conservatives there was an election for it so it would take a very poorly informed cynic.
In Stockton South unemployment down again: 658 lower than Sept '13, 136 lower than Aug '14! More jobs + security for families + individuals.
@anthhutchy I think people are informed enough to understand the choice they face here and my position on the EU is clear :)
@anthhutchy secured money for roads in Ingleby, money for schools in Stockton (Ian Ramsey and Grangefield) and secured a LEP for Teesside.
.@HelenGoodmanMP concerned pot holes mean mud brought into homes + "women have to clean it up" Imagine lefty reaction if a tory said that...
@Cooky34 indeed.  Still much to do but it is falling, which is welcome.
Just spoken in a debate about transport in the NE. Lots of important issues to discuss. Positive and constructive cross party debate so far.
UK unemployment falls below 2m.  Great news which means more people in work and more security for all. Long term economic plan is working.
@HonourInvestor it is up to my opponent who she has on her team.  When she came over from Liverpool she had to cobble something together.
@lpf07 send me an email to james.wharton.mp@parliament.uk and Id be pleased to explain why that is inaccurate.
Delighted to have been elected to the Board of the Party by my fellow @Conservatives MPs.
Just done a quick interview for @BBCLN   about today's strike action.  I respect the right to strike but today's strike is wrong.
@ScouseMattSmith hope not, working hard and response on doors is good.  Really is a case of go to bed with Farage wake up with Miliband tho!
@Conor_BurnsMP great having you here!
Brilliant days campaigning in Ingleby Barwick and Stockton with @roadtrip2015 amazing response from residents. http://t.co/uXZwwdI3zd
@Mrsthirsty1 given who it, yes, it's just he's also joking about it as doesn't see the seriousness. often hear of nasty things they spread.
Rare confession by a local Labour activist that they just make things up (lie) to score political points. Nasty. http://t.co/BDtUSFQjSC
@mabel1236 clearly you haven't followed the constituency polls. I'll stand on my record and people will decide.
@DouglasCarswell always a pleasure.  Staying put though (for any media speculators!)
Lots of by election spinning going on. Main parties got a kick from the public which should not be ignored. Congrats to @DouglasCarswell
@UKELECTIONS2015 not a chance!
http://t.co/yRXTkd8kAq @Coppinger4pcc approved these payments on police authority, was wrong then or he's wrong now. Either way looks bad!
Pleased govt is to increase minimum pay for the lowest paid apprentices. http://t.co/tCytVzRkDG Sorry @ACunninghamMP http://t.co/Eb2U4dXucc
Quick (quite croaky!) interview for @BBCTees first thing this morning regarding the benefits system.
@almostangie not aware of it?
Good surgery at #Thornaby ASDA.  Lots of different issues raised. Thanks to Josh from @yarmschool for being a great help today!
Great to perform the official opening of #Eaglescliffe's new Post Office.  A much needed local service. http://t.co/QITohjoQXW
Good discussion with @yarmschool politics students this morning.  Lots of great questions!  Interestingly one asked about votes at 16.
Brilliant visit to Ingleby Manor School with @IMFTrust such an amazing place and achievement.  So proud of them all. http://t.co/7yqDvppE1t
Looks like the specially designed railings are going in around #Yarm's refurbished war memorial today. http://t.co/hDBnZTt9Ze
Next election a clear choice: securing our future + putting things right or a huge risk with Labour who wrecked things before + would again.
Investment in the #NHS guaranteed by @David_Cameron - only possible because our #LongTermEconomicPlan is securing a better future.
PM absolutely right to pledge first £12.5k tax free and raise the level at which the top rate kicks in to £50k. Will help a lot of ppl.
Supporting Global Friends of Ukraine at #cpc14 we must stand up for freedom in Europe. http://t.co/rLYGAYMcU7
Good to support the Cancer Research UK stand at conference. #beatcancersooner http://t.co/quwsquYpi5
Amazing that Stockton South Labour apparently thinks a £23k pa cap on benefits is unfair.  More than many people earn. #outoftouch
@teessiderad you think a cap at still well over £20k pa is too low?  I don't.
@teessiderad because it would just be passed to customers and would potentially destroy the city of London which pays a huge amount of tax.
@teessiderad this govt has taken more tax from bankers bonuses and done more to tackle tax avoidance than any other- inc 13 years of labour.
Useful meeting with @TPExpressTrains to talk about a range of issues. Look forward to seeing them in the NE soon too.
Good of the Transport Secretary to mention all our work to secure investment for the NE in his speech. Pleased we are a top priority.
@DrKatyShaw true, but saying "don't talk to me" because you have one is. Sad.
@DrKatyShaw must be tough being so blinkered.
@MrHarryCole sorry!
Insert "reckless" pun here [  ]. But seriously, disappointing + foolish decision by Mark. Only @Conservatives can + will give EU referendum.
Affordable homes for first time buyers built on brownfield. A good + welcome policy + reason to vote @Conservatives http://t.co/pAdhG5RWVR
Pleased strikes on #ISIL risen above party politics. Too important for that. I stand by comments to @EveningGazette http://t.co/Go5wa3hXhB
Tonight I voted for action against #ISIL terrorists, help requested by the government of Iraq to stop the spread of evil and save lives.
@chellingsen email office@jameswharton.co.uk :)
@chellingsen Hmm, you shouldnt get the same one twice!  Sorry about that, could you let me know which one and your address and Ill sort.
@chellingsen here all year round, not just at election time :)
@LukeJohnFrost thank you for your kind words Luke, appreciated.
@MackemKTF Spain?
Parliament recalled Friday. We cannot stand by whilst evil is done. We have a moral responsibility given recent past in the region.  #ISIS

@PaulGoodmanCH @GutoBebb don't let anyone ever doubt the influence of @ConHome
@LordAshcroft @PaulGoodmanCH @GutoBebb @ConHome I'd have you there if it were down to me!
@AdamMcquade @BBCNews not my area are you :) #arrogantassumption
@mickbone63 true, I don't comment to the Echo as they are such a disgracefully biased paper.
Pleased to be meeting the PM re devolution tomorrow at this: http://t.co/0i9uvNm5An I'll be making the case for the North of England.
@jandavey maybe, RM still accept it. Problem is people have diff preferences: Cleveland, N Yorks, Teesside, Stockton. Can't please everyone!
Has Gordon Brown forgotten he's not PM now? What on earth does he think he's doing!? @BBCNews headlining it? #indyref http://t.co/cwPhCJC2q4

@mkempson always happy to correspond by email or you can come along to a surgery (see website for dates).  Tho please do survey too :)
@Puffles2010 @DArcyTiP depends what Scotland gets, but I'd rather see enterprise zones expanded than RDAs re established, for example.
@leamad23 a small bus with rates of £53k!? Seems odd.  If you live in Stockton South email me details inc home address and I'll look into.
@leamad23 very sympathetic, business rates need reforming, it's why this govt gave small businesses a tax break https://t.co/FdIpBRyf2Q
@macthesmoggy do you get my regular newsletter? If not I'll look into why, they are more about what I'm doing locally than EU/other things.
@macthesmoggy in fairness it's not like I haven't been working on the issue!  But thanks for letting me know letters arrived ok :)
@RichieJenkinson need both!
A great result for Scotland and the UK, just done @BBCTees and got @ITVtynetees in a bit. Now we need a proper settlement for England too.
@RichieJenkinson not if can be avoided, we comprehensively rejected a regional assembly in the NE. But must get a fair deal for England...
@dmdistribution welcome to quote though reliability is primary concern over just price.  Please email stefan@jameswharton.co.uk
“@LabourPolicies: official, Labour will end the Tory Free School Programme if we win the 2015 Election.”- bad news for Ingleby Barwick!
MT: "@kevin_nicholas5: Mr Wharton is only here all year round.” It's all I can manage in fairness Kevin, but thanks for the endorsement!
@maxjfreeman sorry you will need to approach your own MP.  Thanks.
@DeanBensonVS can you email me re this? James.wharton.mp@parliament.uk as I have some info for you.
@freeaerozepplin read and don't agree, also it has a go at all main parties but you target one, hmm.
@DeanBensonVS don't sign petitions but will definitely look into this.  Disappointing news especially given apparent reason.
@PaulBrandITV aren't you planning on doing that anyway!? :)
@PaulBrandITV thanks.  Similar to my survey!  I'll do your next one half price :)

@ACunninghamMP sorry Alex but you throw around "libel" + quibble over 7p ph.  You'd be best to leave it and not get involved in such things.

@UTBjohn @adamrichyarm clearly still an issue meeting demand! I'll ask them about it.
@Lurcher2010 @ITVtynetees anyone would think it's where I live.
@adamrichyarm @ITVtynetees I use Eaglescliffe and have never had a problem. Have you submitted a formal complaint?
Quick recording for @ITVtynetees in #Yarm High St. about the NHS - we're protecting its budget, Labour said we should cut it!
@VintageSingerCL if you want to send me an email I'll see what I can find out for you- might be a bit early for works estimates yet.
@chrismnixon sorry you don't support, you know it's only a small part of two roads at key junction?  If you want any info/detail email :)
Delighted to unveil the name "Joseph" for Rembering Rebecca charity prize dog at the @InglebyBarwickC farmers market! http://t.co/bXhsqySwFq
Good of the great @RobertJenrick to join us out in the doors meeting residents today. http://t.co/D0S2R7uY34
@digitalwin haha alas mine is not so neat!  Where's my note from you? :p
A resident dashed past and handed me this rather nice note at my #Tesco surgery.  Kind :) http://t.co/ioDgiN46b4
Busy surgery at #Tesco in #InglebyBarwick this afternoon, lots of residents came over to say hi :)
Despite the rain it's quite warm here at the International Fire Training Centre at Teesside Airport! http://t.co/fJeKmaCrnY
Lots if positive things happening in #Teesside. We need to talk it up and challenge anyone talking it down! http://t.co/MWffE3JFUF
@JamieRobsonlufc it's infrastructure, access etc.  Still doesn't solve the lack of flights problem sadly!
Delighted to see the excellent @MichaelFallonMP on twitter, coincidence that I'll be seeing our mutual friend @GrahamRobb this afternoon!
Congratulations to all those across Teesside getting their A Level results today!  Some great achievements by local young people.
Really interesting @BNIEnterprise event at Judges #Yarm, lots of local businesses doing great things, not so keen on the 6.30am start tho!
@kevin_nicholas5 you should be recycling Kev!  Shocking.
A country club in #Yarm? New pool? traffic? If you live in Yarm let them know what you think! https://t.co/fQV1DgMk1A
Today's figures mean the biggest annual unemployment fall for 25 years + for youth unemployment since records began! http://t.co/ndN9Ljtdgx
@badlywornboy indeed, I am ready to return if it is, this is important stuff and terrible things are happening.
Good news: unemployment falls again in #Stockton South. Now 699 lower than Jul 13 + 37 lower than Jun 14 thanks to our #longtermeconomicplan
@parkin1991 I don't, have a look at voting records, I attend more often but it's true I don't go and read prepared party speeches.
@stumain not yet, it's in my diary for 11am if I can get away from Parliament for it.  Ask a bit nearer and I'm sure I'll have the detail :)
Oh good, latest edition of my regular intouch newsletter has arrived. Here all year round, not just at election time! http://t.co/lwZGngwBs6
@BlueBorders1 shortage of characters on twitter sadly!
Local Labour cant accept falling unemployment thanks to our #longtermeconomicplan seems its a problem nationally too http://t.co/3PpX5rfCDq

@FarahCF1998 thanks so much for the help, it's really appreciated :)
@nworB_nadnerB haha, fair observation but so many IB people had raised it with me it seemed of most concern/relevance there tbh.
Just arriving for my #Yarm library surgery. 4.30-5.30 today for anyone passing by.
@QueenKyrn lots of local things, flood prevention, pollution issues, leisure access to Tees etc
Good meeting with the Environment Agency this morning to discuss a range of local issues, very useful.
@borolad345 also I've personally worked hard to secure investment in our area, would Lab MP have managed? Dunno- haven't got as much nearby.
@borolad345 wondered if ud get my regular leaflets which have detailed much of what's been happening. Doubt we would be recovering with lab.
@borolad345 NI break has led directly to people getting work too.  Do you live in IB? Unemployment in my patch down every month last year.
@borolad345 btw RGF investment in Teesside has been over £200m and our #longtermeconomicplan is getting the whole country back on track. :)
@borolad345 sorry you missed my question.  I'll rephrase: had unemployment increased by 32% rather than reduced would people blame govt?
@borolad345 would you be blaming the govt if it went up?
With #InglebyBarwick being a 'new' town I spend a lot of time trying to secure funding for infrastructure + services. http://t.co/fElK2K44tr
Delighted Martin Callanan, who gave the NE such great service as an MEP for 15 years, is to enter the Lords as Lord Callanan of Low Fell :)

Quick interview with @clairemitv in Egglescliffe Village in the beautiful sunshine looking down over #Yarm for @ITVtynetees
@PaulBrandITV haha ignore him (her?) one of my personal online stalker trolls :)  local Labour don't like it when we get things done here.
@PaulBrandITV careful or we will do you a graphic... :)
I'm lucky to live in #Eaglescliffe close to #Yarm.  I'm even luckier to represent such great people in Parliament. http://t.co/bfvRejfLCy
@johnnield2 or even slight without the e, it's late!
@johnnield2 hands up and admit I'm surprised- apols no sleight intended.
@CallumParry1 it's an SBC designed scheme too!
@CallumParry1 indeed can't make it too long! :)
@johnnield2 @Mattivic you're a floating voter now? Or is that someone else?  Happy to send an envelope but let's be honest?
@johnnield2 @Mattivic oh dear!  There should have been a freepost envelope?
@p_atr_ick @LouiseMensch Not really, the gypsy and traveller community didnt want the proposed sites either!  They supported the campaign.
One of the great places I represent is #Thornaby. A lot's happened in recent years, let's keep it getting better :) http://t.co/REioI0niR5

@Yarmismint oh and give my best to Mrs H, always lovely and pleasant.
@Yarmismint party politics should and usually is kept out of it. Offer to meet stands, I don't understand your reluctance, otherwise Gnight.
@Yarmismint that a no to coffee? How come? Afraid your prejudice against me will be challenged? Don't use remembrance for politics please.
@Yarmismint hi Fred- it's great it was organised and such a success :). Well done all involved. Why the issues with me tho? Coffee sometime?
@JNaqui @conmill27 @odwalker94 haha, you should meet that one before you comment. Anyway I won't feed the trolls so Gnight!
@conmill27 careful, your 3 followers might see that and think less of you.
@JNaqui oh well, it's a standing offer should you reconsider :)
@JNaqui sorry to hear that. Come to one of my regular surgeries if you like- judge me on who I am rather than what you feel or have read :)
@JNaqui @TeessideCF @IsaacDuffy1998 you do have a lot to say (as your profile states) try saying nice things instead #itsbetter :)
@tsprog course not! I supported work on grandparents rights in parl a while back, it's a difficult area we aren't getting right.
@tsprog oh don't get me started on them!  I did some family law when I trained as a solicitor.  Such sad cases.
@TerryFBH some nasty people in politics, don't let them get you down- stay positive and keep smiling :)
@MackemKTF Ha!
I'm sorry, but how is this justice? He either committed a crime or didn't, he shouldn't be able to pay off the court! http://t.co/pz3BWt7Prb
@GSmalley1 possibly, if you live in Stockton South? Please email details inc your home address to james.wharton.mp@parliament.uk
@Chewies_Dad @pupaid I'll be in Parliament but I'm afraid this is not a votable motion- ie it can't change the law, just a debate.
@SeanRowe8 do you live in constituency? Why so cynical and negative?  Even if our politics is different doesn't mean can't agree on some.
@SeanRowe8 always do, proud of my record.  Thanks for feedback :)
@SeanRowe8 where is that from? here's a promise, I've spent less than £10 on fb in last week, like my page for more interesting info :p
@SeanRowe8 haha then don't?  How much is what?

@PaulBrandITV Actually it shows a 3 (the how would you vote in Stockton South question). But polls will go up and down.

Just been on @BBCTees with @GREENYFROM4 to discuss the news @WilliamJHague is retiring. Great loss to politics and our area! Wish him well.
@DavidJonFindlay thanks, but I am happy to support whatever happens :) focused on Stockton!
@_davidrhodes no! :) Stockton born and raised.
@GeneralDalgardo there has been demand for a pool for years, but I'm afraid I can't see a leisure centre happening any time soon :(
Just leaving the beautiful village of Cherry Burton where I was pleased to support my great colleague @@grahamstuart's supper club.
@ACunninghamMP @TeesYoungLabour oh and Phil got an apology before his first point of order!
@ACunninghamMP @TeesYoungLabour did I? Where?
Sorry to hear that @iswales is stepping down at the next election.  We don't always agree but he has been a good MP for Teesside.

@readingaid @preston_andy of course, I was reselected well over a year ago!
@IanFleming1973 @BBCLN my original point that the BBC should have fully disclosed an interviewees union position remains unanswered.
@IanFleming1973 @BBCLN is that confirmation that she doesn't get any facility time?
@SharonGrahams97 @andrewpercy @BBCLN @BBCRichardMoss did the BBC know unison have on their website that you are a senior steward?
@SharonGrahams97 did you tell the BBC you are on unisons website as a senior steward? @BBCLN
@SharonGrahams97 http://t.co/V3ohkxWDsN
. @SharonGrahams97 @BBCLN @BBCRichardMoss id like BBC to introduce union senior stewards as such rather than presenting as average workers.
@preston_andy thanks Andy- know our politics don't always align!
The striking worker @bbcln used in my interview last night seems to be a hardline union activist: @SharonGrahams97 oh dear @BBCRichardMoss
@tsprog fair enough, 1 of the problems with this job- people forget you're a person with what they say sometimes! I find best not to engage
@tsprog don't feed the trolls :)
I've done regional BBC and ITV about strikes. Ed Miliband has said nothing. Wonder why? #EdsSponsoredSilence http://t.co/fG4TascIR0

Beautiful morning for Mayors Sunday in #Stockton and to see how town centre regen progressing! http://t.co/rPwmzbeHGV
@bevglossylips we've stopped Labours plan to cut NHS funding and increased it year on year.  Take your union blinkers off- look at Wales.
@bevglossylips I don't think so, but you're entitled to your view.
So Labour now wants to increase NI (less pay for us all) and inc tax on farms (food costs up).  Interesting way to help the cost of living!
@allipem @ScottWood29 this has been picked up on and we are looking into grants to try to sort something. :)
@keithduffell I remember that too.  Though the Rookery is more attractive than the old station was.  Well, it was.
Sad to see this once stunning building in such disrepair.  Soon to be gone for apartments. #Eaglescliffe http://t.co/3RM1aIUpr2

Economic growth means more jobs and security for everyone, thanks to our #LongTermEconomicPlan http://t.co/AnAxljjNT0
This years local elections were in areas favouring Labour, driving up Euro turnout. Without that they could have bn 3rd! Bad for opposition.
@jbelmont1980 2/2 vote same way.  Just for clarity I didn't organise or fund it, I just respect residents' rights to parish poll.
@jbelmont1980 probably not possible, as I have always said poll is indicative not binding, though my own surveys show kirk would vote 1/2
The use of legit opinion polls to influence rather than inform politics is an interesting current phenomenon http://t.co/PSgknBE2ph
@jbelmont1980 lol, I'll speak as I find + ppl will decide how they vote, your comment was ignorant and ill judged, so I called you on it.
@jbelmont1980 @yarm4yorkshire silly petty comment, about the way the council acts not this, clearly you have not followed the issue at all.
Considering the circumstances 24% turnout is pretty good and 89% voting to return to Yorkshire is clear, impressive effort @yarm4yorkshire!
@Calum92Stevens whilst there is some truth in that I think its more complex too.  We will see what happens next :)
Euros were certainly not good for Labour, but the UKIP factor makes it hard to draw concrete conclusions.  http://t.co/JWqfjfP5XW
@cimacpherson @IBCommunityNews he's a lab activist, and that result would be neck and neck in Stockton South so he's also a fantasist.
A strong Cons result in Stockton which should worry Labour, but saddened to lose our great MEP Martin Callanan in the NE tonight.
@peterchinnery @yarm4yorkshire difficult as it's never been Yorkshire, being north of river.  Lots of frustration with @stocktoncouncil tho.
@TR1CKY @yarm4yorkshire not sure we are at such a stage yet (long way to go) but impossible to tell tbh
@SwLiberty email me if you want more detail, plz inc a full postal address :) 2/2
@SwLiberty possibly nothing, I object to the secrecy and lack of consultation - tho I do have concerns abt the policy as well. 1/2
@LordAshcroft intersting poll, do you think naming candidates (as on ballot) on "in your constituency" vi qu would be worth doing?
My Labour opponent is in another twitter fight, this time with a guy from Liverpool. Often seems to happen late at night. #putthephonedown
No local elections in #Stockton so have to wait for Euro results on Sunday.  From locals nationally Labour not on course for next year!
@hcmltd I've been out busily knocking on doors, pretty good response too :)
Polling stations are open 7am-10pm.  Please use your vote today and #voteconservative!
Tomorrow is polling day for the European elections.  Here in the NE we have a great MEP in Martin Callanan #voteconservative to keep him!
A really interesting meeting with 20+ Drs from across the region, helpful discussion about a number of local issues.
@kevin_nicholas5 oh Kevin, your criticism cuts deep, yet you come to all my #InglebyBarwick surgeries and are so nice!
That @LordAshcroft can publish polls without any serious suggestion of bias shows how successfully he has est. his reputation as a pollster.
@Sam96Prior u really nd to contact ur local MP, these things are not done on a Party Political basis.  If you have any probs let me know :)
Great to be in Newark with @benhouchen and others, really positive response on the doors!
@benzoeverending should have said hi :). Thanks!  Appreciate msg.
@JohnFromBoro I believe it is being done, the Act allows for it so now the regulations just need implementing, so yes you can.
@JohnFromBoro @lodgersleft it's already being done, just not there yet: https://t.co/mlU4UDhRVk

Today Labour are pushing a policy that would increase rents. Many people I represent cannot afford to pay more.  http://t.co/sfLfCGaGyh
In committee dealing with the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme.  Now generating significant amounts of heat energy.
@RiversideRed_ been looked at and we recently got a Teesside city deal from govt to work together in some areas. Likely to be signed June.
.@andrewpercy That's interesting, so they have just sent standard letters from a national campaign.  Oh dear!
@keithduffell Hi Keith, fair enough if thats the case, but my email does automatically ask for an address and she didnt send one.
My Labour opponent has written to me about rent policy and copied her letter to the media. Here is my reply. http://t.co/Bq8yt138Xa
I know and rather like John, we do not always agree but he certainly speaks his mind! http://t.co/Oq6lWFAhwU
@hjoneshojo good point well made.  I'll leave it there :)
.@hjoneshojo poor @cllrharrington can't play nice even over Eurovision, our most complained about local Cllr for a reason #standards
@cllrharrington haha, no, though I hope Ukraine beats Russia whatever else happens.
@cllrharrington I want a referendum, it should for people to decide if they want us to leave or not. Please don't misrepresent my position.
In #Thornaby with a large group of residents to discuss problems with housing. http://t.co/rGZv6w8i40

This morning I visited NPower in #Thornaby to talk to staff and managers about changes there and support being given to leavers.
Just got back from a packed residents meeting in Hartburn, lots of concern about the way @stocktoncouncil is treating them!
@ToryTottyOnline send me an email and I'll explain cobbles in full, bit complex for a tweet :)
“Parroting Ed's party line from HQ gets you absolutely nowhere on the doorstep." -Labour candidate for the nxt election, theyve got a point!
Just been shown Labours latest Party Political Broadcast, it's amazing.  Childish rubbish devoid of policy, not a party ready for govt!
Under this govt the gender pay gap has fallen every year and been almost eliminated for full time workers under 40.  Lots done, more to do.
@kevin_nicholas5 small team!
Well done to everyone who came out campaigning today- loads done!  Now I'm off to Durham to speak at a dinner this evening :)
Out campaigning for the excellent NE @conservatives team for the Euro elections this afternoon with @BenHouchen http://t.co/Wwajib8txC
What is happening in Wales shows Labour can't be trusted on the NHS http://t.co/WytbNcS3tt
@DenisButler @enterprisecares happy to look at, please email details to me and I'll see if I can help :)
@ha66ie at great cost!
Don't forget in #Yarm the 1st hrs parking is free + doesn't require a ticket! We wont let Labours charges wreck Yarm! http://t.co/xWxiSuArlg
Really enjoyed the #Stockton @Conservatives curry night in #Eaglescliffe tonight, brilliant turnout!
My surgery today is at Tesco #InglebyBarwick from 4-5 :)
Recorded a film for students from @srcinfo this morning then a good meeting with local FSB.

At Broadcasting House to record for Tuesday's @BBCr4today, they've been in #Stockton meeting residents this week to talk elections.
@KulganofCrydee @Conservatives maybe I should have said "yet another reason I'll be voting @Conservatives" :)
Phil is not a bad person, but this is ridiculous: http://t.co/QhtQvtDEXw I'll be voting @Conservatives
Tonight @stocktoncouncil Labour Cllrs voted against independent recommendations on allowances to ensure more cllrs get more of our money!
Great GDP growth figures today - our #longtermeconomicplan is delivering jobs and security for people across Teesside http://t.co/cLM7tyGqvw
@MissElliebelle then calm the rhetoric please, we are on the same side here- it's Labour on @stocktoncouncil doing this.
@MissElliebelle don't try and make it an election issue- it's not +I won't respond to that approach, Ill be doing I what's right regardless.
@MissElliebelle I am and will be staying in touch with then re what's happening but its an SBC decision at end of the day! As I've explained
Youth unemployment continutes to fall across #Stockton here is Labour @stocktoncouncil's own graph! #goodnews http://t.co/vYJ07fOzQS
Great to be in #Romford tonight supporting the excellent @AndrewRosindell at his St George's Celebration Supper! http://t.co/yZjM48xmT7
@Mrsthirsty1 on it, doing what I can :) already had discussion re one site.
@Mrsthirsty1 some progress, I've had to intervene with one of them to help, important we get them ASAP.
A badly out of context and misleading quote from "me" in the Echo/D&S, shame. http://t.co/6fBBqigmJ6
Today I hope people in #Yarm vote Yarm Residents Association for the Town Council- good local people I can work with for the town :)
@kierondavis I question them all the time in fairness- can't win, some say I qu and criticise too much, some too little!
@kierondavis afraid not true tho, #Stockton running a £7.5m surplus this year (yes, really).
In #Stockton we are all paying more in Council Tax than we should because of Labour #costofliving http://t.co/cqJd7YTktM
#Stockton getting LED lights over the next few years, I hope (+suspect) this isnt true: http://t.co/E6mhmALxgU will keep an eye on it!
@mrgarethm @ScottWood29 not sure, claims to rent in Teesside, paid £20k to be Liverpool Cllr, go figure. A Labour activist said #nointegrity
.@ScottWood29 careful, when my Labour opponent  (Liverpool Cllr on £20k) argues with people online at night she often gets into trouble!
.@kevin_nicholas5 lest we forget what Labour think of #Yarm http://t.co/ajmZZkFUAJ
.@SerchZarate23 #Eaglescliffe is a great place to raise a family http://t.co/Vy1wxTxtUK
@Chewies_Dad sorry to hear this but it's your vote- I'll stand on my record and people will decide :)
@opusdeath @RobMeakin she isn't affiliated but would be a great choice- I'm backing her.
Walking down to #Yarm and this is up.  Very disappointing, Labour's Parking Tax will hit trade and residents hard. http://t.co/3nrtRKcdza
Unemployment in #Stockton South 538 lower than March 13 and 55 lower than in Feb, our #LongTermEconomicPlan is delivering work for Teesside.
@mikemcgrother @1245sunflowers I think it's a great idea. Happy to help if I can.
Quick off the mark @EveningGazette already got an article online about #Stockton and Benefits St. We don't want it! http://t.co/mn4RuoHlVa
Sat in Cultures Cafe in #Stockton with @ITVtynetees to discuss worrying news Benefits St might be coming to our town. #notwanted
@Jayneydup haha it's unadopted so a special case!
@Connorfield56 @ToryChairman @Conservatives it's an unadopted road, problem dates back many years.
Pot holes filled as far as the eye can see!  Thanks @stocktoncouncil 4 materials + #Eaglescliffe @conservatives http://t.co/CdIzmDd2NP
Out in #Eaglescliffe with the local @conservatives team filling potholes on Railway Terrace http://t.co/6XrP1S2mth
We cancelled Labours duty rises: petrol is 20p less than they planned, helps drivers + economy http://t.co/QU7UXScFub http://t.co/8KVXvHiwPZ
Mum of @wallaceme doing brilliantly on NE Sunday Politics!
#Ukraine has dropped from the headlines recently, whats happening there still worrying and important. George is right http://t.co/7ZHTH7oz8g
@lucymccartney26 I really hope this is not true!
Official opening of the external coffee shop at HMP Kirklevington Grange http://t.co/TshTc0nCec
A lovely day at #Eaglescliffe station as I wait to pick up the Justice Secretary to visit HMP Kirklevington Gange http://t.co/SbzGhaTsKN
@eyespymp there isn't a first class carriage on this train!
Great news that Teesside is punching above its weight with 11 NE companies securing RGF cash- jobs now and for the future for local people.
Just about to go on @BBCTees about #Yarm Police station
Congratulations to @sajidjavid a superb appointment to the Cabinet.
@dhm17 really? Any evidence? #Stockton South hasn't.  We need it lower but it's certainly not worst.
IMF upgrades UK growth to highest in G7, more jobs, pay and opportunities for Teesside people, our long #LongTermEconomicPlan is working
Closing #Yarm police station saving £18747 pa, less than half cost of Commissioners new chief of staff! No consultation #labourhateyarm
Police Commissioner at #Yarm Town Council saying police station to close with weekly surgery in library instead! Labour really hate #Yarm
@PaulBrandITV not one v other, just different, work together when in interests + respecting different economies eg Teesside/Yorkshire link
@WIHarrison @InglebyManor assume down to the unseemly row last night inc threats of media, screenshots, silly over reaction by some etc
@prowling92 sry to disappoint bt nothing to do with me, at all. First saw when tweeted at me last night. Ur candidate nds to get a grip tho!
Someone shd really take the Labour candidate against me off twitter, she had another embarrassing late night row, this time with a school!
Delighted to welcome @InglebyManor to twitter, will be a superb and much needed new secondary school in #InglebyBarwick proud to support it.
@manderson1979 @stocktoncouncil let's see if they respond... People aren't happy, Labour Council ignore the wishes of Yarm residents again.
@manderson1979 tell @stocktoncouncil that! There is a campaign to get them to see sense. Its not all of them just around town hall, still...
@manderson1979 some are around the Town Hall- it's @stocktoncouncil and lots of people are v upset!
An interesting tour of the Gateway Centre in Middlesbrough. Surgery tonight is at #Yarm library 4.30-5.30.
Really good q&a at @StocktonSFC, great that they secured an impressive "Good" Ofsted recently as well!
A good meeting with @stocktoncouncil first thing and now off to @StocktonSFC to meet students.
Local Lab stalwart @TerryFBH is upset my Labour opponent claims to live in #Stockton but takes circa £20k a year as a Liverpool Cllr #messy
@beckycenglish I know, I met residents last week and am having a surgery in Yarm tomorrow, @stocktoncouncil is causing a lot of upset.
@beckycenglish been a member for ages :) only get chance to post rarely tho.
This morning I was at ITV to record Around The House for this evening, now on my way back up to #Stockton :)
@jamieyoudale @alibrownlee @BBCTees born in North Tees Hospital and brought up in Teesside my whole life, mate.
Just been chatting to @alibrownlee on  @BBCTees about our local identity: Teesside, Cleveland, N Yorks, Durham, Tees Valley... Hmm.
Sitting in for an excellent speech by @Simonhartmp on the Wales Bill.
The Government is taking action to tackle nuisance/sales calls, good news and about time!  Well done @DCMS http://t.co/wVvsBslAya
@LeanderWinden oh honestly, it's not unusual.  You are reading far too much into it- google it you like. Thanks for feedback tho.

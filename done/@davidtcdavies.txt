@daithemusicman thats great. I am sure you would agree that everyone else should have the same - including the 400000 on a waiting list Thu Mar 12 16:27:05 GMT 2015
@postie802 but there is an nhs in England and the budget wasnt cut. In Wales it was cut by Welsh Labour Thu Mar 12 15:17:40 GMT 2015
@postie802 well perhaps tuen we could agree that the 8% funding cut imposed by WelshLabour on the Welsh NHS was a mistake Thu Mar 12 14:16:06 GMT 2015
@postie802 im not willing to accept 2nd rate excuses for a second rate service. 18 week wait is better than 26 week wait Thu Mar 12 14:09:57 GMT 2015
@postie802 ive got nothing but praise for the staff, just dont see why we should have to wait so longer than English to be treated Thu Mar 12 14:05:38 GMT 2015
@postie802 dont know your case buy if u want me to take it up and u r a constituent drop an email Thu Mar 12 14:02:27 GMT 2015
@daithemusicman im sure you were treated well - once you were seen Thu Mar 12 13:57:44 GMT 2015
@postie802 18 week wait for treatment (England) is better than a 26 week wait (Wales) Thu Mar 12 13:56:48 GMT 2015

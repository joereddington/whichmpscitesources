@JosephLCox yes id be happy to write to clls in gwent and ask them to support it.
@JosephLCox my opinion is that its a pity the other Gwent clls refused to support it. Looks like u didnt ask them in your rush to attack MCC
@JosephLCox pity u didnt ask 4 support from Labour Gwent clls last year. Its called Gwent Theatre not Monmouthshire Theatre.
@JosephLCox any idea why Labour controlled clls in Gwent wudnt support Gwent theatre??

@SE25A no you wont answer the simple question - what would be a proportionate response to 2000 rocket attacks?
Shale : Greens should be honest and admit they not against CO2 - they are against any kind of industrial development.
gas fired power stations vital to support wind industry and balance grid & half the CO2 of coal. Crazy that greens wont support shale gas.

@Rob_Merrick 1. Needs none of the subsidies which r upping bills now. 2 its already cut fuel bills in the US.
More renewables=more fuel poverty, fracked gas=cheaper fuel bills& less fuel poverty. Church please take note. Stop trying to have&eat cake

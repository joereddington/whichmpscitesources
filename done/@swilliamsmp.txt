Unemployment in Bristol West fell by over 1,000 over the last year. A thousand extra pay packets,with less tax taken off,thanks to @LibDems
@HulbertMathew @GreenRobTelford @DaveEtches It is - see section 2.7 of pre manifesto being debated at Autumn conference next month.
@GreenRobTelford @DaveEtches er, we've raised minimum wage and put in place new sanctions on non compliant employers.
@jdportes Well perhaps you should publicly tell the @TheEconomist they are wrong. I was quoting a trusted source.
@GreenRobTelford threshold for paying tax has been raised from £6,500 to £10,000 so it has obviously increased take home pay.
Here's data table of unemployment and other economic factors. British unemployment rate now 6.2% http://t.co/lHMJfglJJL
@GreenRobTelford curious that Green Party thinks jobs unimportant! As to pay, Lib Dems have raised tax threshold, increasing pay by >£700
Unemployment falls again, to 6.2% of the workforce. This is lower than Germany and all other major European economies.
@TheEconomist it's also a fantastic film, greatly enjoyed by this gay son and grandson of South Wales miners.

Long day Bristol-London-Bristol, now having dinner with @CllrChrisMartin @alex_mjs @WillCi8
@RoyalMail no, this is HOPEFULLY the only one. Inconvenient and expensive error by you for my constituent.
@RachelGoodchild @RoyalMail That makes it worse...being incorrectly  charged for a free letter, delivered 4 months late. Appalling.
@RachelGoodchild @RoyalMail You've done this in the public domain, I assume RM read twitter complaints! It's a very serious balls up by them
@RachelGoodchild @RoyalMail The same letter was delivered to about 40,000 people four months ago. The error is by Royal Mail, not me.
@BenSummerskill @LibDems Overarching principle yes. But we've been making case for more safeguards all way through.
@RachelGoodchild It's very clearly (from the picture) a major error by @royalmail - there is a ZERO charge for European Election mail.
I supported today's vote to protect the disabled, and tenants with no alternative housing offer, from reduction in housing benefit.
@RachelGoodchild All my letters are in Royal Mail pre franked envelopes so don't know how that could happen. Have you phoned my office?
In Parliament today to support my @LibDems colleague @AndrewGeorgeLD Bill to reform housing benefit

Eid Mubarak. Wishing all my Muslim friends and constituents a joyous day.
@keithhallam a half hour weekly pantomime is not scrutiny. Fewer, longer sessions would be better, interspersed by select cttee chairs.
@SteveSmith98 because it's good pantomime. But it's utterly useless parliamentary scrutiny...
@alex_bradbrook did you read what I've actually been saying for the last week or did you just assume there was "silence"??
@DavidRMock @GeorgeFergusonx I think scrutiny is even more vital for directly elected Mayors, such is the concentration of power.
@HulbertMathew I'm suggesting a more productive hour long session for chamber. Would leave more time for select cttee chairs sessions.
A better reform of PMQs would be making it monthly, for an hour, like govt departments. Current format is awful display of bad behaviour.

@NickyMorgan01 is so wrong : choosing art at school made my Dad an architect and my sister a job in fashion. So much for #marchofthemakers
Young people describe #FutureinMaking craft skills work + manifesto.
Labour is 5pc ahead of Tories in the marginals , so its not just that #webackEd : people desperately need a #Labour Government.

If Manzoni doesn't see why he shouldn't do a part time job for the drinks industry he's not fit to be CEO of civil service. @AndyBurnham
There are so many things wrong with civil service CEO also woRking part time for a drinks company- conflict of interest:breach of neutrality

DCMS have spent only 24m out of 300m on improving access- a terrible failure in delivery, but still claim its "marvelous" #outoftouch. 2/2
Extraordinary performance by DCMS ministers today- a doz MPs from Scotland to Isle of Wight complaining about Mobile and broadband 1/2
Great to be in the Imperial War Museum for #Labour Women's Dinner!
Devastating blow by @Ed_Miliband at PMQs- Govt Minister wants to pay #disabled 2 pounds an hour+ Cam has no answer.
@bphillipsonMP opening an important debate on transport in North East- roads,buses,airports even potholes a problem.
Once again @GordonBrown making a brilliant speech on constitution showing how destructive PM has been since #indyref. Hague looks unhappy.
Marvelous to vote for historic motion to recognise #Palestine + huge majority in favour.
Q:why is JacobReesMogg calling for a pact with UKIP? A:because he has a tiny majority over #Labour !
Mike Leigh's Mr Turner is visually an absolutely stunning film. Thx to C4.
@dansabbagh quite Wycliffe's heyday was 1380s and @JustinForsythdescribed Carswell's speech as modernising! #itsallrelative
Very pleased to go to Nat Portait Gallery and see William Morris exhib opening soon:if you r in Sunderland pop along to Portait Awards there
I shall be voting FOR recognition of #Palestine on Monday + proud to do so. #timeforchange.
I wonder if #Clacton result will bring more #Tory defections?
@JGForsyth if Wycliffe is modernising!?!
Odd really- same person elected means seismic change!
UKIP completely smashes Tories in Clacton- shows that people looking for change + coalition not delivering it.
Libs lost deposit in clacton!
Congratulations to @LMcInnes_Labour on winning in H+M tonight. Fall in Tory vote shows people lost trust in their capacity to bring change.
Spectacularly prejudicial picture of welfare state on C5"BenefitsBrits" with constantly sneering narrator + atypical group: eg no disabled!
I am @Booksaremybag great launch tonight for weekend celebrating BOOKS! http://t.co/C35lrYNpUp
As far as I can tell Tories trying to alienate all professionals- lawyers, doctors, teachers, librarians, architects even archaeologists!

Two good canvassing sessions in Evenwood this weekend for Council candidate Heather Smith #labourdoorstep .
Tuesday was late summer, today is early autumn, but still lovely.
Then a useful meeting at DCC on rollout of rural broadband esp in Teesdale.
Very good engagement event with 250 people for #Durham Health + Wellbeing. Lots of workshops on elderly and young peoples' needs.
Really sorry to see @Ofcom chief Ed Richards leaving- he's done a good job in a tricky environment.
Hilarious factoid of the week, courtesy of @MartinKettle- even 60pc of UKIP think #Tories too obsessed with EU!
@MichaelLCrick my canvass yesterday of "undecideds" in Heywood + Middleton was running at 7 to 1 for #Labour! @GrahamJones_MP
Suprised no one yet calculated just how much you have to earn to benefit from combined tax and benefit proposals from #Tories
National#POetry  Day in the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness #learnapoem and feel better :one for every mood! They f** you up  etc
I have to say views from Balfron Tower over London are stupendous!
Off to 130 Balfron Tower in Poplar- the latest #NationalTrust property is a former council flat from the 1960s!!
It seems to me that Cam's election strategy is a 25pc strategy!
Biggest threat to#NHS from #Tories is privatisation. If you care sign this petition now.http://t.co/dT3tvKIAVF
@faisalislam but the low income person loses it all from Osborne's in work benefit cuts!
So if we take together the benefits cuts to the working poor and the rise in tax allowance : people will be NO BETTER OFF at all!
I really can't see much for the NorthEast in Cam's speech.
Cam as a trade unionist really is rather hard to believe in.
Cam says a bigger tax cut of 1850 if you earn 50,000 than if you earn 12,500 where the cut is 500. Is that fair?
25 bn more cuts from Cam over 2 years. His tax cut is worth 500 so people would still be 1,100 worse off under the #Tories .
Cam just extended "youth" to 31. Big implications.
Cam says about #indyref it would have been wrong to "duck" the fight- but it was the Tories who were absent from the doorsteps!
Unbelievable: taken over 90mins to get to work on the bus. Time to find someone other than #Boris to run #TFL
I'm not sure about this Cam promise: shouldn't GPs, nurses,admin staff outside hospitals be allowed Sunday off-like shopworkers? #NHS
"@EmilyThornberry: Wow, Neil Taylor's Germany on @BBCRadio4 is fantastic!" BBC +British Museum collab'n 2 great institutions.
@christian_aid I am putting down a PQ to Dept for int devpt to ask what Govt is doing to avert S Sudan famine.
Chains, furlongs, hundredweight,gills quarts- your child could know all these under a new #Tory Government- PM's promise  #OutofTouch ???
Clear dividing lines between Tories and Labour now: we're for supporting those who work for a living ; they're for those who inherit wealth.
Even the FT say #Osborne wants to take 500 from 7m working poor! The nasty party is here, back, thriving!
@edvaizey bet your #FarrellReview meeting isn't as glamorous as #Lab14 ! @riba
@StampDutyReform have you heard of the #bedroomtax? The money has to be raised somehow!
"@BBCRichardMoss: .@RoryStewartUK says subsidy system needs to change to help small farms - helps those with 1,000 cows but not 60.YES!!
Nonsense that people with 2m houses can't pay a #Mansiontax- they can take out an annuity + leave their kids 1.8m instead of 2.1m -big deal!
Looking forward to campaigning for Labour in Rochester on 8 Oct following Reckless resignation!
Marvelous tweet of day @BBCR4 : an owl which I've lain awake listening to on holiday, but never before known which bird it was.
While at the same time lecturing poor people that they must take more cuts(like Sir Bob Kerslake) 2/2
Am I alone in being really tired of rich people saying they shouldn't be affected by austerity (like Kate Barker on Mansion tax) while 1/2
On my way to Parliament for important debate on how to stop ISIL in Iraq.

@Ed_Miliband making strong case for 8/hr + Marr not well briefed it would SAVE public money!
@matthancockmp we want to shift power from Westminster to our cities and regions: you seem to want MPs to still decide everything!
More I think about it more obvs it is :people want to shift power out of Westminster to Cities and Regions. #indyref fallout.
LOL #Tories angry at "backofafagpacket" promises to Scotland , so now errm, backofafagpacket new British Constitution!
Vernon Bogdanov really giving his former student David Cameron thumbs down on @r4 @BBC . Take a gamma boy!
"@LabourList: Change starts now, says @HarrietHarman http://t.co/DkV6mDOFpM" Good Piece.
@EchoPeterBarron I hope you will give evidence and ideas to UK Constitutional Convention @Ed_Miliband  has just announced.
Btw its no wonder the Tories love idea of an English parliament: they get 40pc of votes and 60pc of seats under FPTP!
@EdMiliband's proposal for a constitutional convention is far more statesmanlike and sensible than Cam's rush to judgement. Really good idea
Pm's approach to "english devolution" exactly as for EU referendum- party before country. #indyref fallout
@DianaJohnsonMP perhaps Hull citizens could tackle better with more power!
"@Independent: There is literally not a single woman in this iPhone 6 queue in London"// women have more sense!
Why did @edvaizey take no action on Tory Lincs libraries, but firm on Sheffield? @Rosiecosy http://t.co/L9UjYnT0JG
My views on devolution to Regions http://t.co/CbzuQvL0Ax following Scottish vote in #indyref
Pm is absurd: Scots spent 2 years debating before vote now he wants to cobble together English change in 3 months.
Why are media equating England with southern Tories? #indyref
PM making same mistake again- taking partisan approach to constitutional change. This why people get fed up with politics.
Thunderclap in London is it an #indref message from youknowwho?
Orkney virtually parish council numbers!
Clacks 54:46 spot on the Yougov poll.

My view of implications of #indyref -devolution to Regions esp North  http://t.co/qPmVSPIyIA @BBCPolitics @GrahamAllenMP
@GrahamAllenMP after #indyref we want real #Devolution to Regions @BBCPolitics.
John Redwood is so wrong on implications of #indyref - we want #Devolution to Regions not #Tory England! @northerntuc

@michael__price I did thank you and the band at the end was great! PRSCentenary
#Clegg's statement that EU commission should not be influenced by EU Parl shows he may be a Liberal but he is really not a Democrat at all.
@ChukaUmunna: Listening now to the incredible @swinglesingers at @PRSforMusic http://t.co/gJFBO8lxO7: followed by brill Fiona Bevan!
What have DCMS Ministers got to hide? They are only answering questions in Parliament ONCE in 4 months: May- September.
Will be on ITV's Round the House tonight talking about #Queen's Speech and recent elections.
Very good speech from @Ed_Miliband setting out what should have been in #Queen'sSpeech.
No commitment to legislate on Hague convention in #Queen's Speech which is disappointing.
Sir John Sorrell just presented brilliant vision for creative education to Warwick Commission's #futureofculture.
@Rdogggggggg order it at 8.45 and I'll be back to pay : usual rogan josh chicken korma etc

@PaulBrandITV and after my trip to cotherstone ( where PO is v good) I'm going for #Labour !!
"@VeraBaird: Poll shows Labour ahead of UKIP In Newark by-election." Good I'm going canvassing there tomorrow!!
@niborkm and don't you think this spate of prison escapes is related to prison service cuts too? #POA
@jon_trickett going abroad to protest innocence and ignorance is oldest trick in the book- remember John Major's teeth? #cablegate
Really looking forward to going to Cotherstone tomorrow morning- one of nicest villages in #Teesdale (errm I mean they're all really nice).
@CateGeorge69  been in Bishop 3/4 of time in past month- can't always tweet as signals so bad. Socialism's borders do not end at Durham!
@maryhoneyball congratulations on your well deserved re-election!
@sionsimon congratulations on your election and good luck- hope you won't be agreeing "coalition" with EPP!
@PaulBrannenNE I certainly hope the socialist group will NOT be forming a coalition with EPP- across EU people voting v orthodox austerity!
@Hugodixon thx , enjoying your analysis.
@Hugodixon interesting where can I see full european results not mediated by spin?
@Spetmologer I think you and others might come to regret that.
@DrEoinCl steinbeck,scott fitzgerald,miller, james, dickinson and now hemingway. Not even inc "to kill etc
@ashmcgregor and what about that Hannan guy for Tories in EP- quite pushy!!
@NickRobinson - don't be silly- no results from London or Scotland all votes in from English countryside!
@sturdyAlex yes silly me!
This bbc coloured map is just embarassing- they must think we are thick!
@sturdyAlex bbc also seem to have an american banker telling us about greek politics!
@Spetmologer and Ian Swales in Redcar??
Congrats to @Jude_KD @PaulBrannenNE. All your hard work for #Labour rewarded and commiserations to @JayneShotton also on the ticket.
Glad to have provked debate on Eng Lit, but must now concentrate on euro elections!
@DrEoinCl my favourite is War and Peace(in transl obvs!). But we want young people to get a love of reading AND understanding of own lit.
Congratulations to @Jude_KD and @PaulBrannen -hard work for #Labour has paid off - 2 good MEPS for North East.
@andrew_allison yes but we've doubled #Labour rep in North East and pushed out Tories and Libdems so it is a step forward.
@islaclarethomas quite- Keats +Eliot or Dickinson+Steinbeck??
NE region we've got 2 Labour MEPS :No Tory, No Libdem! Good improvement for #Labour
@tomcrackers errrm should learn languages (and do).anyway why so much americana what about the anglo-indians?
@tru it matters because as well as reading good books its a good idea to have a knowledge of your cultural history. Should do both.
@DrEoinCl yes but that's what happened that's why I said reforn not banning needed.
@tomcrackers good books in most languages, we should be more french about this :people can only rebel against a tradition if they know it!
@Rosiecosy yeah but Henry James, Scott Fitgerald why are they better than DHLawrence, Thomas Hardy, GrahamGreene,
Banning books is wrong but English curric needs reform: this year my child has read 6 US authors and no English- that can't be right.
@katygraham51 sorry, been out having a swim!
@Kevin_Maguire did you know Halfon's const assoc has had 35,000 from the CEO of a Ukrainian oligarch,arrested on FBI request re corruption?

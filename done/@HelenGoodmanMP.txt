In fact if people took up right to buy at current discount rates it will HALVE the funding for new build by housing associations. Tue Apr 14 21:29:34 BST 2015
Boris Johnson says right to buy means massive subsidies: so how and who will pay? The homeless and those on housing waiting lists. Tue Apr 14 21:22:27 BST 2015
Tory manifesto philosophy really is to those who have shall it be given and to those who have not shall it be taken away. Tue Apr 14 21:04:34 BST 2015

The more I think about Tory proposals to let some people inherit a million pounds  the more out of touch I think the Tories are #bedroomtax Sun Apr 12 19:05:40 BST 2015
There's something really vile about charging the #bedroomtax to poor disabled people and wanting to let others inherit 1 million homes. Sun Apr 12 19:04:00 BST 2015
And finally a million people heard this message "it was distributed to each as any had need": NOT hold onto as much u can+keep it in family! Sun Apr 12 14:28:02 BST 2015
It goes on "as many as owned land or houses sold them +brought the proceeds of what was sold" Acts 4:34 4/6 Sun Apr 12 14:24:29 BST 2015
George Osborne is right it IS about values but I prefer "there was not a needy person among them" Acts 4:34 read in church today 3/6 Sun Apr 12 14:22:41 BST 2015
Tories inheritance tax cut failed to take account of "everything they owned was in common" today's lesson in church from Acts 2/2 Sun Apr 12 14:20:28 BST 2015
When Tories planned inheritance cut day they ignored "no one claimed private ownership" -today's lesson in church from Acts. Sun Apr 12 14:18:59 BST 2015

Tories trying to divert attention- they're the ones cutting the defence budget and going back on their 2pc pledge which US has criticised. Fri Apr 10 13:23:36 BST 2015
Tory Fallon really over compensating for anxiety over Tory cuts to defence- an "unprotected" budget in their deficit reduction programme. Thu Apr 09 21:48:41 BST 2015

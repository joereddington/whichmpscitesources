@abdnhutchy is 130,000 fewer college places the EUs fault as well?
@abdnhutchy its amazing the nonsense you swallow from your party. You don't actually believe that fantasy...do you?
@abdnhutchy Aah the SNP myth machine kicks in. If it's illegal why have local government introduced it & the UK Parliament? #exposed?
@abdnhutchy we can have Â£8 per hour with a Labour Government next year, & can I remind the Scottish Government refused to introduce the LW!!
@abdnhutchy do I need to explain who won the 2010 General Election?
@abdnhutchy by voting Labour and getting rid of the Tories. I think I know where you're going here but Scotland voted NO.
@abdnhutchy how would it be a national minimum wage if you devolve it?
Pensions minister Steve Webb has just said pensions are not part of his departments budget, err, wrong.
SNP still arguing that the living wage breaches the law. No it doesn't. If it did get the cuffs out because local authorities are doing it.
@Arden_Forester yes.
I think our FM forgets the Tories kept the SNP gov afloat from 07-11 & next year if you vote Nat we'll get the Tories http://t.co/Hq0P6QfffF

At the start of living wage week we should remember the SNP refused to embody the LW into Scottish Government contracts.

Well BBCScotland you've covered yourself with something there but it's not glory. Poorly controlled debate,doubt it would have helped anyone
You've divided the country Alex, nobody else.
Why do Yes voters think Scotland is immune from paying bills and global economics. Separation will solve nothing.
Here we go - there's oil in the Clyde.
The world will not be a dangerous place in a separate Scotland.
Bring back Bernard Ponsonby.
Is Glen Campbell being paid for this?
Salmond has lost the plot
Has glen Campbell give for a pint?
Sad but this is a huge game for SNP
SNP have increased NHS spending in private sector.

And there will be even more children in poverty in a separate Scotland.
Glen Campbell had lost control.

@MrSammF @UK_Together website has all the details
I know you love them, here they are, tonight's stats from Westwood: 62% NO 38% YES.
Heading out on campaign trail - more stats later.
More mendacity on the news from @AlexNeilSNP, the man who put constituency interests before mental health patients interests in Lanarkshire.
The SNP will go large on NHS today but NHS is not an independence issue, it's been fully devolved since 1999. Yesperation?
#theSNP claim the NHS will be safe in their hands despite 37% rise in private healthcare
@rooney_kev they are allowed. Our campaign posters will be going up as well soon. Any help would be appreciated!

@SeumasG the internet.
@MrSammF @jmccabe09 @LindaFabianiSNP I have written to the chief executive of NHS Lanarkshire.
Tensions are clearly running high in the Yes camp,the personal abuse levels are increasing.
@allansayers  ???? you're blocked, bye
@LanarkshireBiz hi constituency office 01355 239642
@jmccabe09 this is terrible.
Judging by the some of the bizarre comments I'm getting on Facebook from Yessers it's fasten your seat-belts for the next four weeks or so.

@MrSammF sadly Sam it wouldn't.
When considering the latest Yes mendacity about the NHS; remember what doctors think about the NHS under SNP control. http://t.co/xak0EJ5w4j

Let me advertise this YES meeting with my old TROT adversary Gerry McMahon as speaker. Mossneuk Hall closed 5 yrs ago http://t.co/dbcqsgFJq6
@JohnJappy you should have a role on Yes Minister
Bank of England flatly denies Scottish currency talks - via @Telegraph http://t.co/tNn7RK7AgT - John Swinney joins the lying game.
Just finished another canvas session in Greenhills...57% NO - 43% YES.
Excellent article from Peter Jones in today's Times. http://t.co/gDQDdO4dag
If @JoanMcAlpine believes what she wrote in today's @Daily_Record about the Â£ she doesn't understand arithmetic, economics or history.
Tonight's numbers from Calderwood - 64.5% NO - 35.5% YES.
More time isn't helping @AlexSalmond
Jackie Bird coshing @AlexSalmond on NHS.
Watching @AlexSalmond telling lies live on BBC1.
Your nightly stats. In Greenhills tonight, 60% NO 40% YES
Latest odds from Ladbrokes NO 1/8 YES 5/1.
@relyian @YesScotland @GeorgeMax_ofs another spoof SNP account for casual abuse.
@GeorgeMax_ofs we already have control of the NHS through Holyrood.The SNP (& your) argument is 100% bogus. Your clutching at straws.
@YesScotland @GeorgeMax_ofs George, this is a deceitful argument. I thought better of you.

Cybernats are behaving like cornered, wounded animals. Has something happened?
@Pressuredrop @MonicaLennon7 @M_McMahon_MSP @HLSLabour absolutely.
@M_McMahon_MSP @MonicaLennon7 @HLSLabour just sharpening my horns and listening to Ozzy Osbourne backwards.
@M_McMahon_MSP @MonicaLennon7 @HLSLabour LOL
@mrjamesmack @stumurph whats hypothetical - there will be no currency union. For goodness sake man his own side think he's wrong. Bye.
@MonicaLennon7 @HLSLabour did Cllr Lee at no point think, maybe this isn't a good idea.
@mrjamesmack @stumurph Yes ain't going to win & my Party's position is clear. No currency union. What part of that answer do you not get?
@mrjamesmack @stumurph what on earth are you ranting about. We want to keep the pound and stay in UK with a strong Scottish Parliament.
@mrjamesmack @stumurph ????
@stumurph @mrjamesmack @YesScotland we don't need one.
@mrjamesmack @YesScotland you might as well ask me about driving on the other side of the road and aliens, it's not going to happen.
@Historywoman @VoiceFor_Reason @YesScotland indeed
@YesScotland stop lying to Scots. RUK won't share currency because of the connected liabilities.Your 'costs of exchange' argument is risible
@VoiceFor_Reason @Historywoman @YesScotland I've seen it all now, quoting Iain McWhirter as common sense.
@StrongerUnited1 @Historywoman @dazeythinker @hommer123 I'd just give that to the Police.
@SeumasG no.
I won't be answering Yes campaigners questions like, why is RBS a Scottish bank? And these are the ppl trying to change minds. Wow.
In Hamilton with United with Labour, fantastic response,ppl asking for NO leaflets.The focus is now on our country's future.#bettertogether
SNP currency union argument is transaction charges. Transaction charges = Â£500million; cost of underwriting Scottish banks = Â£1800 billion.

Darling Scores High With Style And Substance http://t.co/LVtmB01X9K
@SainsburysPR I will.
Just read @anneapplebaum IRON Curtain - The crushing of Eastern Europe. An excellent piece of work.
@NTSI_VoteNo @STVNews McWhirter conceding defeat.
@STVNews @NTSI_VoteNo Et tu, Brute?
@AJMackinnon thanks bye
@AJMackinnon @greggmcclymont indeed, but not a majority of votes - I don't have to explain that, do I?
@AJMackinnon @greggmcclymont may A majority is 50% + 1. The SNP didn't get a majority, sorry if that bursts your bubble.
Once again I didn't vote for you Alex.
@TogetherDarling you hit the back of the net every time. Well done, you did us proud.
Where are the jobs Alex?
Darling spot on - whatever UK offers Alex Salmond will offer more.
We are going to spend the oil money, save the oil money and pay off debt with the oil money. It's a miracle.
Oh oh, the English hating has started
Only England Alex.
Alistair Darling winning this by a country mile.
Pandas, outer space and driving on right hand side of road. High political debate? This is our First Minister. Embarrassing.
This is pathetic Salmond
Salmond: we leave the UK - but we'll keep the Â£. And the rUK will agree with our demands. So much for independence.
We leave UK - we leave the Â£ Alex
Suggested 1st ? to Alex- why did u lie to the Scottish people about EU legal advice?
The bad news is the cure for insomnia Pat Kane is in the spin room.
No they didn't
Whammy
Salmond playing the Tory card, majority of country didn't vote for SNP in 2011. Inconvenient truths.
No new arguments then Alex
100% record - 16 doors in a row - All NO
Preparing my candle for those I'll never know. 'For your tomorrow, We gave our Today'.
Great night in East Mains with #bettertogether - 70/30.
SNP use their majority in Holyrood and scrutiny committee to stop enquiry into their botched exam system. & they lecture us about democracy.
Very, very good closing ceremony.
Des Clarke - perfect choice.
Is this girl singing her whole album?
Clever stuff from the Aussies.

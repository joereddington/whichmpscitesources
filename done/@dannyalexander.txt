@1edmountain @mgrobb @drewhendrySNP @IslaOReilly 2/2 Looking into bus transport for pupils. We should encourage participation. Tue Apr 28 13:23:33 BST 2015
@1edmountain @mgrobb @drewhendrySNP @dannyalexander @IslaOReilly Already said I’m happy to facilitate the pupils getting to hustings 1/2 Tue Apr 28 13:21:48 BST 2015
.@Inverness_Royal pupils should be allowed to take part in FSB hustings in Nairn. @HighlandCouncil should think again http://t.co/0xyiYIX4jn Tue Apr 28 10:50:10 BST 2015
0.3% GDP is still progress but a warning too. Vital @LibDems in next govt to keep fair & balanced approach needed to secure this recovery Tue Apr 28 09:35:22 BST 2015
@KayleighMutch it was great to meet you... Mon Apr 27 18:29:50 BST 2015

'The deficit halved/ jobs up/growth up ...we won't let you or the Tories screw it up' My reply to @LiamByrneMP  note http://t.co/9r0CXOMQ2f Fri Apr 24 10:55:33 BST 2015
Today I release my response to the infamous 'there is no money' note from @LiamByrneMP @LibDems @LibDemPress http://t.co/OLSXCvSEvz Fri Apr 24 10:47:01 BST 2015
@CarolynCaddick @HighlandLibDems great to visit the Balmenach distillery today, and then a delicious lunch at the 2Ps cafe in Cromdale Hall Thu Apr 23 18:01:04 BST 2015
Second, the Tories pretend they can win outright majority. They can't. No poll or market report expects that. So they won't rule out Bluekip Thu Apr 23 08:57:00 BST 2015
First, the Tories won't stick to the coalition economic plan. They will lurch to be right, with excessive cuts, targetted at the poorest Thu Apr 23 08:54:02 BST 2015
Astonishing to hear @George_Osborne on @BBCr4today unchallenged on the two biggest Tory porkies of this election 1/3 Thu Apr 23 08:51:14 BST 2015
Great Q&A with @NorbordEurope at Dalcross - really interesting questions. Good warm up for @BBCRadioScot hustings http://t.co/Vs0bBFiGIg Wed Apr 22 18:53:52 BST 2015

@davidraven131 good to meet you at Simpson's today, congratulations again on your success on Sunday Mon Apr 20 16:02:30 BST 2015
I hope the SNP will explain today that their full fiscal autonomy plan requires more than £1bn in cuts in the north of Scotland every year Mon Apr 20 08:21:31 BST 2015

#LibDemsInGovt =Low inflation,Strong growth, Record employment.  Vital to keep @libdems hand on economic rudder & in heart of govt #GE2015 Tue Apr 14 09:30:01 BST 2015
Only @LibDems have set out a fully costed plan to deal with deficit & fund new policies. Labour & Tories making numbers up as they go along Mon Apr 13 16:41:05 BST 2015
@edballsmp are you still committed to debt falling as % of GDP in 2016/17, which you voted for? How will you find the £12bn savings needed? Mon Apr 13 14:56:15 BST 2015
@edstradling @afneil thanks ed! Sun Apr 12 14:09:48 BST 2015
@RobbieRockettt Hi Robbie, taxis are regulated by Highland Council but if you email danny@highlandlibdems.org.uk I can look into it for you Fri Apr 10 15:01:04 BST 2015
...and stopped in to see the superb Loch Ness brewery in Drumnadrochit too http://t.co/9tSSEMtFgY Thu Apr 09 20:35:52 BST 2015

As Nick Harvey said we can take a step down the ladder of disarmament with fewer submarines and maintain deterrence whenever needed Thu Apr 09 09:10:26 BST 2015
@libdems have set out a responsible, rational alternative drawing on the evidence in the Trident alternatives review Thu Apr 09 09:00:20 BST 2015
Michael Fallon offered not a single argument for the Tory position on Trident renewal in his pathetic @bbcr4today interview Thu Apr 09 08:58:08 BST 2015
Working people are seeing their income tax bills come down thanks to Highland Lib Dems - my article in today's P&J http://t.co/LrdjmHrVc8 Mon Apr 06 11:24:17 BST 2015
Increases in the personal allowance since 2010 are saving most workers £825 a year from today - keeping promise made in @LibDems manifesto Mon Apr 06 09:12:37 BST 2015
27 million working people are paying less income tax from today - @LibDems have ensured tax free allowance rises to £10,600 this year Mon Apr 06 09:10:07 BST 2015
@stellacreasy quite right, though Easter Sunday and your birthday would justify a full day off... Sun Apr 05 22:16:42 BST 2015
@stellacreasy happy birthday! Sun Apr 05 21:56:37 BST 2015
income tax personal allowance rises to £10,600 2moro -a tax cut of £825 a year for 27m people-only happening because @LibDems battled for it Sun Apr 05 13:09:20 BST 2015
Nick superb: challenging Milband on the economy, Farage on immigration, Cameron on cuts; only @LibDems can keep strong economy &fair society Thu Apr 02 22:02:08 BST 2015
People will remember that Ed Miliband refused to apologise for Labour's failed economic policies before 2010 Thu Apr 02 21:40:36 BST 2015
@LibDems @normanlamb it was indeed - and it is Nick Clegg who is putting better mental health services at the top of the agenda Thu Apr 02 21:00:31 BST 2015
Nick brilliant on NHS - only the Lib Dems have a plan for the £8bn the health service needs, and to invest in mental health #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:48:17 BST 2015
Nick Clegg v strong on economy: we need a balanced plan, @LibDems will borrow less than Labour, cut less than the Tories #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:38:38 BST 2015
Delighted to be the first candidate to be officially nominated with @HighElection for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency Wed Apr 01 13:43:36 BST 2015
A good day's campaigning in Culloden and Nairn. Looking forward to @InvernessChambr hustings tomorrow Tue Mar 31 23:07:39 BST 2015
Hi @NicolaSturgeon, heard your interview this morning. Full fiscal autonomy deserves full frank answers. When will £8bn of SNP cuts start? Tue Mar 31 13:17:16 BST 2015
Upward boost in Q4 #GDP & best business investment figures since 2007.  #LibDemsInGovt =rock of stability on which this recovery is growing Tue Mar 31 09:30:08 BST 2015
Heartless Tories and reckless nationalists wld both wreck recovery (as wld clueless Labour) only @scotlibdems can keep our recovery on track Tue Mar 31 08:50:55 BST 2015
Slippery i/vs from Cameron & Sturgeon: he won't spell out 12bn welfare cuts, she won't say when 8bn cuts from full fiscal autonomy start Tue Mar 31 08:50:49 BST 2015
A week today, the amount you earn before paying income tax rises to £10,600 - people are paying less tax because @LibDems made it happen Mon Mar 30 19:42:04 BST 2015
Spent the first day on the election campaign meeting voters in Nairn, and visited the brilliant Nairn museum too http://t.co/4eOFdXvlRF Mon Mar 30 19:37:33 BST 2015

@JimHunter22 LDs in minority done much for H&I, SNP majority centralised power, weakened local bodies & failed on Highland infrastructure
@JimHunter22 not querying yours either, far from it, but I think a stronger Scotland in UK brings the change u want, without risks of 'yes'
@JimHunter22 not true - you've read the Steel Commission, the Campbell Commission, seen calman delivered & guarantee of much more after 'no'
@JimHunter22 it's one vote away Jim, you know federalism is the right answer for Scotland in the UK - say 'no thanks' tomorrow to get it

Shocking that over £2.5 billion wiped off value of Scottish FTSE firms today - a hint of real cost of separation for jobs, pensions, growth
It's a shame @AlexSalmond forgot to bring any of the powers he has centralised on his brief visit to Inverness
@greendadtwit @KennyFarq don't agree Jason, the record of nationalists in govt hoovering power from communities to Edinburgh says otherwise
Scottish Lib Dem & Scottish Labour MPs voted in force today - shame SNP MPs couldn't be bothered
@KennyFarq the @scotlibdems campaign is all about more powers for a stronger Scotland - and reversing SNP centralisation within Scotland too
In London today to vote for Andrew George's Bill - delighted Parliament backed Lib Dem proposals to reform spare room subsidy policy
@KennyFarq you should have come to Inverness for my speech last Friday, spelling out why a federal UK is the best plan for Scotland
Labour's 1.43 pence per ltr #fuelduty rise would have kicked in today.  We cancelled this rise - longest freeze in 20 years @libdempress

@bbcweather @VisitCairngrms but bright sunshine today....
Scotland's defence industry employs thousands of people here because we are part of the UK #bbcindyref
Darling right Salmond refusing to give a straight answer on currency, on oil, on public services - SNP plans don't add up #bbcindyref
Darling right that key growth sectors for Scotland are all stronger in the UK - jobs and prosperity depend on staying together #bbcindyref
Salmond talking nonsense on the NHS again, Darling right to expose nationalist scare tactics #bbcindyref
Salmond now seems to be threatening to default on debt - would mean much higher interest rates for every family in Scotland #bbcindyref
Currency union isn't going to happen, Salmond dodging questions on Plan B yet again
Salmond blatantly ignores the fact that any realistic oil numbers leave a huge hole for an independent Scotland to fill #bbcindyref
Salmond quotes @oecd, this is their sec gen Angel Gurría: "The UK, Scotland and the world would be better off if the UK remains as one."
No thanks does not mean no change @TogetherDarling rightly says
@FraserNelson it's bright sunshine in the Highlands today, not too bad in Glasgow this evening either

Alex Salmond is closing his eyes on currency and hoping reality will go away - my Scotsman piece http://t.co/p73wmIAcaW
Salmond dismisses IFS, OBR and others, because he can't admit that public spending higher in Scotland because of place in UK #scotdecides
Salmond misleading claims that Scotland is net contributor to UK, yet SG figures show Scotland deficit higher than UK last year #scotdecides
Pensions safer in UK - no cross border costs for private pensions; and broad shoulders of UK mean more affordable state pension #scotdecides
Darling won that hands down, the right questions, the strongest arguments for the UK - Salmond's bluff and bluster no match #ScotDecides
Now Salmond tries to take credit for triple lock - a Lib Dem policy delivered by us in government. Extraordinary! #ScotDecides
Swinney legally obliged to balance the books, so hardly an achievement, we have £1400 more per person for public services in UK #ScotDecides
Salmond talking nonsense on public finances - Scotland's deficit bigger than UK, facts are here #scotdecides https://t.co/uEOEDy6k6c
Darling's currency questions on the money - there won't be a currency union so Scots need to hear what plan B is #ScotDecides
Salmond clearly has no interest in answering serious questions about the risks and dangers of separation #ScotDecides
Fantastic cross questioning by @TogetherDarling on currency - Salmond knows there won't be a currency union, but refuses to spell out plan B
Let's hope @kennymacaskill is planning to announce a change of heart on armed police patrolling the Highlands in a few minutes
Angel Gurría, sec gen of @OECD, hits the nail on the head: "The UK, Scotland and the world would be better off if the UK remains as one.”

Early morning Easyjet flight from Inverness to London packed again today
brilliant day out at @LandmarkParkUK today, great fun for kids...and grown ups too!
@stackee I am sure it's our income tax cuts coming tomorrow they really like
£10,000 income tax threshold only happening because Lib Dems forced it onto the agenda #strongereconomy
Lib Dem income tax cuts are helping job creation and growth - we have fastest growing economy in G7 and fastest rising tax threshold too
Our tax free threshold has rise by over 50% since 2010, 5 times more than any other G7 country, thanks to Lib Dems http://t.co/m2XtQtUULc
Thanks to the Liberal Democrats, Britain now has the largest tax free threshold for working people in the G7 http://t.co/CVpUeYWsPh

@moneyforlifeuk @Lisa_Smart @wallet_watchers #mflc many congratulations, deserved success for a brilliant group
On the day of #NickvNigel @SMMT report concludes that ‘OUT’ would harm UK car industry that supports 700,000 UK jobs
Delighted to attend launch of major @SMMT report ‘UK Auto Industry & the EU'–concludes that UK must stay ‘IN’ for UK car industry to prosper
Last month John Swinney said I was scaremongering on pensions. Now EC confirms all I said. Looks like Swinney is the one caught 'red handed'
Nick is right that over 3 million British jobs are linked to trade with Europe - we shouldn't put a single one of those jobs at risk
Farage says cars from rest of EU are better quality than those made in UK - he's wrong, we are the best place in Europe for that industry
I agree with Nick - Britain is better off IN Europe #NickvNigel #iagreewithNick  http://t.co/VdzT57YYMX
@SusanGaszczak thanks!

@Trishamac07 I voted to strengthen the bank levy to ensure continues to raise serious money from banks. Labour opposition to this bizarre.
@iam_kayti thanks
@kfreel @labour yes, by voting against the budget they also voted against Lib Dem tax cuts for 25 million working people
By voting against the Budget tonight, Labour voted against coalition's great liberal pensions reform, completing a week of flip-flops
Inflation falls to 1.7% in Feb – another sign that our long term plan is working.  Eases the pressure on family budgets #strongereconomy

It’s time to deal with David Cameron’s cost of living crisis. Let’s freeze gas and electricity bills. #freezethatbill http://t.co/zXiutEQRBw
Saddened to hear of death of John Cole - he was an impressive broadcaster, and wrote a fascinating account of his life reporting politics.
@B4bs73 yes - it was lovely to meet you. Hope to see you again.
Great to have Ed Miliband here in Glasgow this evening for the Scottish Labour Party Gala Dinner.

@BBCDouglasF I think it was a case of tough on prize winning and tough on the causes of prize winning. #katiemorag
Instant judgement seems to be that Katie Morag on #cBeebies lived up to (v. high) expectations! #stillwaitingforthearrivalofthebigboycousins
Essential viewing for all families (like mine) that love the books & the Hebrides: The new Katie Morag TV series is on #cBeebies @ 5.25pm
You can listen to Choral Evensong from Paisley Abbey now on BBC Radio 3.  #positivepaisley #850thanniversary

Congratulations to @cara_hilton. A strong result for @scottishlabour. Now Dunfermline has an MSP who'll fight for them in Holyrood.
@mrcridgemodstud Thanks for taking the time to tweet me questions- hope answers helpful.
@mrcridgemodstud I’m very lucky to have a job that is so diverse that it is genuinely interesting.
@mrcridgemodstud Opposition is frustrating when you see government policies damaging our community.
@mrcridgemodstud Representing the area I grew up. I get huge satisfaction from being able to help local people.
@mrcridgemodstud Top priority is cost of living crisis. Work closely with local groups, eg setting up foodbank + my loan sharks campaign.
@mrcridgemodstud This week issue is closure of BASF plant. I'm visiting the site tomorrow. V difficult for workforce + local economy.
Good luck to @cara_hilton in #Dunfermline today. Dunfermline deserves better: an MSP to fight to reduce bills and protect town centre.

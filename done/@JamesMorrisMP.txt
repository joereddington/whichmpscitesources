@DeanPerks I voted for a referendum in October 2011 and will keep on voting for one.
@joe_peacock ok no problem.
@katherinemrohan Yes was in the debate. Absolutely agree with you. It ia an area we need to get right across the board.
@joe_peacock if you have specific questions email me.
@lethal_weapon do you have 'exceptional circumstances' which need to be taken into account. Email me if you have.
Taking more evidence on the challenges of the private rented sector @CommonsCLG.
@MrXeis If this was a 'call' then no I don't. GP's should be offering more appointments as a means of releiving pressure on A&E.
@MrXeis Not typical in terms of scale but patient care too variable across NHS.
@TheDanWatson What isn't?
@MrXeis  So you think throwing more money at the system will mean no more patient care scandals like Mid Staffs?
@MrXeis We are not. NHS reforms designed to improve patient care.
@MrXeis I agree we have a good health care system in the NHS but ageing population and technology mean reform necessary.
@MrXeis Your point being?
Out and about with some members of MP Action team in Cherry Street #Halesowen. Managed not to get too wet. http://t.co/jqnKr8DtlG
@KayFSheldon @PaulJRethink @NickyMorgan01  Yep totally agree.
@KayFSheldon Are you part of an existing patient group. If so why don't you send details to http://t.co/Jp86kPqnxg@parliament.uk.
@KayFSheldon @PaulJRethink @NickyMorgan01 Always interested in pt views.
@KayFSheldon @PaulJRethink @NickyMorgan01 Agree that policy decisons can often be poor without patient input.
Thanks to Centre for Mental Health for hosting such a stimulating discussion on #mentalhealth today. Many good ideas to take forward.
@PaulJRethink @NickyMorgan01 Thanks for your contribution.
@KayFSheldon @PaulJRethink @NickyMorgan01 We do.
@MrXeis Not sure this is an entirely balanced piece.
@Rebeca_Crowtheri If you could send to http://t.co/Jp86kPqnxg@parliament.uk that would be great.
@Rebeca_Crowther Have written to Dudley Council asking if they can prioritise Halesowen. If you can send photo of bad examples would help.
Very good turnout so far for today's Apprenticeship & Skills Fair at Zion Centre in Halesowen. More than 200 vacancies here until 3pm
@terrieynon @NickyMorgan01 @GregBarkerMP Agree with you about who sees mental health. No one suggesting long therapy is the only answer.
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Not wrong just too narrow
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Many mental health experts across the piece think that NICE guidelines need to be looked at.
@leonc1963  That would be great, Thanks!
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Yes outcome measures exisit but they are very narrowly defined.
@leonc1963 Please send further details of post stroke challenges to http://t.co/Jp86kPqnxg@parliament.uk.
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Would have to be independently assessed and verified but we need to move beyond NICE guidelines
@MrXeis You think utilities should be renationalised?
@leonc1963 @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Not sure I understand your point?Are you refering to post stroke care?
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 Of course outcomes are important. We need more sophisticated ways of measuring them.
@terrieynon @GregBarkerMP @NickyMorgan01 I am not 'promoting' anything just suggesting that we need more choice of therapies on NHS.
Why mental health matters in the opportunity society.
http://t.co/mOmQHOgkic
@Nick4125 not sure. Will investigate.
@RealKatieWiddop Ok didn't realise that.
@RealKatieWiddop I was thinking of the one that damaged your car. You need help in getting compensation?
@andyvilla75 Yep understand the issue. Will raise with Chief Exec of Trust when I next meet with here,
@RealKatieWiddop Chasing up to see how Council is prioritising repair work. Is the hole still there on Mucklow Hill?
@RealKatieWiddop yes I was at funeral and no I'm not.
@Pyrokiter Wasn't Eric Varley a Labour Cabinet Minister? Bit much to blame Margaret Thatcher for decisons taken by Wilson govt.
@Pyrokiter In the long run having uncompetitive and unproductive companies is a disaster for any economy.
@Pyrokiter There is a big difference between support and propping up.
@Pyrokiter There were a lot of very uncompetitive manufacturing companies around in the 1970s. Should government have just propped them up?
@covas_corax Need to have different potential entry points for more mature people with outside experience
@Pyrokiter Not sure what you mean. Privatises state? Are you suggesting the state shouldstill manage who has a telephone?
@Talliscat Can you email me with details of the campaign to http://t.co/Jp86kPqnxg@parliament.uk
Excellent speech from John Redwood summarising legacy of Baroness Thatcher.
Just arrived back in Parliament ahead of the tributes debate to Baroness Thatcher.
Very sorry to hear of death of Baroness Thatcher. She will be greatly missed. Thoughts with her close family and friends.

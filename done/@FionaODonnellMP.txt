Scotland's journey to devolution took decades & involved civil society. @Ed_Miliband is right. Shotgun devolution would be wrong for England

@RiaDRobertson not happy that EU is lurching to right but don't want to walk away. Off to phone undecided voters. Going well. Bye
@RiaDRobertson come on. Answer my question. If it isn't democracy, what is it?
@RiaDRobertson I accept but sometimes don't like outcome of democratic elections within UK. You say it isn't democracy. What is it?
@RiaDRobertson what is it?
@RiaDRobertson in what way are Scottish and rUK MPs not equal?
@RiaDRobertson always welcome democracy but not necessarily outcomes. Don't you?
@RiaDRobertson Have more Scottish rep at Westminster than we would have in EU. Glad you agree with principle of ceding sov to work together
@RiaDRobertson Do you agree some decisions should be made at EU level rather than Scottish? I do and some at UK level
@RiaDRobertson try telling that to Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain.....Austerity forced by ECB
@RiaDRobertson surprised you want a currency union if you think that will happen.
Last night only Yes talked about Scotland being too wee, poor & stupid. We think we are big, smart & confident enough to be successful in UK
@Aibagawa thank you for allowing him to have his feelings
@Aibagawa he can feel that way but accept he has no right to vote.
@Aibagawa no. Didn't argue that at any point.
@Aibagawa that raised a chuckle.
@Aibagawa I agree he can't vote in referendum. There. Good night
@Aibagawa I don't understand what we might be disagreeing about.
@Aibagawa I accept the franchise for referendum. Expect there will be Scots in Sweden doing the same who would vote Yes
@Aibagawa there are Scots living elsewhere on both sides who are sorry they won't have a vote. May be politically active in their new homes
@Aibagawa and your problem with that?
@Aibagawa Just pleased he is making a difference there

@MclennanPaul @EastLothianCLP @robertmcneill2 We are campaigning with confidence & pride. People we spoke to last night don't agree with you
Lovely evening of campaigning last night in Prestonpans with 2:1 saying #nothanks
@ScottishParent thanks. Lovely to meet you #notacoldcaller

@StephenDickson8 @stephenboydstuc @JimMcCormick16 can we be members of EU without central bank or would we need to join Euro?
@Ross_Greer so it's an SNP manifesto paid for by our taxes
@Ross_Greer so not voting for reducing corp tax. Follows not voting for more childcare either, or currency union.... What is point of WP?
@blairmcdougall on Friday in @PrestonLodgeHS debate @BlairJenkinsYes said 3% reduction in corp tax may or may not happen. #bettertogether

Read @GordonAikman in Telegraph.His campaign is reaching top of government & across the globe http://t.co/hpFhwOFB3q #MNDIceBucketChallenge
joy to door knock in Pans-60% for No. Nobody had good word to say about @AlexSalmond in debate "He came out from lectern, I switched off"
@EmmaLMusic oboist and bassoonist. Almost a full wind section
@AlexSalmond don't need to wait until after the general election for powers to create jobs.2012 Scotland Act gives more borrowing powers
@AlexSalmond talks about poverty wages. He wouldn't vote for living wage in procurement bill #bbcindyref
It is not inevitable because a gov is in Westminster child poverty will increase. Labour halved child poverty #bbcindyref
It's the price of a Tory led government. How much have the SNP stripped away from anti poverty prog & colleges #bbcindyref
So you can save Fergusons because Scotland voted for devolution & Labour delivered it #bestofbothworlds
@EmmaLMusic email me if you want to help with campaign. Can chat about my two musician sons
@AlexSalmond reminds me of playground bullies who thought shouting aah aah while you were speaking equates to winning
Brilliant ? from @GlennBBC to @AlexSalmond why wasn't threat to NHS in white paper. Cos Yes in last ditch attempt to win women's votes
@EmmaLMusic hope you will be back home to vote
@AlexSalmond coming over all gallous & arrogant. The mask slips again #bbcindyref
@AlexSalmond asks us to settle for second best on the currency. We can all have our first choice by voting No #ScotlandDecides
And here it comes, the currency.Walk downstage & appear trustworthy. It isn't working for @AlexSalmond & it won't work for Scotland
Talking of empty barrels, @AlexSalmond not citing oil revenue to government but wealth that goes overseas #ScotlandDecides
@GrinBins @Macnessie Yes sees inconvenient questions & truths as scaremongering #NoThanks
@firstyin there is no point in conversing with someone who thinks I lie. Good night and good bye
@firstyin nothing to do with being an MP. I have believed we are stronger together all my life. Not about self interest but common interest
@Happy_Appetite We have to pull together regardless of outcome. That is how we all show just how much we love our country #indyref
@firstyin @IainGrayMSP @Shaminakhtar @parkhead01 not cowards. They believe it is best for their families & Scotland.

@Aibagawa currency union and Euro off table. Salmond so left with own currency or sterlingisation. Which of these is plan B?
Guardian/iCM poll deservedly shows @TogetherDarling winning last night's debate. So proud to have him leading our campaign #bettertogether
Received my glossy Scotland's future document in the post today. Still no Plan B for currency #indyref #LabourNo
All the training to stop Alex Salmond looking smug has worn off already #indyref #LabourNo

@epaul911 people in Prestonpans smarter than you give them credit for. They were enthusiastically & unequivocally saying No to independence
@epaul911 not sure what you mean by that? There was a team of volunteers for #UnitedWithLabour
@epaul911 didn't manage to speak to thousands this pm. Well over 50% said #nothanks
Ok. Nobody likes a show off so I will just say lots of people saying #nothanks in Prestonpans this afternoon #UnitedWithLabour

@davali8668 @YesEastLothian are you accusing me of lying? Those are the figures from today. Sunday was even better for #nothanks
@Ind3pendent7 @MclennanPaul @georgegalloway it is possible to want to see back of coalition gov and vote No

@evil_del have already and more dates to come in Tranent and Musselburgh
@evil_del I am not undecided but might come along. Is this @YesEastLothian or @labourforindy meeting?
Debate on protecting children In conflict has not been short on quality. Thanks to @grahamemorris @JeremyLefroyMP @EdwardLeighMP so far
@JeremyLefroyMP gives message of hope for children who have been recruited into armed groups
Powerful speech from @grahamemorris speaking up for Palestinian children in detention

@gavincrowden thanks, Gavin, and for @WorldVisionUK briefing. Will ref your recommendations on supporting child soldiers
@YesEastLothian following Electoral Comm response to my complaint are you registering cost of leaflet with no imprint with @YesScotland?

@calummiller @robertmcneill2 of course I do, Calum
Pleased to have the opportunity last night to praise @BridgesProject1 in Parliament last night
Belter of a speech from @AnneMcGuireMP attacking this gov's record on delivering welfare reform. Lord I will miss her
@bmc875 name anything I claimed for that was unreasonable? Just got my act together in setting up office quickly. Where do I rank now?
@Yes_Dunbar guess what. I don't
@bmc875 are you claiming you know me, my motivation and my character?
@Yes_Dunbar in an independence ref did you ever think Labour and Tories would not be arguing for same result?
@bmc875 not my thought process or my purpose. Please don't judge me when you don't know me
@STARBRIGHT164 @hoohimthetim I am blocking anyone who uses abusive language. Removing a vowel does not remove the offence. Goodbye
@bmc875 you can do better than that, Brian
Looking at some of the tweets from @tangotony I feel physically sick. Surely you can make the case without posting abuse
@bmc875 In my experience, bookies get it right & they predict win for Scotland with fairer & secure future in UK #indyref #NoThanks
Asked PM when he realised his campaign to block Juncker was failing & what he changed. Answer - when it is going badly just keep going
@elspethhathaway @cara_hilton @scottishlabour @FifeLabour and Margaret giving her a well earned kiss x
@RossHighEnglish so pleased. Just the start of a great adventure
@LeeMartin4947 @Pulse984 not sure when I will be out west but thanks for thinking of me #lovecommunityradio

@DugsnPubs @LothianLoop thanks again. Love the pretzels in @FalkoBakery
@LothianLoop @DugsnPubs brilliant. Many thanks
@LothianLoop can you help? Which eating places in East Lothian welcome dogs please?
@iainmcr2 @gavsuave no point. Just sharing
@gavsuave No. Don't think SNP MPs are pointless either
Playing Pointless app. Asked for names of MPs not in 3 main parties. All SNP MPs were Pointless.
Cameron gave Andy Coulson 2 chances. We gave him 3 to answer ? did Gus O'Donnell warn him about AC. He failed to answer every time
@BTC87 no just thought it was of interest. As a seasoned campaigner it seems a very low contact rate. Maybe quality not quantity?
@AJAnjinsan @LothianLoop Wily Woman Wins from Westminster
@BTC87 so 2 canvassers contacted 17-18 which is 8.5-9 per canvasser?
@KStarsmeare Alistair agreed to date from STV and BBC
@GrinBins @ScottStrachan12 @SammF10 @simon_telegraph @UK_Together @WeAreSTV if we had a Labour gov we would still be having #indyref
@LothianLoop thought you had sent me 4 kisses :-(
@RICmasscanvass @allangrogan so on average canvassers spoke to 9 voters?
@LothianLoop Wonderful Wanda Waltzes in Wallyford 
That was greedy. Night night
@LothianLoop Timorous Timothy Trembles in Tyninghame
@MclennanPaul best of luck. She would do a grand job
So Stanley Baxter is opposing independence. Er a per lying er on the fler. lord I am old #indyref
@MclennanPaul Tried to DM but you don't follow me. Wanted to ask how today went at school?
My ticket for the opening concert of @LammermuirFest has arrived. Looking forward to hearing Royal Northern Symphonia back in St Mary's
@rechargetranent @BBCCiN brilliant news, Allan
Maybe what we should have asked IDS is what has gone right while he has been at DWP. He could have given a shorter answer
IDS loses the rag with @ChrisBryantMP over issue of free school meals. Think the 'I' is for Irritable today
Not a lot of people know this but does anyone else think Mike Penning is morphing into angry Michael Caine?
Told Minister 1/2 of people diagnosed with MND live 14 months. They need help & quickly. Back payments not good enough when life is short
Asked Penning how long people with MND should wait for PIP. No answer. Said they were concentrating on people who need help #mndawareness
Waiting to ask DWP about delays in PIP claims. Have had some terrible cases in East Lothian
Great to read @kdugdalemsp in @Daily_Record today
Few more freckles after door knocking in Tranent with @Shaminakhtar  & Cllr Jim Gillies. Only 10% voting Yes. #UnitedWithLabour
@KiltedKelpie @youngwd1 I think we need a climate union
If you like me were inspired by @GordonAikman ask your MP to support my EDM for more research & better support for MND #MNDAwareness

@sheils27 @WeePans were brilliant. Really enjoyed their singing
@KatePotts11 @GrinBins cyber group hug for the girls!
@GrinBins they call us bullies! Have experienced similar & it can feel scary. Better not to respond as that feeds his behaviour
@GrinBins can tell you are a strong woman. So pleased you have the guts to speak up. Don't let anyone stop you #bettertogether
Great day to share with @IainGrayMSP in EL. Sunshine, music, sport, local heroes & heroines & most of all community spirit #batonrelay

co called Money Matters call me & hang up when I say I want to unsubsribe. If they had given me that option in text, no need to call
Such demand to ask ?s of Home Sec I didn't get called. No apology or reimbursement of fees which are down to her incompetence
Never seen so many people on their feet to ask Ms May - #whereareourpassports
@kevwodonnell says only a handful of people will read it. Think that might not be the case now
Waiting to ask Home Sec if she will reimburse upgrade fee to my constituents who did everything right in the passport process

@calummiller given your opinion of me, really no point in engaging in this. Makes you grumpier and me sadder. #NoThanks
@DavidSBerry @calummiller I have a spade but no SPAD
@LeeMartin4947 @CraigAllanSmith want fairness for people across UK
@CraigAllanSmith @LeeMartin4947 were you at the Yes launch?
@calummiller @jk_rowling @IainGrayMSP @elcourier Imitation is sincerest form of flattery #NoThanks
@calummiller @jk_rowling or refreshingly consistent #bettertogether #NoThanks
IDS corrects Vince's response to my question about JSA sanctions and refusal to accept zero hours contracts. When uni credit comes in?
@RachelReevesMP points out that gov failure to make work pay is increasing the benefits bill.
Please help support No Thanks (Red), add a #Twibbon now! http://t.co/ypRSgMjpEP
IDS told off by Deputy Speaker for not listening to debate. @InverclydeMP is making a great speech. He should listen
@fsb_hq poll of businesses in Scotland shows damage being done by period of uncertainty. Let's end that on 18 Sep by saying #NoThanks

If a politician says don't vote Labour anywhere in the UK but I want a Labour government, is that credible? Fri Apr 03 23:41:49 BST 2015
@Steviebsnp I'll try one more time. Did the SNP ask the Tories to form a coalition in East Lothian? Just a yes or no will suffice Fri Apr 03 22:36:26 BST 2015
@Steviebsnp you haven't answered the question. Did your leader ask the Tories to form a coalition? Fri Apr 03 22:06:11 BST 2015
@heatherw1976 @Steviebsnp did you ask the Tories to form a coalition with the SNP in East Lothian? Fri Apr 03 21:55:16 BST 2015
We all know why Nicola Sturgeon wants a Tory govt. She puts her political project before what is best for a Scotland in #GE2015 Fri Apr 03 21:52:08 BST 2015
I look forward to someone asking Nicola Sturgeon why she would rather have Cameron as PM in the next TV debate Fri Apr 03 21:49:44 BST 2015
@GazFleming1 well, the Electoral Commission are fine with it Fri Apr 03 21:44:42 BST 2015
Statement by Nicola Sturgeon that she'd rather Cameron remain as PM is a slap in the face for every Scot who has suffered under the Tories. Fri Apr 03 21:44:13 BST 2015
@GazFleming1 but that is what it will say under my name on the ballot paper Fri Apr 03 20:59:20 BST 2015

Nicola Sturgeon would be more credible on housing if she supported @scottishlabour proposal to cap rent increases in private rented sector Thu Apr 02 21:53:02 BST 2015

Labour needs to come clean on the tax rises it will hit hardworking families with. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:37:59 BST 2015
Is that all? Labour's Manifesto is nothing new but still dangerous. More spending, more borrowing and more tax. #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:33:18 BST 2015
Remember @Ed_Miliband tuition fees policy only benefits best off. Our policy has seen number of disadvantaged students going to uni up Mon Apr 13 11:31:41 BST 2015
They promised 'iron discipline' before. They entered the crisis with biggest structural deficit in G7. A £73bn deficit (IMF) #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:30:18 BST 2015

.@Ed_Miliband has zero credibility on the deficit - Everybody knows Labour will borrow more & they will borrow forever #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:15:32 BST 2015
Their page on budget responsibility was only added last Fri. They promised ‘no more borrowing’ in '97. Look how that ended up #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:13:50 BST 2015
Apparently Labour's manifesto doesn't include all their policies. What are they hiding? #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:11:29 BST 2015

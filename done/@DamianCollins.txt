@CheritonWeather if that's the issue we could discuss that or even find a new home for the Banksy in the town. They acted without asking.
@FolkestoneCalls or a @CQ_folkestone property. They would be happy to look after it.
The #Folkestone Banksy artwork was a gift to the town, not for the profit of one person. We must do what we can to try and get it back

@Savekentsracing look again, it's still there. Racing calendar does not help smaller courses
@lizpeaceBPF they should join the growing number of creative businesses setting up in #Folkestone @GROWFORIT @CQ_folkestone @WorkshopF
@caitlinmoran great piece in @thetimes Come and look as well at the east Kent creative coast 55mins from London @CQ_folkestone @GROWFORIT
@lashkartom congratulations on your selection for Tonbridge and West Malling.
@Savekentsracing I went with a longstanding supporter of Folkestone races to support the course
@Savekentsracing I think there is also a broader question about reforming the racing calendar to give courses like Folkestone a chance
@Savekentsracing I would love to see the course re-open but this requires agreement between the owners and the planning authority.
My advice centres this pm are at Lydd, New Romney, St Mary's Bay, Dymchurch and Hythe. Then off to an event at The Pilot Inn at Dungeness
@JezGiddings thanks. It was great to hear more about your exciting plans.

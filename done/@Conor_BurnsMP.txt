@timothy_stanley @itvcorrie @bbcquestiontime I would have thought you would have approved of that anti-modernity!
@PaulTwinn Haha. I'm bang up to date. I'm a big Corrie fan!
@timothy_stanley @itvcorrie @bbcquestiontime Is that 'we' in the 'we have become a Grandmother' sense?
@timothy_stanley No. I think he is referring to Peter Barlow who was freed this week. Deirdre is so 90's Tim! @itvcorrie @bbcquestiontime

@Bloss45 If you have followed exchanges between @LordAshcroft and @anthea_bailey today you may need to point her that way soon!
Fascinating watching Earl Attlee interviewed in 1964 saying cabinet of 23 was far too big. Thought it should be max of 16 or 17.
Great to be able to support the charity that works to help @RBCH_NHS this evening at the West Hants Club. Met some very dedicated people
Looks like the real victor in the EU budget row is Margaret Thatcher
Listening to my old friend @DanHannanMEP making some awkward points on EU. Sounded angry. Possibly correctly so
@DanWei55 I don't oppose wind farms. I oppose this one. Wrong proposal in wrong place and damaging to local economy
UPDATE: 'Start the process again' say opposition groups after new Navitus Bay wind farm plan announced http://t.co/5fobC5Y83a
@CameronBrownUK Declare your interest Cameron!
I predicted this Navitus con ages ago. Local people who have watched twists and spin will not be taken in. We fight on. We fight to win.
This is what is wrong with Parliament: 'motion on Abortion (Sex Selection). If there is a division the payroll should not vote.' Why not?
@ahbnewell I believe in equality of opportunity. I believe religious organisations contribute hugely to the country

@greenknight100 @Conservatives @matthancockmp @ukhomeoffice I assume you have evidence and have taken it to the police? Have you?
@UKinHolySee Sorry I won't be leading the delegation this year. Didn't want questions about my Bishop and Excommunication to distract
@kateford76 couldn't agree more. Disgrace she got compensation x
2/2: 400k and many years over 500k a year. Politicians do need to reflect legitimate public anxiety as Mrs T did before winning an election.
1/2: In 1978 Mrs Thatcher spoke of public fear of country being "rather swamped." Immigration was 187k. Every year since 2002 it is over
@walker_ajw Throwing abuse is not an argument. I'd expect better from someone studying for an MA at University

@Phillip_Blond @BBCRadioScot The two are not mutually exclusive
@magapanthus who was leading No campaign? Labour. Who headed it? Labour'a Mr Darling. Saved our ass? I don't think so.
@anthea_bailey Amazing. I'm in the Modern Day Slavery Bill Committee but want to get back to the chamber
@AbbasAli5000 Parliament deserves the respect of turning up regularly
Two classes of MPs. Those who barely come to Parliament yet get unlimited speaking time. G. Brown. Other class of MP: everyone else.
Gordon Brown speaking in chamber. Screen says he started at 14.32 and it is now 14.47 Screen also says 6min limit on backbench speech???
@SteveUnwin01 @MikeAR_ @DouglasCarswell I will be proud to stand on my record in my seat. And as campaigner against EU integration
@SteveSmithEcho not sorry to be missing Angela Pooley. Will be all about planet saving and nothing to do with the actual application in hand
If BBC reports are correct that Labour will boycott cross party talks on English votes on English laws it is disgraceful. We need fairness.
Disappointing to see people are trying to play party politics over Navitus. It is more important for our area than that.
@SteveSmithEcho I'm refreshing the page frequently!
@SteveSmithEcho having spoken against Navitus many times in Parliament wish I was able to be at hearing today. But on Modern Slavery Bill
@SuzanneEvans1 @DouglasCarswell I've been in my Party for longer than many of 'them' and will be in it for many years to come. No ducking!

@therealgokwan What event are you coming to in Parliament?
Calm down people. A chat with another politician doesn't equal defection. I joined Conservative Party at 14 and will spend my life in it.
Just had good chat with Nigel Farage after @DouglasCarswell took his seat in the House of Commons
@thefifer1314 @TimSwinyard Do you seriously want to say that 'all caused by the Tories'?
Thinking of the courage of Margaret Thatcher and the sacrifice of those who died in Brighton 30 yrs ago today at the hands of IRA cowards.

@ToryPier @CCHQPress @DouglasCarswell Because politicians don't decide the result. IN or OUT question. Public decide. Labour means no say.

Felt very emotional watching William Hague's final speech at conference. Was proud to stand in 2001 under his leadership. A great leader.
@reporterboy Everyone speaks for themselves. But speculation because of a mate's action isn't fair on Dan or anyone else
@reporterboy @rosschawkins @JGForsyth he, nor anyone else, should be forced to issue loyalty statements. We aren't in the Soviet Union

Compulsory viewing @afneil dismantling Jim Murphy on higher tuition fees in England voted in by Scots MPs. Labour so on the wrong side
Good that PM is meeting a few MPs to discuss fairness for those who represent England in Parliament. Shame he isn't meeting us all
Salmond should pack his bags now and stop pretending to be a democrat | via @Telegraph http://t.co/PFQs0E9GtX
Labour voted against equal votes by equal seats. Say Scottish MPs should vote on England but not vice versa. Does Lab believe in democracy?
Just back from speaking to the Wells Conservative Patron's Club in Somerset. Loyal supporters
A couple of good speeches in referendum debate does not give Gordon Brown the right to act as if he were still PM. Who will break it to him?
@Margaret_Curran @ChukaUmunna you are in denial if you think this can be done without sorting Scottish votes on English matters at same time
@TimMontgomerie He was seriously impressive at the Parliamentary Party away day last year. Conviction and passion.
The logic of current group think would be for Miliband to enact the Conservative manifesto if he wins to respect the views of those who lost
@richkennett great to hear from you. How are you? Well remember our meetings in your SUSU Treasurer's offic
Great interview by @afneil on @BBCNewsnight with Shadow Business Secretary. Couldn't name Shadow Labour Government of Scotland. Blush.
@hoeykateMP @jameschappers Well said Kate. We need to assert the rights of our constituents. Fair deal for Scotland. And England.
@mrSEan1 @Spectator_CH thank you! Was great to meet you all.
There is nothing 'child like' about my constituents wanting English votes on English matters as Ken Clarke saying #bbcaq
@chrisshipitv So Labour supports fairness as long as it doesn't disadvantage them. Precisely what is wrong with politics.
@SunterAndrew a very good day for Great Britain. A day for healing. But not with you. Blocked.
Listening to @BBCNews interviewing Richard Branson from his tax exile island about how much he cares for Britain is just too much
@DPJHodges @JananGanesh @mickfealty I agree. As does Lord Barnett ironically. A mess. The 'vow' should have been put to Parliament first.
@DPJHodges @JananGanesh @mickfealty Both are. I can't vote on schools in Scotland. Why should an MP in Scotland vote on schools in my area?
@allanholloway @DPJHodges @JananGanesh You might very well think that. I couldn't possibly comment. As FU would have said.
@JananGanesh @DPJHodges Otherwise very sensible Labour people just cannot understand how it is untenable for MPs to vote on devolved issues
@JananGanesh Labour will try to fight or fudge it. But if it is not resolved we will see rise of English nationalism which worries me
@JananGanesh Spot on as usual Janan
Excellent and thoughtful article by colleague and friend James Wharton MP Conservative Home http://t.co/OC9F775WI0
Labour talk of devo to regions is code for Scotland's MPs must retain right to vote on England only matters. Absolutely not on. Equality now
@LiamHalligan well said
@MatthewPWoods indeed. Shame our leaders lost their nerve
@rjpdf @PaulGoodmanCH thank you. Looks like Union is going to be ok. Hope you art not very disappointed
@TomJBeasley come on Tom. This is history. Worth staying up for surely?
We must watch this closely. Jim Murphy suggests MPs from Scotland should keep voting on issues in England that are devolved. Just not on.
@alan_macleod @PaulGoodmanCH @BBCNews Don't agree with that. He recognised need to have fairness for England. As an MP born in NI I agree
The superb Michael Forsyth talking great sense on @BBCNews This now needs a UK solution not just a Scotland one.
@graemearcher @Isaac_Spring are you surprised? She is wrong on almost, if not everything, she comments on.
Our Scottish campaign will encourage English Nationalism unless the voice of England is heard http://t.co/UoMQGsgVcr via @spectator_ch

@MatthewPWoods Then best to stop this. Many of us are imposing self-restraint until this is over.
@MatthewPWoods I have campaigned in Scotland for a 'no' vote. I will also defend the right to equality for those who elected me.
@MatthewPWoods I am an elected member of the UK Parliament. This debate has an impact on my constituents as well. So no I won't 'button it'.
@cagedred As I'm gay I doubt he thought that of me! Blocked
Watching Gordon Brown on BBC. At least he does now what many think should happen after devo-max. As an MP from Scotland he barely votes
@DarrelKwong Actually if you look at figures on Echo site I'm 5th lowest out of the 7 and less than half of the highest on travel
Always interesting to see how MPs traveling from roughly the same areas roughly the same amount of times have such different travel claims
@RMMarques20 no actually. And anyone whose picture is them posing with symbol of Soviet Communist repression isn't someone I wish to hear
Delivering message from PM in Madrid earlier at naming of Plaza de Margaret Thatcher with Madrid's Mayor https://t.co/XUDXV41DRI
@iainmartin1 Absolutely right. They are in denial. This has highlighted something that many of us have talked about for years.
Looking forward to the ceremony to name 'Plaza de Margaret Thatcher' in Madrid this morning with our excellent Ambassador @SimonManleyFCO
Devo for cities is dangerous atm. Will be used to cloud debate over Scots MPs in Westminster and leave their voting power in England intact
@JohnLehal I saw him quoted as saying that begins the process of more power to Scotland. It does not. That is for a Bill before Parliament.
@GregBarkerMP @BBCWestminHour @johnredwood Absolutely correct Greg. It is about equality of representation for those we serve in England
Gordon Brown must have been misquoted saying he will use an Adjournemoent debate to start devo-max in Oct. They are not for national fixing
Heading to Madrid this afternoon to take part in ceremony to name Plaza de Margaret Thatcher. A great tribute by our Spanish friends
Going to bed depressed. If self styled "Islamic State" could be defeated by words/threats they wouldn't now exist. They do. We need action.
@afneil we must act. Pope supports military intervention. UK Govt doesn't. As my Granny used to say 'what we have lived to see'
@AlistairBurtMP Could not agree with your more
@MatthewPWoods When I have campaigned for a 'no' vote in Scotland. We all want fairness. Including those I'm accountable to in Bournemouth
@MatthewPWoods I think we are being incredibly restrained. But won't have people saying after 'well you didn't raise concerns before' We did
@Simon_Nixon @faisalislam And we will. I want Scotland to stay. But I also want fair representation in Parliament for my constituents.
@faisalislam @Simon_Nixon @thesundaytimes not seen the #neverendum before. but that could well be the problem. Astute observation
@Simon_Nixon @faisalislam @thesundaytimes I mean what more powers to Scotland mean for rest of UK. Number and role of MPs from Scotland etc
@faisalislam @thesundaytimes This is very worrying for the longer term. Shame there is so little talk about what it means for rest of UK
@johnbenner3 Do you pay your staff out of your salary? This absurd exchange is finished.

@DanHannanMEP well said. 20 plus years of consistency
@AMMorrisMP @thetimes @DouglasCarswell Well said. Snobbish, patronising and elitist. Why do people who don't like people go into politics?
Very sorry to hear the sad news of Jim Dobbin's death. He was a man of huge integrity and warmth. Stranger's bar will miss his humour

Watched the debate. Lady I canvassed in Scotland is right: "This is more important than Alex Salmond wanting to be in the history books."
@IsabelOakeshott Quite. Came up a bit on doorstep. We must rearrange a coffee
Salmond's bullying and hectoring tone towards Darling may explain why more women are voting No. Very unattractive debating style. No humour
The bitterness and polarisation of the audience in #indyref is exactly what i experienced over the days knocking on doors in Scotland
This walking around during the debate is probably modelled on the West Wing. It was great TV. But it isn't working here. This really matters
@politicshome surely, by definition, it is past mistakes that have created the situation we find ourselves in today?

@andym_echo You know I don't. However having been involved in the meetings I know all facts. Happily share when this is over
@neilmeldrumecho absolutely not. I'm just hoping we don't get bad images of our town on bank holiday weekend
@neilmeldrumecho well people are certainly aware now. EDL must be rejoicing at the counter demo. Just what they thrive on
@neilmeldrumecho I was involved in police and council meetings. Police expectation was of very small numbers.
@PatrickWOakley That is advice I would echo. But profoundly regret that they need to. We must work to reassure them that they are welcome
@GrooveeOne Hardly on the same scale of seriousness for our town's reputation
@GrooveeOne @MCHypnosis what was last Saturday
Extraordinary Pope advocates morality of military action to stop IS and UK Govt doesn't. As my Gran used to say 'What we have lived to see'
Sensationalist coverage of the EDL march in Bournemouth is irresponsible. If unreported it would probably be a non event attracting very few
@anthea_bailey You would have adored her. A former teacher. Glad @stevebrine allowed me to help on an issue for her. I will miss her badly.
Gutted to hear my first Chairman in Eastleigh has died. Bobbie Jones was a great servant of our Party and a loyal friend a protector of mine

@Frererabit Who used those words?
@ProfJCharmley sadly I cannot disagree with you. And I don't say that lightly
Who would have thought I'd ever say this? Good on France with a Socialist President for arming Kurds in Iraq. Moral leadership
Now that the PM is back I hope he will listen to those of us who want more action on Iraq and will allow that to be expressed in Parliament
@SophyRidgeSky I have spoken to 3 Cons who voted against last year who would support on this. And Labour MPs as well.
@SophyRidgeSky A vote would be won clearly. Problem is they are stuck in mind set on last year's vote. Depressing. Meanwhile deaths rise
Why is media falling into trap and using term 'Islamic State'? Very dangerous. They aren't a state they are evil terrorists fuelled by hate
@MrTonyGordon Nothing I have said justifies that tweet
@PatrickWOakley Thank you Pat. In politics the most important thing is to say what you believe rather than to pander popularity for office
@KellyBonner yes of course
I have written to the PM this morning to ask for recall of Parliament on Iraq and explain reasons why I think it vital UK does more to help
Narrow support for UK air strikes before case is even made. Govt must not make decisions based on last year's polling http://t.co/YpKF7mRSI4
@TimMontgomerie thanks Tim. I will. I remember the Balkans. We got there in the end. I expect Parliament to be recalled next week
@TimMontgomerie and that's before the case has even been made by our leaders. They need to understand this isn't Syria all over again
British leader faces growing calls to join U.S. bombing in Iraq http://t.co/G8OVLLIflI via @washingtonpost
I want Parliament recalled to question policy of Govt. It can't happen unless Govt ask for it. This power needs to go to Parliament not Exec
@HaremKarem That doesn't change my view. Let's see how this evolves
@fleetstreetfox They don't. And I never said they did.
@fleetstreetfox I didn't start bitching Ms Boniface from the Mirror. You did.
@fleetstreetfox You must feel so much better for getting that off your chest Susie from the Mirror. Parody of what we have been saying
@ayestotheright @OwenJones84 Blocking works. The fewer followers the worse the abuse. I've grown an extra skin since I joiner Twitter.
@HurricaneJames7 I could not agree more. I watched that again yesterday. When you have time we should meet in London
@cdonnithorne1 Thank you. Very kind from one of the brightest rising stars of the Conservative movement. Principles vital. But 1n too many!
@carolynquinncq @BBCWestminHour @AlistairBurtMP I heard. AB was good. I want us to debate what is going on. We don't seem to have a policy
I have emailed Mr Speaker asking for recall of Parliament to debate UK response to the massacre of Christians and other minorities in Iraq
@TimMontgomerie @GlynDaviesMP @gallaghereditor we will Tim. Great article btw. I've told Chief Whip I think time has come to recall HofC
@GlynDaviesMP @gallaghereditor @TimMontgomerie We do need to come back. Aid welcome but not enough. Arm Kurds, up air strikes. Get a policy
The British Govt must urgently agree to help arm Iraqi Kurds to help them fight ISIS. Bold leadership needed now. Aid welcome but not enough
Having prayed for Iraq's Christians someone say the Lord's Prayer in a foreign language at Mass just now was overwhelmingly emotional
@therealitygap Arm the Kurds and use our special forces. If these people create a state we will feel the consequences violently here in UK
We should respond positively and urgently to Iraq Kurdish President plea for arms to fight back. I imagine this is how 1939 felt
Religious minorities in Iraq being buried alive and best West can do is fly-crawl to drop some food and water bottles. Shameful
@1SVN @JoanneG57276077 Well said Sheila. If this goes on it will fall into contempt and abolition follows. We should get a group together
Great to open the St Ambrose Church Summer Fete and to chat to some many of my fellow Westbourne residents
@MrRBourne They don't even pretend it is Ryan
My latest constituency e-bulletin is out today http://t.co/57hOWdB5CV
I resigned to protect the principle of an appointed Lords. Not one packed to the rafters. It is wrong to keep appointing so many new Peers
@anthea_bailey Can't help thinking we need a 1991 style safe-haven approach. But with this paralysis in the West the Christians will be gone
@__S_P @His_Grace What a fatuous comment
@gme7 Not enough although this is an experience bigger than party sniping
@GuidoFawkes or even better just be a friend of the Conservative Party and Conservative principles and values
As thousands of Christians in Iraq flee in fear of their lives could Obama's Nobel Peace Prize seem any more hollow this evening?
At Branksome Tesco block railing against “corrupt politicians and bankers“.  Sees I'm not amused. “You're not a banker?“. “No I'm a MP“.
Thank goodness for @Pontifex strong call for international help for persecuted Christians in Iraq. Pray that it is responded to
@ChristianJMay It is unbelievable
@Felix_KingE Thank you Felix
As Iraq's Christians are driven from their homes by Islamic terrorists both @BBCNews and @SkyNews give us live coverage of a foreign trial
@pollytoynbee Good to see you on @BBCNewsnight. Still no reply as to whether I need to apologise to you for saying you owned a foreign Villa
@samdwebber @CharlesHMoore @ConHome @IainDale A generation sadly fading away
@VascoDaBabber78 @wallaceme @BBCNewsnight 2000+ tweets. 40 followers. Says it all
Slightly surprised that @BBCNewsnight put resignation of a junior Minister ahead of the debate on the future integrity of the United Kingdom
@ChrisBryantMP @TimMontgomerie They are pay roll though. Let me know when you are back Chris and I can let you know what a principle is.
@TimMontgomerie Not if count Lords Reform
@Kevin_Maguire is right on #skypapers on @Ed_Miliband and the wreath. This attempt to create a row is unseemly on a day such as this
Really poor for people to play politics about @Ed_Miliband wreath on such a historic day when our thoughts should be about the fallen
@adamrickitt As always Adam. Drop me a text and we can catch up
@adamrickitt ball is firmly in your court on that front Adam! Get yourself and the future Mrs Rickitt to the House for drinks in Sept or Oct
@adamrickitt Wow! When is the big day?
@andrewjteacher Happy to have a chat. Feel free to DM me and we can arrange something. Being honest I think Govt won't change it atm
@DanHannanMEP @Irish_Fart14 Very well put Dan
@DanHannanMEP @Irish_Fart14 He is from Belfast Dan and Irish flag is his backdrop. It's amazing how many in NI think Churchill a warmonger
Letter signing done. Now to postbox. This is why its called a recess not a holiday http://t.co/Co1LjlsYC6
@SkyNews Why no pics of Bournemouth in your piece on VAT on tourism? It is Britain's leading resort
Arriving at Poole Quay for a service to remember World War I
VIDEO: MP's anger over "intimidating" and "offensive" behaviour from travellers camp (From Bournemouth Echo) http://t.co/RzGCA3KHgK
I find it so amusing that someone who polled 15 votes constantly attacks me on @Bournemouthecho comments page. Always makes me laugh
@kimcoverack tell that to those who had to clean up the area and the consequences of them using it as a toilet despite having those in vans
Congratulations @mimsdavies on your selection for my old stomping ground of Eastleigh. Good luck!
Good visit to Slade's Farm after High Court granted eviction order on travellers. With Council Leader, Police and others
Travellers issue has been a nightmare. @bournemouthbc need to be given the powers to act immediately and prevent this waste of money
@bournemouthuni @DrDGL @BBCRadio4 Very much agree with last point. Blair won by accepting Thatcher reforms. He did so because Thatcher won
@bournemouthuni @DrDGL @BBCRadio4 Very. Seems we MPs are all least worse of what's on offer!
@NigelParkin3 @judge_joe Nationality or ethnic origin are irrelevant.They are breaking the law and when they go we pay for clean up
@bournemouthuni @BBCRadio4 @DrDGL The one on now is fascinating
@Joseamey I respect your view. But its not one shared by the many who enjoy using the open space and now cannot
@Mari_Williams let's give the keys back to the people who crashed the car?
Just been to see the illegal encampment at Slades Farm. An insult to law abiding tax payment residents http://t.co/ECnrSa71OS
@jamesjayazz @jameschappers @JGForsyth 52 followers and not a constituent of mine. Goodbye
@JGForsyth You are absolutely right. If BBC get a debate it must be shown UK wide. I'm writing to Lord Hall to ask for that assurance
Going to see an illegal encampment by so called travellers that is making life miserable for some of my constituents
@gemmadunning Glad we were able to help. Have a good break!
@nigelfletcher Birch also designed Bournemouth's main Pier and I would contend it is pretty fine
Dreadful to see Eastbourne's Pier on fire.
@jameschappers @JGForsyth Sir Peter T
@DrEoinCl it is fresh
First day back at the gym after a gap. Much to do to get back on track. Tuna salad as part of the summer regime tonight
@BrutonMichael beware people with sub 300 followers who are not constituents
@waynesmith1971 you have a very twisted view of the world
@waynesmith1971 Check what I did on Lords Reform Bill before levelling that I'll informed accusation at me
PMQs for the people is silly gimmick. Politics seems irrelevant due to politicians giving powers to bodies we don't elect and can't remove
@LouiseJohn @WestCliffChurch @gemmadunning Email me and we will see what we can do. I don't do casework through twitter
This @BBCNews business correspondent (Victoria something) is disgracefully and shamelessly biased.
@beachwordsmith @Toastmasters I enjoyed it. What a great group of people. I'd happily come along again
@pollytoynbee No reply from you Polly. You seem to suggest it is a lie that you owned an Italian holiday home. If it is so I will apologise
@pollytoynbee are you saying you have never owned a holiday home in Italy? If that is so I will apologise at once
@JananGanesh Well said. Totally agree
Interesting evidence session on the Modern Slavery Bill. I'm on the Bill Committee in September. Really worthwhile legislation.
@LordAshcroft @anthea_bailey Anthea without one of the good Lord's polls I might not have left Eastleigh and you wouldn't have selected me!
Watching @therealgokwan Having done a course in Chinese cookery how have I not seen before. I want to meet him
@Tombaldwinscoke @LewesSpeakerFes @pollytoynbee @NormanBakerMP I didn't mention the Tuscan Villa at all. Thought that would be tasteless
I would have welcomed chance to continue debate with guy who questioned me on Mrs T and Blair/New Labour @LewesSpeakerFes
Enjoyed debating with @pollytoynbee in Lewes this evening. Polite yet robust exchanges and great questions. Well chaired by @NormanBakerMP
Interesting @Ed_Miliband says UK has 'deficit to deal with AND DEBT TO PAY DOWN'. Right. Need to hear much more on the latter from all sides
Went down to the Lords to listen to Assisted Dying Bill which I oppose. Now off to lunch to celebrate a Knighthood for a great friend
@ayestotheright is he a medical Doctor?
@ProfRWinston That is the perfect summing up of my outlook on this Bill. Superbly put
@ayestotheright Outrage! @itvcorrie
@MrTomWisdom Am I missing something? Where do I see #Dominion ? I've seen most of your work
@ChrispyKay I don't disagree with that. From the polling card in your video I thought you were in the East
@ChrispyKay I think using humour to expose hypocrisy in politics is a good device yes. I watched your video. Your bro is in Bournemouth East
@ChrispyKay Shame you think politics doesn't matter
William Hague getting everyone laughing at Lib Dems is a wonderful sight.
@MattCheetham I have told my Whip I will be abstaining on this Bill.  It should have been given time for proper scrutiny by Parliament
@MattCheetham The only vote we have had so far was on the Programme Motion which is on timetable
@VCJohnVinney share your feeling about David. But @gregclarkmp is a first class MP and knows Bournemouth well. We will have to get him down
@billmanwaring I'd love to serve in NI. No chance of being asked though

@markhobanmp That's very funny!
Wonder if @Pontifex and his predecessor are watching World Cup and supporting their national teams from the Vatican?
Another role model for young people as @IanThorpe comes out. The world has changed so much since I was growing up in the 1980s
Great response from crowd to short speeches by Mayor and me in Triangle at second Pride event of the day
@annajayne That is so typical to change the argument. Where have I said we should rely on fossil fuels? Nowhere.
@annajayne Yours is the very of a very small minority. Thankfully.
Wound up over wind farm (From Bournemouth Echo) http://t.co/r5F23Pbnrc I agree with every word of this. We fight on

@BlackBerryHelp UKBlackberry have suggested I contact you to get assistance with a problem with my phone
@UK_BlackBerry Yes I'm afraid I am still having this problem
@TheDecider25 @sbrine To represent such lovely places as Winchester and Bournemouth
@tomwilson23 @sbrine No in economy. Was referring to constituencies we are lucky to represent. Not seats on train!
On train after speaking to Winchester Patrons. As train goes through Eastleigh thinking how blessed @sbrine and I are to have seats we do
On my way to Winchester to speak for my old friend and colleague @sbrine at his Patrons Club
@MelVassEcho A Clegg visit must be worth votes for the Conservative candidate
If anyone is trying to contact me please do not text. My @UK_BlackBerry is now deleting all texts as they arrive. So frustrating

Excellent meeting with Schools Minister and officials discussing exciting ideas for a local Academy. News soon I hope. Long journey to here

@JunckerEU Most of us in the UK are far from proud. As to your claim to have won an EU wide election well that's just farcical
EU decision today gives us a new Delors. I remember how hated in UK he was in 80s. History may look back at this being pivotal day for UK/EU
Great to see the students after today's graduation ceremony walking through the town to beach front reception. Lucky to have @inspiredAUM
Those with fewest followers send most abusive tweets. This afternoon's random sample. 9, 13, 81 and 3. Seems to validate the theory.
Feels slightly Strange to be watching Tina's funeral on @itvcorrie having been chatting to a vibrant @michkeegan in Westminster last night
Govt absolutely right to tackle visa abuse. But we must not lose sight of positive economic impact of foreign students and language sector
@discovery77_ Very happy to reply if you email me. I don't do your sort of question on twitter
@TheDecider25 no about the sitting times
Great to see people out enjoying Bournemouth in this lovely weather. Sorry to be going to London http://t.co/ldsBtYDjrx
Jerry Hayes spouting nonsense on #Murnaghan about sitting times of Parliament. And factually incorrect nonsense
@RobWilson_RDG it was my pleasure. What a lovely group of people you had there
Voting opens in 5mins for new Chairman of Health Select Committee. Some excellent candidates. Proud to be supporting my friend Dr Philip Lee
Guardian attack on me call Sir Stephen Bubb in aid. Yes he also is yet another former Labour Councillor. Trend developing. Sector packed

@IanChisnall @oxfamgb That is to confuse 2 separate issues.  I want to test whether that sort of ad is in accord with charitable status.
@IanChisnall @oxfamgb Fixing the economy so it creates jobs and tax revenues. Trying to get public finances back into balance.
@IanChisnall @oxfamgb Interesting piece. You speak of trying to address the symptoms. Through politics we try to address the causes.
Looking forward to speaking to Chief Whip's Patrons Club dinner in Hampshire this evening
@RunningFlushFCC @Aphyid you are an excellent example. Blocked

@trannymum It was the Labour party that destroyed Britain's finances and lumbered future generations with debt. At least know facts
@cranfieldadams What utter complete nonsense. Unlike you I don't go parroting the prejudices of our opponents about my party
@cranfieldadams what a very silly remark. Stereotype is created by comments like yours.
I have written this morning to the Chairman of the Charity Commission asking them to investigate Oxfam's highly political advertising

Superb news on raising tax free savings ISA limit to £15,000 from July. Rewarding those who do the right thing
Excellent news that the compulsory purchase of an annuity is ending. Have argued for this for years.
@jmackin2 Thankfully very few of my colleagues are trustafarians. Most are meritocratic

In London for @Donal_Blaney's 40th do. This will be a gathering of very sound Conservatives. 20 years fighting the left since SUCA days
My latest bulletin is out today http://t.co/IRvrXhtohc
@Mike_Fabricant You would be very welcome!
An excellent speech by Sir Edward Leigh. Reminding people that Conservatives believe in merit not quotas
Good for Edward Leigh slapping down fundamentally unConservative ideas. 'Positive discrimination' has no place in meritocratic politics
The refusal to revoke other Downey style letters is cowardly and spineless. And incomprehensible. I'm very worried about NI's future today
@FreeThinkingUK @HRAngstrom It does. Captures her power and, oddly, her vulnerability in later years
Great chat to John Eden. Marking 60 years of continuous service in Parliament. MP for my seat 1954-83. Lord Eden of Winton since. Super guy
@FreeThinkingUK @HRAngstrom wonderful
@rattlecans Silly question as Scotland will stay in the UK
@Miguelencasa Blocked. Prat
Heading back to London after speaking at a fun lunch for Bournemouth Rotary Club
@tobyhelm He wasn't so right in his often repeated assertion that Britain was doomed outside the Euro and inward investment would dry up
After a good morning working with our 2015 local Council candidates now out delivering my MP survey to another ward. Beautiful clear day

Looking forward to seeing British talent on display this evening #EEBAFTAs
@rwillmsen @DanHannanMEP We don't about the views of people like you. Blocked.
@DanHannanMEP @ZacGoldsmith Dan MPs are not. Leaders are. Important difference. I'd vote for it anytime

@ag4stars thank you Andrew. You knew James. He ran my 05 campaign and stayed with me frequently when we were neighbours
When one of your best friends has died aged just 28 it is almost impossible to sleep. Miss you massively already JC

Home at last after a very vibrant Sixty-Six Club dinner. Immigration, NHS, EU, visas, pensions and mortgages all put to me and debated
Looking forward to speaking to the first Sixty-Six Club President's Forum of 2014 in Bournemouth this evening
Brilliant fightback by @Magician147 at the Masters
Hosting a drop in session for MPs with campaigners against the wind farm. Good turnout of colleagues
When you find yourself in the division lobby on a vote on Europe with Denis Skinner and Kate Hoey you know you are in the right lobby
@jlj060453 @judd147t I always have the Masters on in the office while working. Especially if Judd is playing
In Chamber listening to a non explanation as to why Govt is backing measures to promote EU propaganda
Impressed @judd147t stayed to sign autographs for fans after failing to get through first round of the Masters. Classy
Really enjoying watching @judd147t in the first round of the snooker Masters. Always electrifying
Wonder what brings actors who play Roy Cropper and Eileen's ex to Parliament today
Delighted to be staying with one of my closest friends, Mark Worthington, as news of his Knighthood comes out for his service to Lady T
#ukip position on Syrian refugees maybe chaotic. But if it shines a light onto the appalling persecution of Christians it serves a purpose
Lovely Mass for Feast of the Holy Family on Falls Road @clonardmbelfast
@helen_kleinberg Are you back in Scotland or in Belfast?

Just presented prize to winner of my Christmas card competition at Moordown St John's Primary School. Staying for the Nativity play now
Very useful meeting bringing Leader of Bournemouth Council to meet Local Government Minister before financial settlement announcement

@JebBush Jeb it was a pleasure to host you and see you again. You won many new admirers today in the Parliamentary Party this afternoon
@marypetrie1702 Would have thought my Aunt would have known me better than to tweet that at me in open forum!
@MrBurkinshawF1 Totally disagree
@marypetrie1702 I didn't call him that. Someone replying to another comment did
There is something slightly unsettling seeing some of the celebrity tax dodgers at Mandela's Memorial Service

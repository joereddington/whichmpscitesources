@dickiesview @BenMosley @Max_Morris My concern is more that it's moving in the opposite direction, and showing signs of life... Mon Apr 27 10:08:40 BST 2015

@GreenBenali @CllrTomHayes @CalumSPlath We are! Sun Apr 26 23:49:26 BST 2015
@BenMosley @Max_Morris there are two jars, one is caramelised onion chutney and the other is red onion marmalade. I'm saving them for you. Sun Apr 26 23:47:56 BST 2015
@BenMosley @Max_Morris I almost threw out your caramelised onion chutney from the fridge last week, but couldn't bring myself to do it. Sun Apr 26 23:37:00 BST 2015
@Max_Morris Hello! @BenMosley disappeared off to Gloucester CC a couple of years ago, but we're still in touch. How's things with you? Sun Apr 26 23:29:59 BST 2015
@GreenBenali @CalumSPlath we're targeting all three Sun Apr 26 23:28:32 BST 2015
@CalumSPlath I've been out campaigning with Ben, I don't think anything would deter him from knocking on a door! Sun Apr 26 23:20:34 BST 2015
@CalumSPlath it goes to their sense of entitlement, same as being outraged we'd dare to put up a candidate in Brighton Pavilion. Sun Apr 26 23:14:25 BST 2015
@CorArdens yes, I remember when she was first selected seeing a piece by her on the Malevich exhibition, which I'd just been to, and loved. Sun Apr 26 23:01:45 BST 2015
@joerayment91 @AM_HC @tdebbonaire not sure yet, but probably around 4pm. There will be people out in East without me later, and West too. Sun Apr 26 21:16:55 BST 2015
@AM_HC campaigning morning and afternoon, including school gates, then radio debate early evening, Muslim community hustings after that. Sun Apr 26 20:50:03 BST 2015
@CaroleBristol I'm sure someone must have come up with Lying King, or Cuts (Cats) by now... #ToryMusicals Sun Apr 26 18:06:12 BST 2015

@willhquick @BrewhahaInc and you need to read up on what Andy Burnham has said about NHS market, as you're wrong. Sun Apr 26 01:18:01 BST 2015
@willhquick @BrewhahaInc I've replied to your email, no need to bombard me with tweets. Sun Apr 26 01:17:35 BST 2015
@BrewhahaInc but of course, benefits delays, punitive sanctions and in-work poverty are nothing at all to do with politics Sun Apr 26 00:33:49 BST 2015
@BrewhahaInc also hate "depoliticise" line, used to think it was naïveté but now think that, like GF's use of same, it's very calculated. Sun Apr 26 00:27:06 BST 2015
@BrewhahaInc ... who are seriously worried about future of NHS and are witnessing its decline first hand, including many health workers. Sun Apr 26 00:25:05 BST 2015
@BrewhahaInc it's the "grow up" (not the first time I've heard it) that really angers me. Tell that to people I've been speaking to in East. Sun Apr 26 00:24:00 BST 2015
@how_dairy @RftS_Bristol I saw them a few times, including the last time they reformed, Brixton Academy I think. Truly excellent. Sat Apr 25 22:30:25 BST 2015

@JonathanHaynes wasn't he, as Opposition Leader, told by aides to stop calling it "soccer" so he sounded less posh? Sat Apr 25 17:36:37 BST 2015

@arryTuttle suggest you give Barry Clarke our councillor a call. Sat Apr 25 10:08:24 BST 2015
The serious point behind last RT is that we already have one Ukip councillor in Hengrove and they're after a second, currently Labour. Sat Apr 25 09:38:59 BST 2015
@fbreckels wasn't my thing to invite people to...I only got invited at last minute. Sat Apr 25 08:32:19 BST 2015

@ryeandwry @robhi66 @RorsDM I was actually at their last ever gig at Wembley as I bought tickets for then boyfriend's birthday. Thu Apr 23 21:34:06 BST 2015
@robhi66 @RorsDM I quite like the Jam now, but wasn't allowed to back then! Also, word then was that Weller was a Tory. Thu Apr 23 20:43:58 BST 2015
@robhi66 @RorsDM We (the post-punk gang) liked Two Tone but the mods liked Secret Affair and the Merton Parkas, as well as the Jam. Thu Apr 23 20:25:22 BST 2015
@RorsDM I remember it well. It was a wet dinner break and all the mods came storming into the school hall cheering. We didn't approve. Thu Apr 23 20:02:35 BST 2015

Great initiative from @lushcampaigns to host election hustings. I'll be doing the Bristol one next Thursday, 30th. Thu Apr 23 19:51:50 BST 2015
@jbobtwit @OrchardSB that is true - start them early! Thu Apr 23 18:34:10 BST 2015
Whoever thinks young people aren't interested in politics should have seen today's hustings at @OrchardSB. Really enjoyed doing it. Thu Apr 23 15:36:19 BST 2015
@crookedfootball @stellduffy I think it's pretty clear already. It doesn't say post mortem and doesn't mean post mortem. Thu Apr 23 09:57:58 BST 2015
@crookedfootball @stellduffy doesn't say post mortem. Thu Apr 23 09:32:24 BST 2015

@rchrdthcshr @tom_watson @BristolSouthLab of course! Wed Apr 22 22:04:25 BST 2015
@JonWilton no, I said the Ukip assumption wasn't relevant, you still got a very detailed 2 page response to your 10 questions. Wed Apr 22 18:36:40 BST 2015
@JonWilton yes, I gave you a two page response to it, ten questions answered at length.... Wed Apr 22 18:35:33 BST 2015
@JonWilton but wasn't relevant, still gave you a two page reply... If you any comments on my response, please email me. Wed Apr 22 18:33:27 BST 2015
@JonWilton in that case, the last para of your email was, I'm told, why the person made that comment Wed Apr 22 18:32:17 BST 2015
@JonWilton are you happy for me to discuss publicly what was in your email? Wed Apr 22 18:30:17 BST 2015
@JonWilton person who said that thought you were contacting me from Ukip, as part of organised campaign. Wed Apr 22 18:23:16 BST 2015
@JonWilton yes, we spotted that, sorry - was a note from someone who'd pulled together some info for me Wed Apr 22 18:20:12 BST 2015

@jbobtwit Most of our income comes from ordinary members, but I agree with you it's a deterrent. FWIW, MPs pay double! Wed Apr 22 16:21:30 BST 2015
@jbobtwit Paying for Labour head office and regional offices, staff, campaigning, etc, and some of it goes to local parties. Wed Apr 22 16:20:47 BST 2015
Really enjoyed seeing students at St Brendan's this afternoon. Thanks so much to @drbrianmay for coming. https://t.co/11GYV3tP8H Wed Apr 22 16:17:30 BST 2015
@jbobtwit there are concessions, and we had £1 for young people offer, but I agree it's too much and counter-productive. Wed Apr 22 12:32:32 BST 2015
@GreenRobTelford I've got a few more to do but they're city wide. This is actually the only broadly-themed open to public one we've got. Wed Apr 22 10:56:29 BST 2015

@jeffers144 sorry to hear that, obviously not good enough - could you email me her name and address and I will see what I can do! Tue Apr 21 20:41:13 BST 2015
@Souterain but I can assure you @tdebbonaire, Labour's candidate for West, isn't "a Clifton nob". She lives in St Werburghs and is great. Tue Apr 21 19:30:44 BST 2015
@Souterain there were boundary charges before the 2010 election and, sadly, Easton and Lawrence Hill went into Bristol West. Tue Apr 21 19:29:30 BST 2015

@Laurence_139 @LabourBristol what are you suggesting we do instead? Mon Apr 20 23:20:06 BST 2015
@Laurence_139 @LabourBristol in East, quite tiny compared to something like Metro I'd have thought. Not everyone is online. Mon Apr 20 23:16:16 BST 2015
@bristol_citizen @deadlydarcy I've just looked it up online. It's called "port". So there you go. Not brown. Mon Apr 20 23:09:44 BST 2015
@marcocondren did he say he wanted condoms to pay tax? How would that work then? Mon Apr 20 22:49:27 BST 2015

@tom_watson Hi there, we've sorted out what we're doing with you next Monday. Bit of campaigning then karaoke & pizza. Does that sound OK?! Mon Apr 20 17:33:51 BST 2015
@KylieSaysRelax Hopefulyl later tonight or tomorrow, sorry, it's' just massively busy as you can imagine. Not in office much, Mon Apr 20 17:30:21 BST 2015
@bigade1665 Ed M and Yvette have both called for action. I think if public can be mobilised, the Govt might be forced to act. Mon Apr 20 13:33:43 BST 2015
@KelvinBlake well as you can tell from my Twitter account (especially my favourites) it's something of an obsession... Mon Apr 20 09:35:16 BST 2015

@wood5y @iBristolPeople @BristolCouncil see my last tweet... I agree. You wouldn't want your kids "playing out" in those streets... Sun Apr 19 11:41:35 BST 2015
@iBristolPeople but it does need COUNCIL to act - and instructions/ resources to do so from Mayor, that's where responsibility lies Sun Apr 19 11:40:06 BST 2015
@iBristolPeople we need a zero tolerance zone - council need to make it a priority, clean up more regularly, action against culprits Sun Apr 19 11:36:14 BST 2015

@allyska as @tanyahazellphot says - candidates from each party being put on the spot, answering Qs from audience. Like Question Time. Tue Apr 14 08:10:18 BST 2015
@BristolSHS @GabrielScally I think if she had time to look into it, she'd find Labour acknowledges & plans to address many of her points Tue Apr 14 08:02:05 BST 2015
@BristolSHS @GabrielScally I'm not sure it's that polite to say she doesn't believe a word we all say and we're all the same... Tue Apr 14 08:00:11 BST 2015

@wordsfromluke you can call me a drab, wet, slimy, pleb if you like (you're such a nice guy) but saying I own lots of homes is defamatory. Sat Apr 11 21:51:30 BST 2015

Our half-time verdict: poor decision by Cameron to choose a 7 a side; they're all ganging up on him and he's struggling. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:04:52 BST 2015
Cameron has nothing at all to say about why he wants another five years in government. Where  the vision? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:58:17 BST 2015
Some good responses to Farage from NS & LC, but only Ed is setting out a future policy platform and vision for government. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:56:02 BST 2015

@NickAnstead @antoniabance actually, to clarify Monday's tweets, it's parliament that decrees such things not EC, but they have Wed Apr 01 13:12:31 BST 2015
@Aurum_Boss yes, more than happy to do so Mon Mar 30 21:58:33 BST 2015
@sophiabotha74 thank you Sophia, enjoy the campaign! Mon Mar 30 20:34:08 BST 2015
@rinka_dog suggest you read my earlier tweets then find something more useful to do Mon Mar 30 16:19:37 BST 2015
@NickAnstead @antoniabance @ian_a_jones I assume so, try EC or IPSA website? Mon Mar 30 12:34:37 BST 2015
@antoniabance @ian_a_jones @NickAnstead was in guidance given to us by EC, I did double and triple check! Mon Mar 30 12:27:52 BST 2015

@glittercrisis but you are right about changing bios - think we have till 5pm tonight for email, etc, to stop working Mon Mar 30 00:40:43 BST 2015
@glittercrisis before you spend any more time on this, Electoral Commission has decreed we can still use MP in Twitter names this time Mon Mar 30 00:39:53 BST 2015
@Mancman10 no, Electoral Commission has decreed we can keep MP in Twitter names this time round. Mon Mar 30 00:33:24 BST 2015
@emwithme I think if I changed Twitter name I'd still keep followers, but people wouldn't know how to find me, so would be a pain Mon Mar 30 00:17:02 BST 2015
“@DrBrianMay: @KerryMP We hope so too, Kerry.  @decencycommon #commondecency  Bri” < thank you Brian! Mon Mar 30 00:15:39 BST 2015

@emwithme Electoral Commission has decreed that we can't use MP in website, email, but can keep twitter names which is helpful. Mon Mar 30 00:07:50 BST 2015
@EiJake thank you Jake! Mon Mar 30 00:05:39 BST 2015

Also significant re E.coli. Scientists say "we are what we eat" #antibioticresistance Tue Mar 24 12:39:02 GMT 2015
For salmonella and campylobacter farm use of antibiotics is the primary cause of resistance in humans. Tue Mar 24 12:38:16 GMT 2015
Routine use of antibiotics on farms masks poor animal husbandry. should only be used on sick animals. #antibioticresistance Tue Mar 24 12:30:14 GMT 2015
The UK needs an #antibiotics reduction strategy that focuses on good animal welfare, not routine medication. #antibioticresistance #saveabx Tue Mar 24 12:26:24 GMT 2015

@pyoor the Bill you mention stands no chance of being debated in parliament, or voted on, so I'd rather focus on what can really be achieved Mon Mar 16 09:49:46 GMT 2015
@pyoor Labour will repeal the Tory/ Lib Dem Health & Social Care Act, and have a ten year plan for the NHS and a national care service. Mon Mar 16 09:48:27 GMT 2015

I said yes, council consultations often are a cosmetic exercise, but now even more determined to #SaveWickRoad, to restore his faith Sun Mar 15 12:46:38 GMT 2015
At #SaveWickRoad meeting a man said to me, consultation a sham, decision already made, & that's why people don't vote or trust politicians.. Sun Mar 15 12:44:53 GMT 2015
@AlanMat22617515 no, it's not - we want to see labour MPs elected in Scotland Sun Mar 15 10:51:10 GMT 2015

@andybolton @KevinBrennanMP I'm far too old to have benefitted from that. All Thatcher's fault. Mon Mar 02 15:51:21 GMT 2015
Just asked about teachers' excessive workloads at Education Qs, as did our shadow Schoolls Minister @KevinBrennanMP. Mon Mar 02 14:51:00 GMT 2015

@eileen_means also need to look at how we can maximise building's use though, eg drop-in services, advice sessions, community hub Sun Mar 01 23:21:17 GMT 2015
@namishmum @eileen_means @RhianGreaves was struck by what I saw about number of kids at Rhyme Time - 66 of them - that's so important Sun Mar 01 23:16:11 GMT 2015
@namishmum there's the epetition, and we've got flyers to hand out at school gates, etc - I'm working with @eileen_means & @RhianGreaves Sun Mar 01 23:13:56 GMT 2015
@garypepworth Yes, sticking to Nikolai would have wiser! Sun Mar 01 22:55:05 GMT 2015
@garypepworth I didn't spot that! Although it's technically accurate isn't it... Sun Mar 01 22:41:23 GMT 2015
@policytessa @paulmizen1 @CLeslieMP there's been quite a bit more since then, eg on apprenticeships for all who get the grades Sun Mar 01 15:16:12 GMT 2015

Excellent article on Nemtsov "three years ago we were an opposition, now we are no more than dissidents" http://t.co/NLcNCSoI7V Sun Mar 01 10:30:23 GMT 2015
Jellyfish causing nuclear power shutdowns. This jellyfish looks like a burger! http://t.co/QznRiSNcGr @Killdozer Sun Mar 01 07:30:34 GMT 2015
Have read so many pieces on Nemtsov's murder in past 24 hours, this by @juliaioffe is one of the best http://t.co/1XJaiuAdHo Sat Feb 28 23:56:25 GMT 2015
And if you have any info or concerns you want to pass on to me re #FindMichaelGraydon pls email. Let's hope he is found safe and well. 2/2 Sat Feb 28 21:37:18 GMT 2015
Re #FindMichaelGraydon, am doing what I can to get right consular advice and support to family in desperately worrying time for them 1/2 Sat Feb 28 21:33:37 GMT 2015
If you have even the smallest bit of information you think could help in the search for Becky, please contact @ASPolice #FindBecky Sat Feb 28 21:12:08 GMT 2015
@tiger8lotus oh right - I thought you must have some kind of super camera attached to a telescope! Sat Feb 28 19:17:27 GMT 2015
@katestew @VegfestUK have just seen your 'vegan ethics in Doctor Who' tweet... Somewhat baffled but now reading links! Sat Feb 28 18:58:44 GMT 2015
@tiger8lotus that's seriously a pic taken in Fishponds tonight? Wow. Sat Feb 28 18:55:28 GMT 2015
@PurbeckPashmina @VegfestUK only a few Tories - eg Zac, Stanley Johnson - and I'd say Prince Charles is along the same lines Sat Feb 28 18:54:51 GMT 2015
@bristolpaul @karinsmyth @JonCraig_Photos it's a bit Chucky doll isn't it Sat Feb 28 18:53:42 GMT 2015
@PurbeckPashmina @VegfestUK which obviously I don't subscribe too, but it's better than the intensive farming version Sat Feb 28 18:51:42 GMT 2015
@PurbeckPashmina @VegfestUK there's a strand of Conservative green thinking which is all about "better" meat, Sat Feb 28 18:50:04 GMT 2015
@bristolpaul @karinsmyth no, @JonCraig_Photos is just very skilful! Although I may be wearing an orange wig by the look of it. Sat Feb 28 18:47:48 GMT 2015
Always thought Caroline Lucas was vegetarian, I've misled many a @VegfestUK audience! http://t.co/zqI54LKwFc Sat Feb 28 18:40:50 GMT 2015
@RealBristolNews @Ian_R_ We often tend to forget we have a council chief executive. Highly paid too. Isn't it her job to ensure competence? Sat Feb 28 18:26:30 GMT 2015
@Mr_GerardCooke acknowledge spending limits will be tight, so what can we do within that? More policy here http://t.co/cwsmzMqLVy Sat Feb 28 18:21:40 GMT 2015
@Mr_GerardCooke we'll inherit current CSR & Ed B has talked of zero-based budget review, ie starting with blank sheet & justifying each item Sat Feb 28 18:20:13 GMT 2015
@dazzter I've been following his career for a long time. At one point I thought he was Russia's best hope... Very shocked by this. Fri Feb 27 22:09:36 GMT 2015
Just seen terrible news that Boris Nemtsov shot dead in front of Kremlin. Fri Feb 27 22:04:33 GMT 2015
@TolpuddleTim it was good but not mind-blowing - the Troxy gig was stunning, this one was a bit sedate by comparison. How about you? Fri Feb 27 22:01:38 GMT 2015
@TolpuddleTim I recall turning up at Croyde Bay around midnight to see a packed dance floor for the Strawbs. I very sensibly retired to bed! Fri Feb 27 21:55:13 GMT 2015
@RealBristolNews we've been trying to find out what application covered the tree-felling - now we know the answer! Fri Feb 27 21:51:28 GMT 2015
@bbb69 it's been a good day today, had little kids reading to me at Air Balloon and bigger ones getting politically engaged at St Brendans. Fri Feb 27 21:46:38 GMT 2015
@bbb69 started at 8 with radio interview, then school visit, hustings at sixth form, surgery, office time, residents meeting, just got in! Fri Feb 27 21:30:20 GMT 2015
@MasonMasonwill @StBrendansSFC @UKLabour thanks, I enjoyed it! Great to see so many students say they're going to vote. Fri Feb 27 21:28:48 GMT 2015
At final meeting of the day, with group of St George residents talking about an anti-social behaviour problem on their street. Fri Feb 27 20:13:51 GMT 2015
@marleybennett @tdebbonaire oh, I just went with autopredict! Fri Feb 27 19:21:18 GMT 2015
Tories flocking to vote Lib Dem to stop the red menace (aka @tdebonnaire) http://t.co/9TauE8J5Ho Fri Feb 27 18:57:10 GMT 2015
@AM_HC actually the only yellow in a 4-page leaflet is on the "can't win here" bar chart showing a Labour/ Lib Dem battle. Fri Feb 27 18:50:40 GMT 2015
Another day,  another Bristol West Lib Dem leaflet. Apparently we now need up save the NHS. Why's that then? http://t.co/6SGPimlNtT Fri Feb 27 18:45:45 GMT 2015
Great interview with @MichaelDugher on Labour's transport priorities https://t.co/vBUuqnpzm5 Fri Feb 27 09:21:25 GMT 2015
@bbb69 yes, that's what we've all been saying! Fri Feb 27 09:20:08 GMT 2015
@lloydwatkin @bbcrb @EastvillePark traffic flow/ congestion not the issue here - it's when traffic can move fast - they won't use P&R Fri Feb 27 09:10:41 GMT 2015
@guid0man @johnrobb77 @simontucker1979 agree, but with something like You Trip Me Up you want it to be phenomenally loud Fri Feb 27 09:00:11 GMT 2015
@guid0man @simontucker1979 in a way I quite liked being able to hear songs not noise, but was "good" rather than mind-blowing like Troxy Fri Feb 27 08:37:56 GMT 2015
@bbcrb @mthrel ah right, better than some who try to pronounce the h! Fri Feb 27 08:33:59 GMT 2015
@mthrel just done @bbcrb about M32 safety barrier. They sent me their notes from earlier this week, which say Mhairi - pronounced M-eye-ree! Fri Feb 27 08:31:49 GMT 2015
@iBristolPeople policy wise there are "nudge" ways to change behaviour, but in the end it's down to everyone respecting their neighbourhood Fri Feb 27 05:11:55 GMT 2015
@iBristolPeople wider issues: landlords' responsibility (growing number rented properties), mobile CCTV to catch fly tippers, bin provision Fri Feb 27 05:09:15 GMT 2015
@iBristolPeople it's not really about policy, more about action by council - @mthrel & @CllrMKhan constantly asking BCC to clean up 1/2 Fri Feb 27 05:06:18 GMT 2015
@dickiesview pleasure to meet you too. Yes I did - not anywhere near as loud as Troxy but in some ways that was a bit of a relief! Did you? Thu Feb 26 23:15:35 GMT 2015
Good to have @GabrielScally at tonight's meeting talking about @LabourHealth policy. Thu Feb 26 20:00:04 GMT 2015
@bbb69 @TheMaryChain I'm doing @bbcrb tomorrow morning, I'm a bit worried I'll end up shouting because I can't hear myself! Thu Feb 26 19:36:33 GMT 2015
@MmeGuillotine @TheMaryChain I thought it would be former rather than latter. Shame! Thu Feb 26 18:28:14 GMT 2015
@MmeGuillotine @TheMaryChain do you have childcare responsibilities, or doesn't he let you out without him?! Thu Feb 26 18:24:21 GMT 2015
So who in Bristol is going to @TheMaryChain tonight? I have a Labour meeting first, but will just about make it! Thu Feb 26 18:21:34 GMT 2015
@ACFAAdvice @NBACBristol that's good - lots going on in Bristol, good if it's reaching people in food poverty too Thu Feb 26 15:37:28 GMT 2015
@JaneCouchMBE @GeorgeFergusonx @ASPolice @David_Cameron will give family all the help they can - but not via Twitter, as you will understand Thu Feb 26 13:23:53 GMT 2015
@JaneCouchMBE @GeorgeFergusonx @ASPolice @David_Cameron yes, have been doing working on it, in touch with family, got lots of info Thu Feb 26 13:23:05 GMT 2015
@drjonesaa I'm sorry, seen your emails, but you need to look to your own MP. Parliamentary rules, plus I have such a lot of my own at moment Thu Feb 26 12:48:11 GMT 2015
@HollieGraydon making enquiries, would rather keep you updated by email, if that's ok with you - but rest assured, trying to do what I can Thu Feb 26 12:07:42 GMT 2015
@katejerrold let me have a look at that! Thu Feb 26 11:57:44 GMT 2015
In the chamber for statement on Jimmy Savile NHS Investigations. Scale of his abuse and total impunity are unbelievable. House very sombre. Thu Feb 26 11:43:56 GMT 2015
“@hopeformen: http://t.co/smJVKwH8S8” < Can't RT in full cos *swearing* but yes, do we really have to explain this all over again? Really? Thu Feb 26 10:51:45 GMT 2015
Culture Sec says he used to frequent @FleeceBristol in his youth; he or @edvaizey will try to drop in at my @VenueTrust event March 9th. Thu Feb 26 10:15:53 GMT 2015
@BIGPICNIC_FFLP thanks, it's on my Twitter bio Thu Feb 26 07:59:37 GMT 2015

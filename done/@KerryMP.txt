@KerryMP
@oliverhumpage Govt will try to block at money resolution stage as they did with bedroom tax - need public pressure to ensure it proceeds.
#SaveOurNHS bill passed this stage by 241 votes to 18. Govt will use backdoor mechanisms to block it rather than turning out today.
So - we voted yes to having a vote, so now we're having a vote. #saveourhns
OK, so this is a vote on a closure motion - ie we're voting that we should end the debate and have a vote. It's not THE vote on the Bill.
Here's my article for today's @BristolPost about the #saveourNHS vote today   
http://t.co/GjtylC6eQ0
"The spineless MPs of a disintegrating Government... who haven't got the guts to come here today" says @andyburnhammp #saveourNHS
@bbb69 @simon_price01 @theQuietus it's funny, I thought exactly the same - Miriam Margolyes! But I thought Jim looked great.
David Tredinnick now going on about homeopathy and acupuncture, but I think @andyburnhammp is next...
@simon_price01 @theQuietus I mean it - and I agree with you about You Trip Me Up being their finest moment. It's in my Desert Island Discs.
Absolutely brilliant review of Wednesday's Jesus and Mary Chain gig by @Simon_Price01 for @thequietus http://t.co/OZya6ON0qb …
@amnestybristol @bigade1665 Will definitely try - but can you email me? Not allowed to do diary via Twitter - it never works!
I'd have thought Douglas Carswell would have been in the Chamber for his UKIP colleague's maiden speech. Although it's not very good.
@swilliamsmp @CherylMorgan @GeorgeFergusonx And I would echo that. I think real progress has been made on trans issues this year.
@jamesoflynn @HouseofTwitsLab And again, you have a point! The Government hates 38 degrees because it helps public hold them to account.
@jamesoflynn @HouseofTwitsLab Was quite frustrating at time of Health & Social Care Act that public wasn't as alert to risk as they are now.
@jamesoflynn @HouseofTwitsLab Well you sort of have a point, but we've been working to get the bandwagon on the road for a long time!
My only quarrel with John Healey is that he's let Lib Dems off the hook. Wouldn't have happened without their support. Where are they today?
Now it's John Healey, former Labour health minister, outlining chaos Tories caused with biggest top down reorganisation of NHS in 65 years.
Sam Austin from Bristol died out in Thailand. Friends are fundraising to bring his body home. Pls support http://t.co/WaWJElq00H
@allyska We're the ones yawning, after 25 minutes from Sir Tony Baldry... and he's just the warm-up act for the Filibuster Three.
Btw, Clive Efford isn't in his usual place today, as the two UKIP MPs came and sat next to him, so he had to move!
Tory MPs saying Labour just jumping on 38 degrees bandwagon. Clive's bill came before the emails, & Labour opposed Health & Social Care Act,
Confirmation from @CliveEfford that his #SaveOurNHS bill would protect the NHS from #TTIP.
@BristolRed She was prepared to rebel on pubs, but not on NHS. Saving pubs is good, but surely saving NHS is far more important.
Well that was Dennis Skinner at his very best.
Usual suspects from Tories - Nuttall, PD and Chope - here to try to talk bill out. Virtually no other Tories or Lib Dems. #SaveOurNHS
@BristolRed Charlotte's line on this is so disingenuous. Her party is hellbent on destroying NHS, and she calls for cross-party consensus!
@allyska my nephews, UWE students, love megabus! Labour will be out in force, but Govt might wheel out troops to oppose.
Just to confirm, yes I will definitely be in Parliament to #saveournhs today. But it needs other Bristol MPs there too.
@wronginbristol @bbcrb @sumountstevens the chief constable?
Will be on @bbcrb at 8.20 talking about second anniversary of Avon PCC, no doubt followed by "and while we've got you here..."
@OliGGriffin yes I'm here/ there, depending on your perspective
@BristolSHS don't worry I'll be there to vote. I also have Q2 at health Qs on Tuesday asking specifically about student health services.
@allyska yes, but already in London - no need for megabus at crack of dawn!
Email from constituent "slightly late I know, but I'm sure megabus have last minute tickets" - wants me in London for #savethenhs vote.
@THEbazzaevans their line is to decry us as being same as Tories - tomorrow's NHS vote is very good illustration that we're not!
@THEbazzaevans I hate the way the Greens dismiss Labour's role as the most progressive force in British politics over past century
@wurlyburgh @Ed_Miliband check out what @tomgreatrexmp said today about Ineos. And there's a debate on Tuesday.
As I meant to say... @Ed_Miliband said not acting on #climatechange ultimately far more costly #greenerbritain
@bristol_citizen @Ed_Miliband oops, yes!
And Ed says you can't be serious about tackling #climatechange if you're not serious about our place in EU. @GreenAllianceUK
Good stuff from @Ed_Miliband on how devolving power to cities & regions should include power to tackle environmental issues.
At @GreenAllianceUK 35th birthday party. @Ed_Miliband, former #climatechange secretary, making an important speech.
@THEbazzaevans well I think my party is worth voting for too! But move to Bristol, it's cool,
Replying to hundreds of emails, confirming I will be in parliament to vote to #savethenhs  tomorrow http://t.co/geYRNj3qFr
@iBristolPeople like waste & recycling... I had to explain that it was actually of great interest to some constituents!
@iBristolPeople had an email from a constituent the other day, asking why was I asking Qs about things that didn't affect people in Bristol
@iBristolPeople thanks, but make that green with a small G!
@salvey1 @kav_kaushik three vegan MPs, all Labour, and have been quite a few vegetarian Labour cabinet ministers but no vegan yet AFAIK.
Last night I tagged along with friends to see Bonnie Prince Billy in Hackney. I don't really get it. I especially don't get the beards.
It's been nearly thirty years since I last saw them, at Liverpool Uni, so very excited about seeing the Jesus and Mary Chain tonight!
@polblonde I know... I was very disappointed. Unfortunately I had to leave before it got to the Q&A part or I'd have pressed them on it.
@polblonde But they urged MPs to vote against EAW today as it could be used against Assange, who they'd spent the afternoon with at embassy,
@polblonde Nadya & Masha from Pussy Riot in Parliament yesterday. They didn't get much time to speak, as lots of other speakers first...
@oliverhumpage if I wasn't  aware the 117 emails I received last night would certainly have prompted me. Yes, will be there.
At a Fabian arts policy seminar. (Lord) Chris Smith has cited Hartcliffe Boys Dance Co. as a great community project. Anyone remember it?
@hannahmatica Looks like you've got a ticket now? One of my spectacularly useless friends has just cancelled on us!
Government defeated on new clause 2 to Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, on pubs.
@hannahmatica Afraid not.
@punkchester Will leave it with the doorkeepers. I have managed to leave my phone behind today, to make things even more complicated!
@punkchester I've just realised Pussy Riot event goes on till 8, so I'll be staying till the end of that. Friends going for 7.30 though.
@punkchester I'll bring tickets in with me, and give you yours so you can decide whether you want to pop home first or whatever.
@punkchester one friend is coming from Oxford, one from Luton so not sure where to suggest meeting them. I have all the tickets.
@punkchester well I'm captive till the 7pm vote, so will be heading off straight from work. You too presumably?
@punkchester Er, nice pic. Are you still ok for tomorrow?
@tiger8lotus Is that a riddle? Nice pics....
@JMarkDodds @LSL_Campaign I'm afraid I don't have much control over the Tory whips!
@uwebusiness @AlexJamesFitz Jimbelung?
@setsquared Sorry I'm already fully booked - in fact double-booked! - for the 26th. Hope it goes well.
.@LSL_Campaign Yes, I'm supporting New Clause 2 tomorrow.
@Theres_Treasure @the_vaselines @theklabristol Yes, I enjoyed it. I like the noisier ones best!
@Redpeter99 @PeazM Very good.
I like this one http://t.co/AncyTn9Bqs
Apparently it's from an advert. http://t.co/AncyTn9Bqs
@ACE_Lindsay Was that intentional? I could think of lots of car songs. Dave Edmonds Crawling from the Wreckage is a good one.
"@bigreggie09  @KerryMP you could be listening to worse music." < I really couldn't. Unless they played 4 Non Blondes too.
@RhodaMacdonald done
@gavinshuker I did suggest that to her! She muttered something about spiky hair and blushed...
And it's back again after only a two song intermission (Happy and something about hear me roar). Worst song ever.
@bradleybristol Not sure, @mthrel will know.
3 mobile reckon I spent 2 hours on phone to my mum from El Salvador in September. As she will tell you, I don't even call when I'm at home!
@pazman1973 Someone is now singing about the eye of the tiger and how I'm gonna hear her roar. Probably very famous.
Bad enough 3 mobile trying to charge me £238 for calls I didn't make, without making me listen to We Built This City On Rock'nRoll on hold.
@andy_s_morris on the case, trying to sort it...
@RealBristolNews yes, I've had mountains of info re this via email - I'm not going to even attempt to dissect it via Twitter!
@Marshadecordova @bristolcouncil David is my constituent, I think he raises some valid questions...
@daisy_elli @swilliamsmp I don't think there's anything in that link that most MPs don't already understand, must have been way Qs put.
@daisy_elli @swilliamsmp how many MPs actually took part in that survey?
@ElectriCheese @AlexJamesFitz that's what I reckon too
The Imitation Game was excellent. Benedict Cumberbatch very good in it.
@cazziemacca ah, I know who you are now! Vaselines were good tonight...
@BevaniteEllie is that you and Bal doing your Baccara routine?
@veganbristol @bo_novak but the veg ramen is OK? Without the egg?
@bo_novak @veganbristol I would in a normal place but don't in places like wagamama where things are marked vegetarian, just ask about egg.
@bo_novak @veganbristol but if marked vegetarian it shouldn't have fish in it - I thought that sort of place would be clued up about that!
@veganbristol they have a number of dishes marked vegetarian! The ramen has half a boiled egg in if but can do it without...
@BevaniteEllie and then I'm going home and having a mug of cocoa.
@chickdastardly as I said, we has a good chat. And no-one uses New Labour anymore - you're still in the 90s!
Very late lunch in @sticksnbroth then off to @wshed to see Imitation Game, then @theklabristol for @the_vaselines. http://t.co/Ul4zCxs6Y6
@chickdastardly Harley? I spoke to his female owner, had a good chat.
Dog outside Mina Road post office with David Bowie eyes. http://t.co/04x8H4sqWk
This looks like I have a new job - sandwich board person. #backthebill #6monthstowin http://t.co/4KhuYcweXQ
Have also discovered that the community cafe at the food bank does #vegan chocolate & coconut cake. Post-street stall reward!
Very encouraging response from people on St Mark's Road to our #backthebill petition. I will be voting this Friday to save the NHS.
Big crowd at Broad Street's Palestine Museum for the first screening of @Scriptonite's film.
Just recorded interview for tonight's Points West about shocking final cost of #badgercull. £5200 per dead badger. What a waste.
@ianjmatt  aggresive tax avoidance may not be illegal but it's certainly unethical
@ianjmatt @abelardinelli Difficult to do that when new avoidance schemes keep being invented - can close loopholes, but new ones are found.
@daisy_elli In 140 characters? Not really... I've had 4 or 5 emails from constituents on it, will reply to them in detail.
@SteveHutsonCGE yes, it does mean you have to behave. I'll be watching you very closely from now on.
@CarlLoben yes, they're at Amnesty HQ in London tomorrow night and in Parliament Tuesday. Not sure what else they're up to.
@KerryPollard_ @stewartwood when i met with ARC, was very struck by stats on how much a tax inspector brings in - false economy to cut staff
@oliverhumpage @stewartwood it's repaying all the tax and then up to 100% fine on top, but I see it could be misconstrued..
@laurencehaydock me too...
@GreatStrides65 @cfaware @uklabour @andyburnhammp what I meant was, public reporting/ campaigning misses out the detail, our policy doesn't
@JohnRentoul I had 500+ emails on it & I'm sure some of them shop in Tesco. Now having serious impact on charities. So it is important!
@djwood247 although the mayor might then have had a conflict of interest! Are you in that line of work?
Have only just had time now to look at reports mentioned in last RT. Gross indeed, but also quite alarming. http://t.co/GMNPSG0U2h
@GreatStrides65 @cfaware @uklabour @andyburnhammp somewhat inevitable in politics, but I take your point!
@KerryMP @cfaware @greatstrides65 @uklabour @andyburnhammp but @Debbie_abrahams outlines some concerns here http://t.co/73c0sjOOON
@CFAware @greatstrides65 @uklabour @andyburnhammp I should add - Labour supported national specialised commissioning when Bill introduced
@CharlieBGP shame they require people to register and give personal details
@LabourCND @uklabour @dalexandermp @spellar certainly very interesting that US has decided to go...
“@HelenGoodmanMP: culture savings made at expense of regions  by national institutions http://t.co/Cd2Ha3twNR" < disappointing for Bristol
@daisy_elli I've been aware of positive money campaign for some time but remain unconvinced, so think climate change debate more important.
@daisy_elli not sure yet if I'm in Parliament then, but if I am I'll be in the Westminster Hall on the IPCC report on climate change
@Hibaq_Jama @georgefergusonx @swilliamsmp @helenhbristol also perhaps more general point about hiring consultants without open competition?
@whittakerwells it was lovely to meet you, and good to see a new - and stylish! - business doing so well.
@RealBristolNews @bristolcouncil I've had some very long emails on this... It does seem there are questions to be answered
@ss_diabetes @wdd will give it a try - I don't have much sugar as a rule, but will be interesting to see how much it crops up in things
@bbb69 I'm seeing them at the Troxy next Wednesday, but that looks tempting...
@BristolChess @schoolschess it was great to meet you, and see the kids getting so into it. Will have to return when they're experts!
@GreatStrides65 @UKLabour @CFAware We're not changing commissioning services - CCGs at local level - it's about resisting privatisation.
@CFAware @GreatStrides65 @UKLabour @andyburnhammp You're wrong, this has been Labour policy since the Bill was introduced and we opposed.
@GreatStrides65 @CFAware @UKLabour  @andyburnhammp I think if you listen to the debate this Friday you will realise this isn't the case.
Had a great time at Summerhill School this morning, watching a Year 4 #ChessInSchools class and having a quick game. http://t.co/vRDm6kil7T
@fbreckels @DowdingSean what's your email address Sean? I have some info for you. Mine is on my twitter bio, or you can DM it to me.
Apparently a UKIP call centre near Cribbs Causeway is recruiting. Wonder what attitude Job Centre would take if a JSA claimant refused?
@fbreckels @DowdingSean it's in the Lords at the moment, so I'd have to check out what's been happening there
@CheneyCraig you're not normal Craig.
@CheneyCraig as one journalist put it, if you think you know what's going on, you're not paying enough attention
@AlecShelbrooke So what was it you said to Yvette Cooper that the Speaker described as "exceptionally ignorant"? I didn't catch it.
@AvonFBU Saw Jacko yesterday & he said I hadn't yet signed the prayer on pensions. Just checked & definitely have! Name added 6th November.
@charcharcatpig well I went vegetarian soon after that... and I like dill pickle now!
@charcharcatpig I have only once had a McDonalds burger and I didn't like the pickles. Many years ago, in Milton Keynes.
I will post his reply later as I have no idea what he said. It was a bit of a yeah but, no but, search me guv answer.
Asked Pickles about McDonalds in Fishponds and whether local councils should be able to reject fast food outlets near schools.
@yrotitna @38_degrees I very much doubt US corporates want to run British libraries! NHS is where the profits (potentially) are.
@BristolAnna depends on what US is prepared to discuss within #  negotiations - I'd have thought that at this early stage, worth a shot?
@BristolAnna I would like agreements with US to improve standards on environment, labour, animal welfare - whether TTIP is right vehicle
@38_degrees of course we need to protect public services but NHS is totemic and where US corporates most likely to be interested.
@BristolAnna for a Fair Globalisation will be basis of their initial position. And you've just heard about sustainability assessment.
@BristolAnna EU has said that 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Rights & Principles at Work & the 2008 ILO Declaration on Social Justice
@RuthKrabacher that was me. May have spoken in shorthand but point I was trying to make was that US has not ratified core ILO conventions.
Rather stunning setting for #TTIP debate, at Wills Memorial Building. Several hundred people here. http://t.co/7l5sCGeiKf
@swilliamsmp it's eased off a bit... meeting  at cenotaph, I assume? No point rehearsing the walk down...
@swilliamsmp seems to me the wreath-laying practice not a good idea in this weather?
@punkchester almost missed this, so many tweets tonight - it's yours if you want it!
@BenMosley oh that's a relief! Have only just emerged from Tube so was worried you'd have no way of getting hold of me of stranded.
@joskinner2 @BenMosley is that what I tweeted?!
But Hero of the Year award quite rightly goes to the very brave Pepe Julian Onziema, #LGBT activist from Uganda.
The ultra-cool Ellen Page is also short listed.
Last award of the evening is fit Hero of the Year. I suspect many in the audience are hoping for a Tom Daley victory, including @BenMosley.
@Saralimback @allyska looks like we need to lobby @wshed to re-run it!
Broadcast of the Year is won by Pride, to much applause. I'm the only person who hasn't seen it yet.
Well deserved,Journalist of the Year to Liz Mackean who made the Dispatches "Hunted" about violence against #LGBT community in Russia .
Should add, Lynne Featherstone was joint winner of Politician of the Year for her work on equal marriage.
.@mcashmancbe accepts his award from @ed_milibamd and talks about his new role as international #LGBT envoy. http://t.co/KHhw6iJ8wD
Me and @benmosley are sitting behind @ed_miliband and the man I hope wins instead of me tonight, @mcashmancbe http://t.co/x7Rn7vFVre
So we are at the Stonewall Awards at the V&A. I have been nominated for Politician of the Year. Not going to win but nice to make shortlist.
@kiramadeira @darrenpjones @BenMosley @husseybyname Ben has been known to do a rendition of Sex Bomb after a drink or two, but not me.
@darrenpjones @BenMosley @kiramadeira @husseybyname we're at the Stonewall Awards. No tweed here!
On a night out with @BenMosley We're bidding to be the new @kiramadeira & @husseybyname We're about to enter the V&A http://t.co/V1kT1Pzm7i
@AnimalRightsUK @floellaella Whereas MPs who sign every EDM going, but do absolutely zilch else, will look great!
@AnimalRightsUK @floellaella If this is based on EDMs MPs like me - frontbenchers who can't sign EDMs - will score zero.
Tickets for Bonnie Prince Billy at Hackney Church Tuesday 18th have arrived. I have one spare. Any takers?
@iBristolPeople @johndarvall @bbcrb but yes I would still be arguing for proper consultation  and accountability, at all levels.
@iBristolPeople @johndarvall @bbcrb @MarvinJRees wouldn't have behaved like Bristol was his personal fiefdom
@BenMosley @benjaminbutter you can't do tweed when you come up to town, Biggins! No brown shoes either!
@simmo050 should do, I emailed Simeon last Thursday. Will check.
@johndarvall @bbcrb Devolution of power to cities is needed but need to get local accountability right too - can't give it all to one man.
This may put the John Lewis ad in a different light http://t.co/4PMZkYBwNl I have warned you about penguins before.
I asked Energy Sec why, if @OVOEnergy pass on falling energy costs to customers, can't Big Six do the same - he suggested switching to Ovo.
@PraiseTheLoud Yes, couldn't agree more!
And that was my 4th question of the morning - @OVOEnergy will be pleased with the Energy Secretary's response!
Just called for a debate on devolution of power to cities, eg on transport & housing. Good answer from Hague. I'm having a busy morning!
Obviously with Avonmouth plant there were other concerns too, but I know many concerned about bigger picture too, ie how "green" is biomass.
Also got a chance to ask Secretary of State about biomass plants, and how to ensure sustainability - ie only waste not virgin wood used.
All the MPs in greater Bristol area - except me and Dawn - voted against it. None of them spoke in debate. Poor show.
Yesterday Labour called debate on giving cities London-style powers to develop more integrated, frequent, cheaper and greener bus services.
@BenMosley ask @benjaminbutter, he's a far better style guru than I could ever be!
Ed Davey rebukes the 5 Labour MPs coming in on Q1 for not congratulating him on EU deal. Not a single Tory or Lib Dem said a word!
Just asked at DECC Qs about non-binding EU renewable targets & what Govt will do to use this flexibility to increase low carbon programme.
@tiger8lotus unemployed people have lives too - caring responsibilities, kids to get to school, doctor's appointments.
@tiger8lotus no, I'm seeing sanctions applied when perfectly reasonable cause shown - they have targets. Easy to say get an earlier bus...
@deadlydarcy wasn't asked...
@simmo050 did it a week ago
@hugepeg Or does that relate to your earlier tweet about a recipe book? I find it hard to believe anything vegan in there!
@hugepeg would you send pictures of pork pies to a Muslim?
@Max_Morris in Fishponds Road 95% of on-street sex workers are addicted to hard drugs - medical not criminal intervention only answer.
Chloe Smith says that councils whose bus funding budgets have been slashed by central government need to "man up!"
@SWLabourParty Let them ride mopeds!
(Rather odd reply, suggesting they be given mopeds.)
Intervened on Tory MP to raise problem of people being sanctioned by job centres when unreliable buses mean they're late for appointments.
Louise Ellman, Chair of Transport Select Committee, says isolation due to poor public transport is not just a rural issues. Very true.
@zelo_street seems to be getting worse in recent months - twitter and my inbox full of complaints.
@Max_Morris thanks for info, Max. I lobbied our Police & Crime Commissioner to support Ugly Mugs campaign and she said she would.
Just made a plea to Transport Secretary for DfT to listen to concerns of @RethinkMetrobus & others, to ensure taxpayers money well spent.
@hugepeg Plenty of meat alternatives. You can get vegan black pudding and vegan haggis these days, but not sure why anyone would.
@hugepeg The Sandringham in Sandy Park Road. I very politely declined.
@hugepeg I was in a pub into constituency the other day that has bowls of free chitlins on the bar. You should visit.
.@hugepeg they were also offering a pork and sage burger with streaky bacon today - that's almost the same?
@DorsetRachel can't see any of those you mentioned
@OliGGriffin actually mostly Tory!
In chamber for debate on local bus services. Given the dire situation in Bristol it's a shame no other Bristol area MPs are here.
@Official_MRLP No I didn't and you're every bit as predictable as those who make vegan jokes.
Today's #vegan month option in parliament - quinoa spring rolls with broccoli and udon noodles. http://t.co/Y2PKXCOKIK
Have arranged a public meeting 6pm, this Friday at the New Place, Fishponds Rd, with police, etc, to discuss on-street prostitution in area.
Local MPs Jack Lopresti, Chris Skidmore & me ask Business Minister about threat of job losses for our constituents who work at Rolls Royce.
In chamber for UQ on Rolls Royce job losses. Many of my constituents work there, or in supply chain.
Asked International Development Secretary about climate justice. Answer implies UK won't back it as standalone Sustainable Development Goal.
@eastonruth sorry, as a frontbencher I can't sign EDMs but you're right about issue - sadly many people think they get much more.
@nemof @GreenRobTelford rather than saying TTIP good/ TTIP bad - when we don't know what TTIP end of 2015 model will be
@nemof @GreenRobTelford that was my point yesterday - at this negotiating stage focus should be on content, making sure ISDS not in there
@nemof @GreenRobTelford but from what I'm told,  opposition from a number of states means ISDS unlikely to make it into treaty.
@WideOpenVoices @SilentNo_Longer I wasn't aware of the appointment, what has Kelly been hired to do?
@SubPolitics @ChriswMP and @cathyjamieson
@GreenRobTelford @rosiebytheshore you asked what the current Labour position is, and I have told you. Shouldn't have indulged you.
@GreenRobTelford PS if you think TTIP is simple, you really don't know enough about it - as do none of us, yet
@GreenRobTelford I grew out of badge-wearing a long time ago...
Iʼve voted for People’s Plant Collection to win a £120k #GrowWild transformation. Vote now! #voteGWBristol/ http://t.co/fZpNQWZsjo
@GreenRobTelford that's enough answers for you for tonight... See you Saturday!
@GreenRobTelford but it's all very early stages - will be negotiated throughout 2015 - vote Labour or the Tories will sign away the NHS!
@GreenRobTelford generally Labour would support opening up trade - if more jobs, investment, etc, but as I've said, concerns re TTIP
@GreenRobTelford which are in danger of getting lost amongst other concerns... I spoke on this in 0.7% Bill debate - not re TTIP but CAFTA
@GreenRobTelford for starters... And I've recently started talking to environmental & animal welfare groups about wider ramifications
@GreenRobTelford I'm always consistent! Labour has concerns about NHS/ public services - see Andy Burnham's efforts on this - and ISDS...
@profsarahchilds @ukparliament @spaisbristol hope the students enjoyed it, and found it educational too
@livehotaction only for a month... and not my idea (but quite possibly the result of gentle persuasion by the 3 vegan MPs over the years)
@GreenRobTelford you'll have to come along on Saturday won't you...
Was really interesting to talk to @DrdomThompson today - from Bristol Uni - about how young people's health needs aren't prioritised.
@DrdomThompson great to meet you too - our conversation really made me think. And you should definitely meet @GabrielScally.
@JDKaile I did a World Vegan Day adjournment debate in 2011 and all the Tory/ Lib Dem fathers stayed late just to heckle me! Was very odd.
@JDKaile yes, we're grateful to find one thing we can eat; they can always eat everything!
@JDKaile They get very angry for no reason at all. No-ones stopping them doing anything.
@JDKaile just because I tweeted we should put it in members' lobby (as a salutary reminder to others...)
@JDKaile last week the Mail ran a piece saying I was calling for taxpayers' money to be spent on Grayson Perry's Chris Huhne vase...
@JDKaile @standardnews I won't bother reading that. (Actually there's a copy on seat next to me on bus & still won't!) Heard it all before.
@tollycobbold @bbcrb @johndarvall I've asked for a meeting with the new MD of First, but reregulation may be only hope.
@BenMosley if you're lucky there might be chips! on Thursday. It says "bowl food", whatever that it. PS don't wear tweed.
At @MeningitisNow reception, listening to youth ambassadors and the head of student health at Bristol Uni. #TimeIsNOW
@Pop_Pendleton @daily_politics @reporterboy I was going to add that - Harry Ramsden's use beef dripping I think - but not enough characters.
Here's the Daily Politics #vegan clip, with delicious food provided by Lenny of Vantra in Oxford Street. http://t.co/UeCiyUwHAP
@daily_politics @reporterboy I was making the point it's not all lentils and salad - chips are vegan unless cooked in lard!
Good to see @marcthevet in the public gallery!
Just been talking to Bristol Uni students, now in @ChriswMP debate on this year's #badger culls.
The Daily Politics piece on #vegans got rather squeezed but we recorded some extra minutes for the website, which I'll tweet when it's up.
@HanneChalk I'm trying to get a meeting with First Bus. If you want to email me about your bus service, will raise with him.
Have also asked for a meeting with new MD of First Bus. Any constituents want to drop me an email about bus problems, will add to dossier.
@patrickjbutler @francescrook I agree, for what it's worth. Horrific crime but rules exist for a reason. Look at aftermath of Bulger case.
Just did radio Bristol on BRT/ Metrobus and why I'll be meeting the Transport Minister and @GeorgeFergusonx to ask for a rethink.
@OVOEnergy @marcocondren @MaxVeglio sometimes Max needs reminding who's boss...
@adrianprobert3 important here too - big impact on public health.  And we have a role to play in reducing emissions too.
@KevinMorton1966 very good.
@adrianprobert3 There's lots of very good research out there - happy to debate with you when you've read it and are better-informed.
@adrianprobert3 It's cheaper, a better use of scarce resources, would end global hunger, and less environmental impact. Not trivial.
Just found out that Lenny from Vantra will also be taking part in the Daily Politics vegan piece tomorrow. and bringing food....
@OVOEnergy @marcocondren @MaxVeglio It wasn't me who vetoed the photo - it was Max and Mark!
@KevinMorton1966 Loads... tho' she's only a Mogg by marriage, and not called Mogg. Don't you remember the Mogg's sister who stood in 2010?
@56Batt @OMKingy No, I'm going to block you, as I do everyone who uses that #.
@KevinMorton1966 Did you know his niece is standing against me in the General Election? I'm being Mogged!
Someone - @OMKingy - wants to interview me about bringing back drinking water fountains for Bristol 2015. What do you think?
@OMKingy @swilliamsmp @bgreencapital @CLeslieMP I'm at a funeral on Friday in London, but will try to arrange a phone call
@OVOEnergy @marcocondren I did have my pic taken too but the consensus was I looked like a serial killer so I used Mark +@maxveglio instead.
@kathgreenwood I had a conversation ith her and was unconvinced that she'd thought details through, and that it was genuinely about SSA.
In DWP Qs, possibly going to ask two Qs... Definitely got a topical and also got Q15 on in-work poverty, if we get to it.
@AdamSButler65 He's a schnauzer. He's adorable.
@Redveee oh no, I love taking him for walks - he's not mine, I only get to see him when I'm visiting and he knows he'll get a long walk!
Rain had stopped and Teddy is dropping hints http://t.co/nbOKj0HCG2
@AwayWont and you did! Thanks x
Waiting for the rain to stop. We're not going out in this weather. http://t.co/14qCNXJRL0
@BristolRed @bristol_citizen @bristolpost it's how IPCC works - they investigate then refer to CPS if criminal or police internal if not.
@bristol_citizen @bristolpost if they'd asked me I'd have said PCC has a duty to take complaints seriously - but they didn't.
@bristol_citizen @mikeofbristol @georgefergusonx but should find out from DfT on 26th what scope there is now to request changes.
@bristol_citizen @mikeofbristol @georgefergusonx Trying to find out what efforts BCC made to seek permission from DfT to alter scheme.
@bristol_citizen @mikeofbristol @georgefergusonx but that doesn't excuse general lack of communication over this issue...
@bristol_citizen @mikeofbristol @georgefergusonx no, it was a serious family issue for someone else who needed to be at the meeting...
@mikeofbristol @bristol_citizen @georgefergusonx I'm told there was a good reason this time, but shame we can't reschedule sooner.
@arryTuttle @bristol_citizen @mark_bradshaw this meeting is about the discussions has had/ hasn't had with DfT in past year.
@DanthebeemanBee well you've delighted me for long enough, as Mr Bennett would say.
@bristol_citizen I was supposed to meet George yesterday to discuss BRT. Cancelled day before, now on November 28th. Meeting minister 26th.
@DanthebeemanBee I meant Osborne but could equally apply to Ferguson. Both as bad with figures.
@DanthebeemanBee @GabrielScally and suggest you look at research just released by @anncoffeymp.
@DanthebeemanBee PS 13,586 is not "remarkably similar" to 1400. It's 10x more. Have you been taking maths lessons from George?
@DanthebeemanBee @GabrielScally suggest you check out what new South Yorks PCC has said and remarkable campaigning by @SarahChampionMP
@DanthebeemanBee @GabrielScally what a stupid crass thing to say.
@RoTheBot @GabrielScally Gabriel's tweet said they were mostly from London, but do you mean a detention/ removal centre in St Paul's?

Good to meet with Ovo Energy. They're backing 1625ip's #brizzz @sleepout next week. I got @marcocondren to pose, http://t.co/2VSFAAWQDC
@FishpondsGFNP Quite often there will be fish sauce in Thai curry sauces, so they'll have to avoid that too.
Here's one of the recipes from World #Vegan Month in Parliament - http://t.co/8Z3UqZ5OVp
Just drove past @mightyfoodfight. If I hadn't been stuck in Temple Way traffic I'd have done a quick detour for some #vegan goodies.
@FishpondsGFNP That took me so long to suss out what you were on about... If they start doing a tofu green curry I'll pay them a visit!
@RobCrewsHole @troopershill constituent has emailed about lack of swings, etc, in play area - is thai something FOTH would be interested in?
@BristolRed I just had to explain who she was to @marcocondren

The Pumpkin Festival runs till 9th November. More info on http://t.co/LFZ3rJyyBT #pumpkinrescue @ http://t.co/N1OH8yudZo
At the Oxford Pumpkin Festival, hearing about great things the city is doing on food surplus. We should have one in Bristol next year.
@BristolTips @TheBristolCable No... now following, will check it out. Thanks for letting me know.
Interesting piece on Bristol Green Capital and whether it can reach out beyond elite http://t.co/Bp6sLTSP8D
Pretty dreadful debut by Liz Truss at Defra Qs. Apparently the #badger cull is all the fault of the last Labour government.
@MarieTidball great to meet you tonight - keep in touch!
Ed M presents Outstanding Achievement & Lifetime Achievement awards to @mcashmanCBE & his great love Paul Cottingham, who died on Friday.
@witchlet I support elected House of Lords but till then, he'll be a huge asset. And maybe check out his recent tweets before being nasty.
Nicky Morgan tells us that same-sex marriage vote was the most difficult decision of this parliament. Wasn't difficult for some of us!
At @pinknews awards in the Speaker's House. Lovely to see @mcashmanCBE, Lord Cashman as of yesterday.
@BristolRed the very rare furry greyhound... you don't see many of them these days
@FranStewart111 no, "a Prayer" is a Parliamentary device, was  asking the Queen to do something, not God.
Apparently PM is here to pray for Her Majesty to appoint the new Chair of the NAO. So, nothing to get excited about.
Now @AndySawfordMP Bill being opposed by a Tory backbencher, MP for Cleethorpes, off on a rant against publicly-run services.
Can only assume PM has returned to apologise for/ correct something he said at PMQs.
But why is David Cameron here?
In chamber for @AndySawfordMP excellent bill on allowing public sector operators to run rail franchises.
@BristolRed but if it takes an MP's intervention, at this late stage, something was wrong with the set-up
@BristolRed also a farm project in Eastville staffed by people with learning disabilities...
@BristolRed I've been talking to St George in Bloom - didn't know about awards but have now put one in, great ideas for urban pollination
@GreenRobTelford @bristolred doing that Rob, but structure shouldn't make it so hard for them to get a look in, lots of groups feel excluded
@BristolRed challenge for green capital is how we stop it being metro-centric, and take it out to communities.
@BristolRed he's one of those posh greens (one of many in Bristol) but I don't doubt his  credentials. Garrard Hassan is world-renowned.
@wurlyburgh on a national level, Helen Goodman is our shadow culture minister and did her own consultation on libraries earlier this year
@wurlyburgh as with post offices, need to adapt to changing times to survive, but still much needed.
@wurlyburgh I think good libraries not just about books - role as community hub, access to computers, services, info, should be increased
@wurlyburgh and directly affects my constituents but citywide headline figure is George/ council matter. It's not that I don't care!
@wurlyburgh difficult to express  this via twitter but I would certainly take interest if, say, St George library affected as in my patch
@wurlyburgh unfortunately councillors can't overturn his budget, he has absolute power - but can negotiate, and have scrutiny powers
@wurlyburgh MP's' ob is to hold Govt to account, eg for massive cuts to local govt funding.
@wurlyburgh it would be easy for me to criticise it - libraries are very important - but it's councillors who have budget scrutiny role
@wurlyburgh but it was George's decision - he sets the budget - and, from your timeline I see you haven't asked him, or any councillors...
@wurlyburgh wouldn't you be better off asking George?
@f_rountree @foreignoffice @youngfabians yes, that was their shorthand - eg I mentioned the PM's meeting with Dalai Lama & backlash
@f_rountree @foreignoffice @youngfabians that this Govt has tended towards a mercantilist approach to foreign policy
@f_rountree @foreignoffice @youngfabians tweets, of necessity, tend to rather simplify an argument but in general I think most would agree
Starting to get emails thanking me for voting for #RealRecall. Amendment wasn't perfect but set important marker.
@alicephillips90 Cool, if there anything you could send me by email so it gets into the diary folder?
@alicephillips90 What time does it go on till? I've organised a meeting on street sex workers in Eastville for 6, should be over by 7.30pm.
@LeePKelly Oh right. Well that explains everything.
@LeePKelly sorry, I don't understand that
Presumably they exercise the same statistical rigour when it comes to calculating public support for fox-hunting.
Clicked "why am I getting this" on their promo emails for Xmas gifts. It's because I'm "a valued supporter of the Countryside Alliance".

@EricPickled @ChriswMP last year they had a World Vegan Day display next to a sign saying..."Bacon: there's no better way to start the day"
@EricPickled @ChriswMP It has to be said, the other MPs frequenting the tearoom would probably agree with you!
Good day's work by Lords On Criminal Justice & Courts Bill. Government loses three votes - the 95th, 96th & 97th in this parliament.
@DominicTravers I have international human rights brief, as shadow FCO, not domestic, MOJ. In what way is this decision mine?
@iBristolPeople  I've also been told council now looking at business case and trying to find a business partner. Will ask for update.
@iBristolPeople my understanding is it's in draft capital programme and money ring fenced for it. Unless things have changed since August?

@RpzCwood @GeorgeFergusonx @swilliamsmp I've been saying this for a long time. Check out recent Lord Adonis report for Labour too.
@SharrifinChina I can't deal with casework enquiries via twitter. Assume you got auto-reply explaining how we prioritise? You'll hear soon.
@CAROLE_A_JONES @auntysoapbox I don't know who Jenny Falconer is either! Will reply as soon as I can.
@catherinharwood yes, will try to get a response to you next week.
@oneHumanist @mrssparklenose @dianajohnsonmp @carolinelucas neither of these bills will become law, as Govt will block.
@oneHumanist @mrssparklenose @dianajohnsonmp @carolinelucas as I've said, Diana has confirmed she intends to mean all schools.
@oneHumanist @mrssparklenose @dianajohnsonmp @carolinelucas as I've said, Caroline's bill won't get debated today. Diana's speech is online.
@oneHumanist @mrssparklenose @dianajohnsonmp @carolinelucas at the stage these bills are at, they don't have to be fully drafted.
@MrsSparklenose @oneHumanist @DianaJohnsonMP I asked her and that's what she told me, so I think she'd know!
Very sad news about the death of Paul Cottingham. Hard to believe he's gone. Thoughts are with @mcashmanCBE.
@PaoloFernley it's not two weeks early for Diwali...
@JamesGibson_ thanks for coming Janes, let's try to sort something out soon
At the monthly Bristol East CLP meeting, discussing youth provision in Bristol and other issues with our youth mayor.
@ChallengeGovUK @just_standing2 @paulinembarten it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say more, MPs owe constituents duty of confidentiality.
@ChallengeGovUK @just_standing2 @paulinembarten I've spoken to her MP, Chris Leslie. He has been very involved with this, is there to help.
Just been to see #stopthetraffik box on College Green, and coffee in the cathedral with Unseen, the Bishop and Bristol Soroptimists.
Had coffee/ interview with a royal marine commando in Cafe Gusto. Now off to lunch with President of Singapore who's visiting Bristol today.
@ConnollyStuart @stephenpope @FirstBSA and some people have to so things like get the kids to school first
@ConnollyStuart @stephenpope @FirstBSA they are already doing that
@garypepworth put on more services and lower fares to get people out of cars? But it's also about councils - park & rides, etc.
@katejerrold thanks.., just looking at email now
Last few RTs just a sample of what my timeline looks like this morning. Bristol buses getting worse not better?

Now seeing rave reviews on Twitter for C4 part of the Who are You? #GraysonPerry project. Missed that as was on way back to Bristol.
@MaxVeglio I will test you on plot flaws on Friday...
@bevclack I think it's an exhibition. The works are dotted around amongst the regular exhibits. The films are on 4, Weds at 10 I think.
Shown a brief clip of very funny Chris Huhne film. And the Huhne vase is a masterpiece. Should be on permanent display in members lobby.
Went to fab Grayson Perry evening at National Portrait Gallery tonight, combination of his Who are You? artwork and clips of films for C4.
@chris_paul71 Committee stage  is on Monday, so will do before then... Also got 200 emails on it ...just haven't had time to reply yet
@chris_paul71 So needs strengthening. Lots of amendments have been tabled, including by Zac, but I haven't had a chance to look at them yet
@chris_paul71 It's a Government Bill that's in the Commons now, not the backbench bill Zac introduced a while ago. Govt Bill is very weak..
@Bristolred Ta da! http://t.co/0tIYrUYBUc

@foodcyclebriz sorry I can't be there tonight - we're voting at 7pm - good to hear it's sold out, and hope you have a great evening!
@ChallengeGovUK sorry, I follow nearly 5000 people, don't get to see all their tweets!
@ChallengeGovUK yes, you should look at yesterday's Home Affairs Committee if you haven't already
@rover4832 Glad you enjoyed it! And I like your turtles and tiger tweets too. If I had a top three, it would be tigers, goats and turtles.
@ChallengeGovUK @IfBChristine @CLeslieMP @IanMcFadyen1966 As Caroline says in that report, issue is whether she has confidence of victims
@MrsSparklenose @oneHumanist @DianaJohnsonMP all schools, not just state-funded

Very much in favour of @DianaJohnsonMP's bill on compulsory SRE in schools - see here for details http://t.co/eNw6OlOgYV
@oneHumanist Labour's @DianaJohnsonMP introduced similar Bill today - her speech is here http://t.co/eNw6OlOgYV
@oneHumanist it's 6th on the list, it won't be reached - so won't be an opportunity to debate or vote for it.
@SharrifinChina I've had quite a few such cases. Can you drop me an email?
@crookedfootball but for the purposes of being able to exploit them when they arrive, that's different
@crookedfootball doesn't it depend on what the intention was? if to help them seek asylum, even if fee taken, not trafficked. If rescued...
@AJohnColes on CSA, home affairs select cttee has a hearing this morning, might force some answers
@crookedfootball it's a unicef stat, are you questioning it?

@KevinGa52088531 yep, http://t.co/SRbNNSqFq6
@thomaswilliams @alonorbach that would be correct. But I don't get asked onto Newsnight.
@catherinharwood Can you drop me a quick email? (Address is on twitter bio). Might be able to suggest a few things.
@LDNCalling everyone knows that!
@NCAVELL I would say so...
@KevinGa52088531 tortured souls, and twisted bodies, that sort of thing. Some of his figures even look like Ian Curtis dancing.
Though I do already have ticket for the Egon Schiele exhibition about to open at the Courtauld. He is to art what Joy Division is to music.
Really glad I finally got to see brilliant Malevich exhibition before it closes on Sunday. Don't do that often enough...
@Paulnuk @duncangeere I think there are also concerns about animal testing. Seen that somewhere.
@TheSeveredLimb Just have... The @jakeyapp response is pretty good too.

@chris_paul71 not so much plot holes maybe, as things the cops would have picked up on - I suppose get out clause was, cops not interested
@williamoulton that's up to planning committee to decide, but its very close to several schools, including Bristol Met.
@williamoulton @mikelloydjones this isn't PRSC against Tesco Mark 2.
@williamoulton @mikelloydjones but there has also been a court case on the proximity to schools point, which I cite.
@williamoulton @mikelloydjones if you look at the objection I've already tabled, it sets them out there: traffic, litter, pollution...
@FestivalofIdeas @karinsmyth yes, happy to do so.
@Paulnuk @duncangeere used a lot in veggie burgers, it's a binding agent. Quorn has now committed to doing some products without it I think.

@bowers_mase PS It's 9pm on a Saturday night, and I've been working since 10am, so I intend to sign off now...
@bowers_mase ..to understand point of my 4 previous tweets demonstrates and b) I have 90,000 constituents, can't do other MPs' work too!
@bowers_mase a) nothing to do with whether answer is public or not, it's not something that can be done in 140 characters as your failure...
@bowers_mase I thought I answered it pretty comprehensively; if you're my constituent you can email me and I'll reply in more detail
@bowers_mase can and should detain if good grounds for suspicion, but still have right to a fair trial
@bowers_mase but not if always British citizen, can't render stateless - and I both cases would need to convict first
@bowers_mase if they've acquired British citizenship, ie previously citizen of another country, can strip them
@bowers_mase are you asking about whether they should be stripped of citizenship? or just arrested/ charged/ etc?
@fandang @bbc6music How come you got quoted suggesting One Nation Under a Groove and I didn't? Sulking now!
@Mabbes1408 @bbc6music Very good.
@BBC6Music One Nation under a Groove is pretty long... Maybe not quite ten minutes though.
@zoesqwilliams well he does tend to warn of impending disaster in every article he writes, but that doesn't mean he won't one day be right!
“@bristol_citizen: THEY ARE SHAFTING AVONMOUTH ON TUESDAY http://t.co/4qCYE3ONZA” < surely this should got to committee?
@zoesqwilliams haven't really kept up with issue in recent years, as I'm in shadow FCO team now, but think root problems still there
@zoesqwilliams but you are right. I was going to pick up on it too but I'd have just said 'the green deal was crap' - now I can explain why!
“@zoesqwilliams: Sorry, incredibly long subtweet delivered in the wrong order. Bored on a train” < and I've managed to RT in wrong order too

@AM_HC @HadleighRoberts might know someone
@ayestotheright He has far more important things to do! We did try and wave but you weren't paying attention.
@AM_HC Emma Reynolds might have done. You could try the international unit at the Party, they deal with sister party relations.

@AlastairAsher @rcgp well that wouldn't happen... not sure what your point is?
Now in chamber for debate on National Pollinator Strategy.mMore important than it sounds. Will be talking about urban pollination & Bristol.
@Seasaver Thanks for swift response. You're right.
@Seasaver As ever, I am quite conflicted after reading that report. I'd rather we found non-leather alternatives. What's your view?
@dianebartlett99 Salt 'n shake! I can remember Golden Wonder crisps going up from 4p to 4.5p.
But Government has failed to respond to the very good points made by the APPG in its cross-party report, so does warrant criticism.
Tory MP complaining that some MPs are criticising the Government in this #cycling debate. Says it breaks down cross-party working of APPG.
@wood5y c30 MPs here... that's more than there will be when we move from bikes to bees later on! (I'm speaking, of course).
No mention in Govt #cycling plan as to role DCLG could play. Eric Pickles says it's "a middle class obsession no-one else cares about".
@AM_HC no, don't really have much contact with European parties. My brief is further afield.
.@TheIanCruise if you read my previous tweets, that was exactly my point. I described Govt plan as 'hugely disappointing"!
Govt's #cycling delivery plan states an ambition of doubling journeys by 2025 (so 4%) most of which would be met by growth in London.
The APPG report calls for target of 10% trips by bike by 2025 (German level) and 25% (close to Dutch level) by 2050. Current UK level is 2%.
In #cycling debate. Govt plan published today, hugely disappointing, falls well short of what Get Britain Cycling report called for.
@Finn_Mackay I suppose it's to indicate how local/ directly affected people are, but I take your point, especially re strip clubs @mthrel
Just about to ask about it at DCMS Qs...
Just received notice that @fleecebristol back before planning committee on October 22nd. Developers trying to overturn planning conditions.
@twistol he could be banned from owning a dog for behaving like that to a pet, why is he still allowed to keep sheep?
Good chat also today with @markdavyd from @VenueTrust talking about @FleeceBristol. Will be raising this at DCMS Qs tomorrow.
I will be speaking about #hungerforjustice - a climate justice campaign - at All Saints Church, Fishponds, on Sunday.
Also met today with climate change campaigners from Bolivia & the Philippines with @christian_aid to discuss #hungerforjustice campaign.
@triAmie07 I didn't realise there was another vegan in the room! All that talk about pigs....
@turnerwebster I am truly the least "crafty" person ever, but have given it a RT and will tell my mum!
@suethorney thank you!
At the launch of Protect the Waves APPG with @SAScampaigns and @MoveTheWorldUK. Check out dates on this... http://t.co/6NQ0n0sdJj
@ejfoundation yes, I'm hoping to speak in the debate - got quite a lot of material already but will definitely look at this too.
@MikeWheeler13 I will if you provide them!
@andrewjdunne @UniofBathIPR thank you, that's very helpful.
Douglas Carswell has parked himself in the middle of Labour's working-class heroes front row, with Dennis Skinner and comrades.
@rcgp Thanks. We did a survey across 3 seats & I met with local management committee. Very real concerns about a crisis in primary care.
The Royal College of GPs says there's a shortfall of 3-4000 GPs, putting doctors under huge pressure. What's Cameron's  answer? #pmqs
@sawatkiss yet govt refuses to accept in-work poverty exists
Prof Paul Gregg, formerly of Bristol Uni, now at Bath - average worker £5000 a year worse off since financial crisis http://t.co/SGL73CMYeA
A must read from yesterday's Guardian Education, on how schools are providing a welfare safety net for pupils  http://t.co/eQNPHnU5xz
Off to @FoodCycle breakfast/ report launch this morning, where I'll be saying a few words about why I'm a patron and how great they are!
@Sunflowerball14 @CFAware That's a lovely idea. Would be happy to promote it in Bristol.
@MrsBurgin @tulipsiddiq @kerrypollard_ he is indeed wonderful but he has a terrible twitter name. After next May he can be @therealKerryMP.
@StuartWheeler28 @benpbradshaw @alisonseabeck @carolinekolek That would be McCarthy actually, but apart from that, you're forgiven!
@TulipSiddiq @kerrypollard_ apparently Hyacinth was originally the name of a young man in Greek mythology (yes, I've been googling).
@xkylet sorry to hear that, hope no-one was hurt? just cc'ing your councillors @fbreckels and @BristolEaSteve
@briscityhall @tdebbonaire they've done it on other backbench debates they knew they'd lose too, like on badger cull.
@BrisCityHall @tdebbonaire actually there's no rule to say ministers can't vote; it's a Govt whips tactic to render vote less legitimate.
@StuartWheeler28 @benpbradshaw @alisonseabeck @CarolineKolek Ahem... Aren't you forgetting someone?
@BevaniteEllie @labourplaques  Think 'Tony Benn in the broom cupboard' and just do it yourself.
@TulipSiddiq @kerrypollard_ perhaps that's why he says 'man' three times in the first line of his twitter bio? I usually get the opposite!
@BevaniteEllie @labourplaques that was quick! Where was his London home?
@leilazadeh Thank you! Came as a bit of a surprise but I'm honoured they thought of me.
@labourplaques @labourhistory I took a photo of @bevaniteellie with it, which is somewhere. She's the one to write about Bevan!
Just popped into a Dyspraxia Awareness event in parliament, hosted by @EmmaLewellBuck who is doing great work highlighting the condition.
@TonyDDyer DUP and a few Tories, it will be in Hansard. Was a one line whip so people didn't have to be there. Looks like Govt abstained.
@SacredJP @sharonhodgsonmp Some didn't vote, but often when it's a one line whip they're out on campaign visits.
@julianswainson ah, that would probably be why he called the debate
@K_CJohnson @Lab2Palestine None
@Janebfc @Markfergusonuk had tweeted the 12 names
@julianswainson I'll ignore that
Have discovered an "alternate version" of Life During Wartime with amazing guitar noise. Perfect night bus music,
@iBristolPeople @MetroBusTW well that's a council decision, but I have asked quite a few PQs about valuing BMV land within planning system.
House of Commons IS now debating "Ferries to the Isle of Wight". Chamber has mysteriously emptied...
@earlythorn @geovanni218 I didn't see him!
@Janebfc It will be in Hansard tomorrow. DUP... and a handful of others, but don't know who.
Proud to be one of the 274 MPs to vote to #RecognisePalestine tonight. Only 12 voted against.
Some excellent speeches in #fRecognisePalestine debate. I can't speak as only one shadow FCO minister can, but plenty more waiting to do so.
@DoctorDanLyons no, far too busy for that!
Hague has just confirmed no Govt legislation at all this week. Perhaps we should be grateful.
In Cttee Room 6 waiting for St Brendan's students to arrive. Bit of an odd 'back to school' vibe today. Dark and gloomy indoors and out.
@SteveSmith98 @andyburnhammp eg will keep the CCGs, and try to make them work, that's what GPs & others have told me they want
@SteveSmith98 @andyburnhammp suggest you look at some of Andy's speeches; he's made quite clear won't be reorganisation for the sake of it
Last RT means Palestine debate will start quite late, as the statements don't start till 3.30pm. Will run till 10pm.
@dafyddtaylor @thecomputers that would only occur to the perverted amongst us, (ergo....)
On the train listening to music and reading Spectator piece about Brooks Newmark and "Sex Texts" by @thecomputers comes on...
@Markfergusonuk It wouldn't have been difficult to find out the facts - we got emailed 'the whip' last week, as usual, showing a one liner
@Markfergusonuk that's been my understanding all along - backbench motions always are
@gram63 @ro_bot_dylan there are so many great lines in it; my favourite is the way he sings "slowly into autumn..."
@Neilwigg @ro_bot_dylan not sure... you can try a request?
I love it when @ro_bot_dylan tweets Idiot Wind, as he's doing tonight.
@chris_paul71 @OwenJones84 what would you like to see us do?
@jossgarman right to sack him but wrong to give him the job in the first place!
@MrGreenGus @marghickman wrong again... Labour support for two state solution based on 67 borders was policy then and now.
@MrGreenGus @marghickman We do. we're voting for it tomorrow. NNTR, just putting record straight, again.
@MissMariaWolf thanks for coming along - it's great to see the community coming together to fight this
@AbdiOBoobe @somaliforum @swilliamsmp @clesliemp happy to do it but please include candidates too, @tdebbonaire @darrenpjones @karinsmyth
@allyska No, it's lower down Fishponds Road... The old tile centre opposite KwikFit which has been empty for a long time.
@philmansell1992 @westerneye Yes, that's fine. And you don't have to worry about the credit either!
@ChiOnwurah Let's talk on Monday!
Some great work being done by @ChiOnwurah on McDonalds near schools issue http://t.co/aUCW5yu0ZH
McDonalds will be 24 hour drive thru. How can we stop litter being thrown out of car windows by people who don't respect their community?
So pleased by turnout & diversity at today's meeting. @mthrel & @cllrmkhan have done a great job mobilising people. http://t.co/KNgoDNSPBF
Standing room only at #stopmcdonalds meeting. 120 objections already tabled and petition here http://t.co/58Eo4Y5AYl
There's another campaign meeting today against McDonalds Fishponds... 2pm at All Saints in Grove Rd. Deadline for objections is 15th.
@FiDaisyG @MarkTLogan @FishpondsGFNP I've not heard of forest schools till now, will have to find out more.
@adartington @JoelTaylorMetro @nopigtoobig @ChriswMP I've been told blueberries thrive in these areas & would generate more profit.
@VegfestExpress let me try and sort when in office - I'm out on a wounded badger patrol in Somerset with LACS & Bill Oddje right now.
Me telling @darrenpjones who's boss! http://t.co/xFP60eBLj2
@bamojobocyn Link doesn't work?
@ChallengeGovUK yes will be voting for it
@MikeWheeler13 @christianwolmar I'm afraid I'm already booked up...
@SouthvilleRob @joesalterbris @bgreencapital @BristolCouncil @Bristol_2015 @MrGreenGus I tried asking him at the weekend & he had a tantrum.
@ChallengeGovUK @Standup4Labour @BristolSouthLab @bristoleastlab @Bristol_Culture We've sold over 100, you don't need to worry,
@joesalterbris @bgreencapital I asked them days ago if more could be done to publicise grants, but no reply.
@JoelTaylorMetro @nopigtoobig @chriswmp but it's late and I have to give a lecture to students tomorrow, so will have to bow out now!
@JoelTaylorMetro @nopigtoobig @chriswmp you could make same argument about tobacco industry.. and not all land has to be farmed, does it?
@alstewitn @emilythornberry 15 followers...
@JoelTaylorMetro @ChriswMP why not?
@TheShamBall @darrenpjones @BristolRed ironing the night before is definitely a no-no though.
@TheShamBall @darrenpjones @BristolRed obviously if you have to ask that question the correct answer is no, and you should get the iron out.
@TheShamBall @darrenpjones @BristolRed I do like things to match! But I tend towards the "can I get away without ironing this?" camp.
@HeinzJunkins @dsic @BenArcherAuthor @exchangebristol same day as the gig?
@JoelTaylorMetro @nopigtoobig in what way is it practically unrealistic? I've managed it for 23 years, @ChriswMP for much longer.
@BristolOxjam let me look at that tomorrow - I'm doing festival of ideas in the afternoon but probably free afterwards.
@sarcasminasuit @EmilyThornberry you should have said hello! @bristolred has just told me who you are IRL.
@saharaguts @bristol_citizen @BristolRed they didn't make it onto the Switch Club Luton playlist http://t.co/RdVkTNxvRF
@darrenpjones @BristolRed I've told you Darren, real men don't iron. You're getting lots of strange texts. I might start live tweeting them.
@saharaguts @bristol_citizen @BristolRed Into the Abyss!
@darrenpjones @BristolRed what's it worth?
@bristol_citizen @BristolRed almost, I'm leading them in a rousing version of Conquistador by Theatre of Hate.
@darrenpjones I have your phone. We are in the pub trying to crack the pass code.
Now listening to @EmilyThornberry talking about this 'legally illiterate' Government and its attack on human rights.
Just about to RT link to petition against McDonalds restaurant and drive-thru on Fishponds Rd - pls sign & spread the word if you're local.
Now hearing from @AmberRuddMP the DECC Minister, on Green Deal for Communities. All about grass-roots, delivering street by street.
Now at Warm Up Bristol - http://t.co/cNsNeP6bVt - council run insulation/ energy conservation programme for 30,000+ homes over 4 years.
Cutting through St George's Park on way to Warm Homes Bristol launch. Lovely and autumnal. Magpies and squirrels.
I'm at May Park School watching a @LifeCycleUKteam bikeability training session for years 5 and 6.
Am now at SW TULO Unions Together meeting with lots of Labour PPCs and union members, gearing up for May 2015.
So @ReeceFranciss & I went to @FiRealUK for Ital stew, and suddenly around 30 Old Market traders & @MargHickman turned up for a meeting.
@IanBoulton congrats Ian, would love to see you in parliament next year
@Veganism that's an excellent piece
@Quakermum I'm going to read that next.
@davesimps0n The talk? It was good, but I couldn't think of anything to say to him when I got my books signed!
@Broadbeak @paulwaugh Paul has now given up on it, on the grounds Johnny Cash would never have worn chinos. He's quite right.
@paulwaugh or there's his version of Nick Cave's Mercy Seat "and anyway I told the truth... but I'm afraid I told a lie"
“@mthrel: @KerryMP petition on air & noise pollution from M32 now live!
 http://t.co/EVE1bYDTPb” < pls sign if you live/ work/ play nearby
@paulwaugh I'm tempted to say "Ring of (Pants On) Fire" #cleggCashsongs
@Clarkybudd I can't actually table EDMs as I'm a frontbencher but can write to ministers (etc). Have told him that.
@Clarkybudd sorry, but have been in touch with organiser since about next steps
@Clarkybudd I did email organiser as soon as I knew - didn't have a phone number -and asked Marc to pass on my apologies too.
@Clarkybudd found out at 11am Sat that the 11am meeting had been put back to 12 without me being told. And already had another event at 1pm.
Darkness has fallen in Middleton so heading back to Bristol. Great to meet @LMcInnes_Labour - best of luck on Thursday!
@guid0man @BigJeffJohns @msc45 @wshed thanks, and yes, still searching for that missing Iceage ticket!
@msc45 @guid0man @bigjeffjohns @wshed I obviously need to get on some mailing list so I don't miss these things!
@wshed @guid0man @bigjeffjohns oh bother, my fault for not checking it out sooner! Thanks for reply though.
@guid0man @bigjeffjohns Is @wshed showing Pride? So many people have been raving about it.
@davesimps0n you didn't tell me you were doing an in conversation with Bernard Sumner! I went to Manchester one but wdv gone to yours too.
Yesterday I finished reading Dark Places, earlier book by author of Gone Girl. Thought it was way better.
@smithmarke Er no... Now that's an idea!
Anyway... Off to Heywood & Middleton to support @LMcInnes_Labour. Hope it's as sunny there as it is in Bristol!
@BenArcherAuthor @exchangebristol and I'm not angling for one now! They're doing a couple of dates in London, I can catch them there.
It doesn't say on any ticket sites that it's sold out... But when you try to order it says unavailable, so I guess it has...
All these people getting Glastonbury tickets while I'm just trying - and failing - to get a ticket for Sleaford Mods at @exchangebristol!
@IanBoulton no, thanks Ian for letting me know
@HelloMarcoPolo that could be the culprit in last week's office scandal...
@arsenesmagichat @seanbeynon @mrgreengus That really is childish. Just leave me out of this conversation.
@arsenesmagichat @seanbeynon @MrGreenGus I'm an MP and a shadow foreign office minister, not a local councillor. It's rather different.
I see @CUBECINEMA is showing Viv Goldman's Punky Reggae Party next Sunday. But it's my sister's birthday so I won't be able to make it.
@SteveSmith98 @mthrel @CllrMKhan traffic - very busy road, loads of takeaways/ food outlets already, litter, and right near school
@veganbristol well that would be excellent
@paulspencer42 @mthrel @CllrMKhan it was too dark to take a pic of the room! Mhairi and Khan were helpfully stood in front of the window.
Now doing street surgery in St George with@BristolEaSteve and @fbreckels. Nice and sunny!
Went for quick drink in @GreenbankEaston with @mthrel and @CllrMKhan - will have to pop back for a #vegan cheese pizza soon...
Great turnout for meeting organised by @mthrel & @CllrMKhan against plans for drive-thru McDonalds in Fishponds Rd. http://t.co/NkCFqAInCO
@allyska it's a black history month event
@allyska at BME youth forum at City Academy
Young people here talking about difference between knowing you're black and when you first realise how that means you're perceived
@IanMcFadyen1966 @shinybluedress my predecessor, Baroness Corston, has done a lot of work on vulnerable women wrongly held in prison system
@IanMcFadyen1966 @shinybluedress @CLeslieMP as I think it's important to know what reps have already been made and replies received
@IanMcFadyen1966 @shinybluedress @CLeslieMP Sorry, don't think I included you in my reply. Will speak to Chris Leslie as a first move.
@shinybluedress @CLeslieMP in first instance I will talk to Chris Leslie, who I think is her MP.
@MrGreenGus @chillibronze that's what you could have said in response to my very first question...!
@tchee @standup4labour @alfiemoore @wpcancercharity that great, but daunting. I wouldn't ever dare!
@hammy72 @allpartycycling I'm sorry, I don't think I'm going to be able to make it, first two weeks back are massively busy.
@MrGreenGus I've just checked, Andrew Garrard is chair of the Green Capital 2015 board.
@MrGreenGus well I meant Andrew Garrard, who is the one who wrote to me about the director being axed
@LabourHistory @labourplaques we have one on Southmead estate in Bristol, Nye Bevan, the 10,000th council house built after war
@MrGreenGus @philip_antony So I think I'll look to him for answers. He strikes me as very engaged, very keen to make it work.
@MrGreenGus @philip_antony and I've met the director three times this year. Hoping to meet the chair soon - we've spoken informally already.
@MrGreenGus @philip_antony now you're just being silly. I asked the mayor for figures on job creation November last year. (He made them up.)
@philip_antony @MrGreenGus and there was me thinking twitter was about public engagement...
@tchee @Standup4Labour @alfiemoore Margaret's not doing stand up is she?!
@MrGreenGus @dazzter eg Elm Tree Farm, run by Brandon Trust, people with learning disabilities - they didn't know when we spoke yesterday
@MrGreenGus @dazzter I know about grants, community groups in Bristol East by by and large don't -  and tiny compared to overall budget
@MrGreenGus Well protecting the blue finger certainly isn't. Nor is being a flagship food waste city. Will email about a meeting.
@GreenRobTelford @BristleKRS  he's got the green cabinet portfolio  - I assumed that meant he was something to do with it. He ought to be.
@GreenRobTelford @BristleKRS and you're saying Gus isn't involved but he's blaming Labour Cllrs for not getting involved? I'm confused.
@GreenRobTelford @BristleKRS I didn't say he did. Is this really about a company that has nothing to do with BCC, no accountability?
@Burthammer @MrGreenGus officers didn't even consult mayor or other politicians - yet can I get anyone held to account?
@Burthammer @MrGreenGus and more - on the latter, Bristol had the chance to be one of the flagship food waste authorities - turned it down
@Burthammer @MrGreenGus home insulation; allotments, local food, and urban pollination; protecting blue finger soil; tackling food waste
@FiDaisyG @bgreencapital @RethinkMetrobus well of course there's that too! Trying to get meetings with the Mayor and Transport Minister.
@dazzter @MrGreenGus but the focus seems to be on "selling" Bristol as green, ie a PR/ marketing thing - I want to see Bristol transformed
@dazzter @MrGreenGus it should but i'm worried that there's little focus on legacy and making Bristol a greener place 1/2
@bgreencapital I'm concerned that groups I speak to in my patch haven't heard about the grants - can more be done to publicise?
@TheStrategos10 @MrGreenGus Which is what I've had all along. As I've told George I want GC to be a success; that's why I'm seeking answers.
@BristleKRS @GreenRobTelford  indeed - but I was asking publicly because a lot of people want to know, and because it's easy to ask
@MrGreenGus whenever I've tried to engage with you on green issues you've responded like this. It's really petty and doesn't serve Bristol.
@MrGreenGus I've been trying to be engaged from the start - but the most I get back is spin and sidestepping of my Qs.
@MrGreenGus sorry, I assumed you would still be taking an interest, it being a Bristol thing and a green thing
@bristol_citizen @OmegaJak @AidanSemple @clogmuso I'm on a quest to find out the truth. It's important we know.
@BristleKRS @OmegaJak @AidanSemple @clogmuso @bristol_citizen "their song" is Perfect Circle by REM, I believe
@AidanSemple @OmegaJak @clogmuso @bristol_citizen Huey Lewis and the News
@OmegaJak @AidanSemple @clogmuso @bristol_citizen  he claims to like them... I read a biog saying he actually liked Phil Collins at Uni
@deadlydarcy @GeorgeFergusonx @RethinkMetrobus there's someone wandering around wearing his trousers too if that's the case
@kitterfeed yes, but I got there 11-ish as that was only time I could make, so chatted to them while they were setting up
@ElectriCheese @marcthevet I'm hoping there will be lots. Will blame Marc if there isn't.
@MrGreenGus can you reassure me - and others - it's all OK? People outside inner circle feel totally excluded, want to know what's going on.
@MrGreenGus may have missed it but haven't seen anything from you re Green Capital director leaving...?
@GeorgeFergusonx but judging from your tweets you're very much here? Can we meet next week? It's time critical. @RethinkMetrobus
@GeorgeFergusonx my office has been trying to make an urgent appointment with you to discuss Metrobus, was told you're away till 10th...
@dangusset I said no, but he kept asking so I told him to ask the old man who'd just turned up to buy coffee too
@jonathancmunro @id1om that is so right.
@peterceastwood I'd be happy to do so... Looks interesting! Can you email - it's on twitter biog - so we can sort something?
@stephenmaudsley if you don't know by now, it's probably best you don't find out
@ElectriCheese Pervert, more like. Thankfully we were interrupted by an old man wanting coffee, so I told him to ask him instead.
Re last RT - the elephant/ rhino march in Bristol leaves Castle Park at noon. I'll be there, as will @marcthevet.
“@careforthewild: @KerryMP Hi kerry, it's the global March 4 eles & rhinos tomorrow,  Bristol, London, Birmingham. Pls spread the word!”
@xMATTxLAWx Cocoa!
I also bought a coffee from a man who steered the conversation onto books then asked if I could 'relate to' anything in 50 shades of grey...
... as well as spoken at a mosque, done a surgery, spent an hour talking politics on BCFM, and a few hours of emails...
Home at last.. Today I've been to gym, climbed on top of a fire engine with FBU, visited Brandon Trust stall in Cabot Circus & bought plants
@trevoreid @BrandonTrust @CabotCircus Great to see you too... I've been so busy today haven't had time to tweet but will post on facebook.
@bristol_citizen @AidanSemple yes, me too.
@bigusrobus @bristol_citizen @AidanSemple https://t.co/IFuqgELsfZ
@bigusrobus @bristol_citizen @AidanSemple No.
@bigusrobus @bristol_citizen @AidanSemple "scene kids are fun, emo kids are sad" http://t.co/6ek5xykywe
@bigusrobus @bristol_citizen @AidanSemple My niece is "scene" not EMO - apparently they wear black AND very bright colours.
@bristol_citizen @AidanSemple But I was never into the Mission, or even the Sisters really. I like the Sisters more now than I did then.
@bristol_citizen @AidanSemple So did I... after Ziggy Stardust, whenever that was. Also saw Theatre of Hate a lot.
@bristol_citizen @AidanSemple Although I suppose I did my fair share of Bauhaus... All the boys I knew wanted to be Pete Murphy.
@bristol_citizen @AidanSemple I was never a Goth, though most of my friends dabbled. I was more into post-punk indie, like Joy Division.
@AidanSemple @bristol_citizen @trinitybristol I have Jesus & Mary Chain, Jim Noir, Bonnie Prince Billy, Vaselines and Iceage lined up next.
@AidanSemple @bristol_citizen @trinitybristol are they playing?
@bristol_citizen @bristol247 someone on her salary shouldn't really have "spare time" should she? Or is she doing it on Sundays?

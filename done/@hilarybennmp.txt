@TrevorBeattie @sdnpa thanks a lot Trevor. It was a day I will always remember and it would not have happened without a huge team effort.

Motion in favour of the recognition of the state of Palestine has just been carried by the House of Commons by 274 votes to 12.

@RedRob68 We should respond to the Iraqi Government's request for help to stand up to ISIL.
@NatashaBooji   It's about supporting the Iraqi Government and its people in the face of murderous barbarism.
By 2015 UK aid will help immunise more than 55m children against preventable diseases, but UKIP want to cut it by 85%. Shameful.
Ed Miliband’s proposed Constitutional Convention will help mend our broken politics and forge a new English settlement.
Why didn't David Cameron talk this morning about empowering England's counties?
The Scottish people have spoken and  solidarity, not division, has been the victor.  Thanks to everyone in the Better Together campaign.
@SovereignAnnie @andrewspoooner @jimmurphymp  No-one has betrayed anyone - the people have had their say.
My colleague @jimmurphymp has done a great job in taking the #nothanks case and his crates all over Scotland.
The size of the turnout in the #indyref is inspiring.
@daysofspeed  Yes, and Ed Miliband has already said we will do exactly this.
Another important lesson from this Referendum. It's time to let 16 and 17 years olds vote. #democracy
Talking about the referendum on the phone earlier no-one said "I am not voting" or "It makes no difference".  Shows in the huge turnout.
@CSalahi96   It would make it more difficult to get rid of the bedroom tax for the 2,000 or so of my constituents hit by it. So it matters.

@jlocke13 for many people affected, there aren't smaller properties for them to move to, so they're being taxed for something they can't do
@JWhittlesElbow  that's not how my constituents see it.
@scottdsellers  I agree, which is why we also want to see the minimum wage rise.

@Alasdair91 @Torcuil yes but it's a first step to abolition. And it was votes from all parts of the United Kingdom that did it. #solidarity
David Cameron has just been beaten in the House of Commons on the bedroom tax.  306 votes to 231. First step towards abolition.
Just voted for the first step on the road leading to the abolition of the hated bedroom tax.
A really powerful speech from @ChrisBryantMP demolishing the bedroom tax.
@Dancad Labour is committed to repeal the bedroom tax.
@DanthebeemanBee  Most people affected can't downsize because there are not enough smaller homes to move into. That's why it's a tax.
Commons debating bill to reduce the impact of the awful bedroom tax. It's unfair, it doesn't work and it undermines family life #bedroomtax
@SouthLeedsLife  sorry I wasn't there, but I was heading back to Westminster for an important vote on the bedroom tax tomorrow.

@meaglemp will open our debate on flooding in the House this afternoon.  Invest in flood defences and adapt to a changing climate.

How can the Government honour its pledge to flood victims on council tax with only 3 months worth of funding? http://t.co/OU1o0UCmin
IDS says he wants to end welfare dependency. So then, what word would he use to describe people being forced to ask strangers for food ?
@rblack_51 @politicshome @labourpress @BBCNews with respect, we increased the flood defence budget.
@_SmartUK  can you please email me on bennh@parliament.uk Thanks

@andysawfordmp brilliantly highlighting the fundamental unfairness of the Government's approach to local government funding.
Ian Lavery's 10 min rule bill that would scrap the hated bedroom tax gets the support of the House of Commons. When will David Cameron act?
As scientists have been telling us for some time, our climate is changing and we must prepare for both floods and drought in the years ahead
@Aassppiicc what's your view on the seatbelt law?
@Aassppiicc but then smokers are forcing children to breathe in smoke and they have no choice in the matter. It's about balancing rights.

Why did the councils so badly affected by flooding have to wait so long for DCLG ministers to announce Bellwin support at 100%.
Why did the council

@TheDecider25  2 million additional homes of which 500,000 were affordable.  A million and a half homes brought up to decency standard.
Paul Goggins was as compassionate, principled and cheerful a man as one could have the privilege to know. Our hearts go out to his family.

Energy bills will still rise for families this year while energy companies' profits will be unaffected. We need an energy price freeze.

Thanks everyone for contacting me about the Government's awful lobbying bill. As Angela Eagle said it's inadequate, sinister and partisan.
Labour local government should be proud of the progress it's making

@Peston  Well if it's any consolation Robert I remember the edition when the panel consisted of all four Beatles.
.@nick_clegg has some explaining to do. Lib Dem councils have the worst record on women in senior jobs. Even behind the Tories!
Thousands of places on adult ­education and training ­courses axed as part of government cuts, Labour reveal. http://t.co/D55Lv5sbGj

Parliament not persuaded by the Prime Minister on military action against Syria. World must now redouble its efforts to end the civil war.
Lenders warn that without big boost to housebuilding the Help to Buy scheme will merely push up house prices. Government is failing to act.
What George Osborne and Eric Pickles didn't tell councils about local government funding in 2015/16....http://t.co/Q7z0wD75yn
@LGANews @BBCNews @thetimes  this shows why we need action to deal with unnecessary land banking as Labour has called for.
Eric Pickles suddenly announced  the end of check off for trade union subscriptions in his Dept. Good employers provide it - why not DCLG?

Extraordinary Taliban letter to Malala Yousafzai trying to justify their attempt to murder this brave 15 yr old. Shocking and self-serving.

Poor NHS care must be dealt with, but Jeremy Hunt's attack on Andy Burnham in his statement was beneath him and is not the way to do it.

National Housing Federation: “the £3bn over three years announced today is in reality a further disappointing cut” http://t.co/6wK1l6kAhW
£3bn over 3yrs from 2015 for affordable homes = nothing new this yr or next & won't even make up for cut to budget made this parliament!
At meeting in Commons on Kashmir. As one speaker said "how can we make it a bridge to peace rather than a bone of contention."
@asgharlab
Important news from Nationwide allowing landlords with mortgages to offer tenants 3yr leases, as Labour called for http://t.co/8e5xWZOvno
Chancellor talks about fairness !!  So why such an unfair distribution of the cuts to local councils?
No explanation from Chancellor as to why  the ten most deprived councils are losing 6 times as much in spending power as ten least deprived
Very bad news about 250 job losses at Direct Line in Leeds announced this morning. I have spoken to the company.
Looks like local council services will be hit hard in tomorrow's CSR - the result of the Chancellor's failure to get the economy growing.
In the chamber for Home Sec's statement on the allegations that police attempted to smear Stephen Lawrence's family. Truly shocking.

See my statement on the Secretary of State's decision to order a new review of children's heart surgery
http://t.co/ZmiyPZEs9j
We would never have achieved this outcome without the great campaign in support of the Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Unit @SaveOurSurgery
Health Secretary recognises that children's heart surgery review was flawed - a vindication for the Leeds campaign.
@thomasforth It's a start but we need more lines. I support HS2 because it will be good for the economy of the city and the region.
@thomasforth  and we also discussed the NGT trolleybus scheme which will be a boost to public transport in the city. #Leeds
@thomasforth  I was actually answering a question about bus/train interchange and said that HS2 would provide a chance to look at this.

Huge crowds in Millennium Square for the Leeds Food Festival. Delicious Yorkshire fare. Now where is the ice cream? http://t.co/0sqV7eKQf9
@HenryPryor  it's wrong that local communities could be cut out altogether from planning decisions that affect them. The Gov should rethink.
Government should drop its undemocratic plans to take planning decisions away from local council and communities
It's precisely because we need to build more homes that local communities have to take responsibility for granting planning permission.
2 million more homes built under last Labour Gov. Tory planning mess leads to      lowest peacetime housing completions since 1920s.
Why we have to make localism work in planning to build the new homes we need.  http://t.co/pEmxSEk16a
@AgeUKLeeds   Happy baking !

@Wilsation11.    I will be voting against the badger cull in Parliament this Wednesday.
Who attacked the International Committee of the Red Cross office in Afghanistan this week and why?  They do great work and don't take sides.
@IanCampbell_ @MariamariaRBM  Not so. It's about both.
Government planning changes that come in today take power away from local communities to shape high streets. What happened to localism ?
@RozieBreen @BBCLeeds @GroundworkLeeds  Just shows what you can do with determination and green fingers!
@Leedsrowing  Yes. Reply with you shortly. best wishes

My constituents are fined for taking their kids on  trips in school time. Why is this Michael Gove rule different for David Cameron? Thu Mar 26 08:51:55 GMT 2015
There is another possible answer for Osborne's gaffe. Cameron panicked into VAT retreat. Hence Matthew Hancock's car crash interview. Thu Mar 26 08:42:17 GMT 2015
Instead of managing chronic relapsing drug dependency, IDS has created a revolving door of treatment that blocks welfare benefit cuts. Thu Mar 26 08:39:11 GMT 2015
Tory drug and alcohol confusion has a fascinating downside on welfare benefits. They are locked into a moral maze that blocks welfare cuts. Thu Mar 26 08:37:16 GMT 2015
David Gauke, like Osborne, refuses to identify planned welfare cuts. That is because they are to pensioners: Rich, poor and in the  Middle. Thu Mar 26 08:30:34 GMT 2015
Vote today on whether MPs should revert back to secret voting. LibDems backing it. What would Joe Grimond make of his legacy? Thu Mar 26 08:28:35 GMT 2015
Treasury Committee unanimously demanded that party programmes be costed pre may 7th  by independent OBR. Blocked by George Osborne. Thu Mar 26 08:16:39 GMT 2015
George Osborne didn't mislead Treasury Committee over welfare cuts. He just refused to say where they were coming from ( answer pensioners). Thu Mar 26 07:57:58 GMT 2015
George Osborne also misled  Treasury Committee over net  rise in immigration on his watch. He said up 298,000. In fact up over 1 million Thu Mar 26 07:56:26 GMT 2015
George Osborne also misled Treasury Ctte on national debt rise under his watch. He said up £300 billion. Actual rise is £505 billion. Thu Mar 26 07:54:20 GMT 2015
Osborne is in contempt of Parliament following Hancock's confession on @BBCNewsnight Wed Mar 25 23:21:41 GMT 2015
What Hancock let slip is Osborne misled Treasury Committee purely to set up political ambush. Very major democracy issue. Wed Mar 25 23:19:41 GMT 2015
Osborne misleading Treasury Committee is the most serious breech of select cttee system ever. His integrity is now in question. Wed Mar 25 23:17:53 GMT 2015
Osborne brought Parliament into disrepute with his fake answers at the Treasury Select Committee. What else is he hiding? Wed Mar 25 23:14:37 GMT 2015
The change in media since 2010 election is phenomenal and unprecedented. Very  different campaign strategy to deal with this. Wed Mar 25 05:40:18 GMT 2015
Not very recognised: the Tory core vote is very soft. Much more than before. And are saying we don't know what to do. Unpredictable election Wed Mar 25 05:31:55 GMT 2015
For electionistas: it is clear that fewer people are registered to vote, but nearly all of these don't vote anyway. So % turnout higher. Wed Mar 25 05:24:09 GMT 2015

4 June 2005 and 16 March 2015 Shapps says he is full time MP, not working for his old business. In 2006 he is caught doing so. Time to go. Mon Mar 16 08:28:44 GMT 2015
Shapps says he confused dates. His post on Brookmans Park forum  of 4 June 2005 contradicts this entirely Mon Mar 16 08:13:22 GMT 2015

Virgin trains on East Coast running so late that travellers at Grantham end up on wrong train. Total chaos. 'Start of an amazing journey' Mon Mar 02 11:30:11 GMT 2015
Unable  to find how often local MP David Cameron has raised child sex abuse in Oxfordshire with the police and social services. Anyone know? Mon Mar 02 11:16:36 GMT 2015
One might have expected Virgin trains to clean the train before their inaugural Easy Coast service. Sadly not. Filthy. Mon Mar 02 11:14:39 GMT 2015

Strangely all those investigated for major criminality in banks are from within the same small group of bank staff who get huge bonuses. Thu Feb 26 07:54:14 GMT 2015
As we all own RBS, we can make it a mutual. Then we all can share its profits.  And there would be no need for huge bonuses. Thu Feb 26 07:52:32 GMT 2015
We own RBS. It makes a loss again. yet has a bonus pool bigger. What else could be usefully done with £400 million? Thu Feb 26 07:38:06 GMT 2015

The only question now is whether Rifkind resigns before he is pushed from security Cttee. He will not be there this time tomorrow. Mon Feb 23 22:51:47 GMT 2015

A zombie Parliament and yet government is running scared of a vote on waving official secrets act to help expose historical child abuse Mon Feb 23 12:49:19 GMT 2015
It may well be that government doesn't even allow debate on its own proposals on child sex exploitation. Instead 2 hours on abortion. Mon Feb 23 12:47:58 GMT 2015
Literally no time at all allocated to child sex exploitation and abuse legislation today. Government filibuster in proposed amendments. Mon Feb 23 12:46:53 GMT 2015

@BBCr4today old boys network at its very worst as Today gives Rifkind and Straw  the softest interviews imaginable . Where is Paxman? Mon Feb 23 08:30:29 GMT 2015
If Rifkind loses Tory whip his intelligence and security  committee position has to go as its a government committee position. Mon Feb 23 08:01:04 GMT 2015
Rifkind is hugely angry and irritated. The question is what about. Might be more soon later as Cameron has no choice but to withdraw whip Mon Feb 23 07:59:20 GMT 2015
Rifkind's arrogance is breathtaking. And he has not learned the Parliamentary rules as he is not 'self employed' Mon Feb 23 07:57:23 GMT 2015
@BBCr4today Rifkind claims he has nothing to be ashamed of. Let's put it to a public vite Mon Feb 23 07:18:50 GMT 2015
A national disgrace the Malcolm Rifkind has not resigned or had the Tory whip withdrawn Mon Feb 23 06:47:39 GMT 2015
As a Minister, Jack Straw was paid approaching  £1 million on top of his MPs pay. Presumably he was fearing poverty in retirement? Sun Feb 22 23:51:17 GMT 2015
Jack Straw says it is easier to do paid lobbying in the House of Lords. This is true. Which is why it should be abolished. Sun Feb 22 23:42:23 GMT 2015
Rifkind and Straw refer themselves to the commissioner who reports to the standards committee , comprising of, err, oh yes, other MPs Sun Feb 22 23:38:02 GMT 2015
Extraordinary that Rifkind has not resigned from Security Committee already. Who does he think he is kidding? Sun Feb 22 23:35:12 GMT 2015

Incredible that Dispatches can again find stupid greedy MPs. There is no excuse or apology that will be sufficient. Suspensions inevitable. Sun Feb 22 22:28:24 GMT 2015

What we learned from #bbcsp

⚠️Full fiscal autonomy means austerity max

⚠️SNP would borrow to fill £7.6bn gap

⚠️No answer on 2nd #indyref Sun Apr 12 12:18:13 BST 2015
Busy day of #LabourDooorstep and visits in Mount Vernon, Sandyhills + Baillieston. Lots of support after the debates. http://t.co/XbcMRob1D3 Sat Apr 11 20:27:09 BST 2015

I'm in London today for the meeting to decide Labour's manifesto for the election. Big day with big ideas for the future. #VoteLabour Thu Apr 09 13:57:08 BST 2015
Lots of passion from @JimForScotland tonight. Clear winner of the debate. @NicolaSturgeon's plans to bin Barnett exposed. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 22:03:07 BST 2015
During that question we learned that @NicolaSturgeon is committed to binning the Barnett Formula by May 2016. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:38:42 BST 2015
If I'm Scottish Secretary after May, I'll back Barnett Formula + more powers. Not billions cut with full fiscal autonomy. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:29:04 BST 2015
The SNP's full fiscal autonomy means that Scotland could no longer take advantage of UK wide taxes #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:26:23 BST 2015
Absolutely clear now that the SNP want full fiscal autonomy in the next year. That means £7.6bn of cuts next year. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:23:17 BST 2015
"You can't have social justice on the cheap...if you earn more than £150,000 we're going to put your taxes up" @JimForScotland Wed Apr 08 21:15:58 BST 2015
Nicola Sturgeon not the best advocate for the Barnett Formula. Her policy of full fiscal autonomy would see it end. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:12:33 BST 2015
Strong start from @JimForScotland setting out how we will end Tory austerity. #leadersdebate Wed Apr 08 21:05:27 BST 2015

Some coverage today in @TheEveningTimes about #olderwomenvoices discussion on @EverydaySexism with @OReillyMiriam. http://t.co/vJbJ4YJJhm Wed Apr 08 09:29:47 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland won that debate. He was the only person on stage with a plan for Scotland's working families. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:55:10 BST 2015
It always seems to be someone else's fault with @NicolaSturgeon. That isn't what she used to say. #ScotDebates http://t.co/vF2eRsvAIt Tue Apr 07 21:43:48 BST 2015
I've been campaigning in the East End + problems in the NHS have come up during every doorknocking session. Investment needed. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:38:04 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland: 1,000 more nurses in Scotland's NHS funded by a UK wide mansion tax #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:36:31 BST 2015
@AndyEMorrison No. I want high quality, high paid jobs instead of low quality, low paid ones. Tue Apr 07 21:15:35 BST 2015
.@willie_rennie again saying that jobs have been created. But 82% of jobs created have been in low pay industries. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:13:13 BST 2015
SNP said that #indyref was "once in a generation". What happened to the sovereign will of the Scottish people @NicolaSturgeon? #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:04:00 BST 2015
Things @NicolaSturgeon won't mention about education tonight: Thousands of places have been lost from Scotland's college. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 21:01:06 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland laid out a specific plan for working families. I didn't hear any detail in @NicolaSturgeon's answer. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:55:31 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland setting out @scottishlabour's plan. Progressive taxes to fund real change. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:45:16 BST 2015
@ClatchardCraig He said he would reverse the Tory's planned spending cuts. Tue Apr 07 20:38:22 BST 2015
.@RuthDavidsonMSP admitting that Tories will cut deeper in first 3 years of next Parliament than last 5. That's the Tory threat #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:35:53 BST 2015
.@RuthDavidsonMSP says jobs created. 82% of them are in low paid industries. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:30:23 BST 2015
.@NicolaSturgeon tells English to vote Green, Welsh to vote Plaid, Scots to vote SNP. That's not a recipe for Labour Government #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:23:14 BST 2015
.@NicolaSturgeon talks about ending austerity but the SNP Government are going to spend nothing extra in 2015 and 2016. Tue Apr 07 20:18:19 BST 2015
.@RuthDavidsonMSP and @willie_rennie running away from their party's records of hitting working families over past five years. Tue Apr 07 20:15:16 BST 2015
.@JimForScotland starts of by saying exactly who are his priority: working class people across Scotland. #ScotDebates Tue Apr 07 20:10:09 BST 2015

Thank you so much for joining us - #olderwomenvoices are not just online for an hour - let's keep talking about it and create change. Tue Apr 07 18:00:45 BST 2015
A lot of the online abuse I receive is ageist and sexist - #olderwomenvoices will not be silenced by cowardice. Tue Apr 07 17:51:03 BST 2015
@teapot12001 @EverydaySexism my age is a particular focus of criticism on my twitter feed from opponents! Tue Apr 07 17:49:26 BST 2015
How can we galvanise the women’s movement across all ages to fight for #olderwomenvoices? Tue Apr 07 17:45:46 BST 2015
@planetsnowglobe I get lots of ageist and sexist abuse on Twitter, scottish media covered this http://t.co/uKhOqXjok9 Tue Apr 07 17:44:17 BST 2015
We need more #olderwomenvoices to be heard and recognised - we need to take their experiences seriously. Tue Apr 07 17:39:33 BST 2015
We've seen some change in politics through quotas/positive action - maybe we need that in media too - thoughts? #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:37:28 BST 2015
The older women's commission I am working on will be researching and gathering views about making society fairer #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:35:08 BST 2015
when I was a girl and I asked why there were not women on TV - was told it was because nobody liked their high voices! #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:32:11 BST 2015
@andrenigel07 @EverydaySexism of course, there are barriers of class - we must over come those too. Tue Apr 07 17:29:58 BST 2015
@francesbell @everydaysexism Absolutely, we need an inclusive movement to tackle discrimination. Tue Apr 07 17:23:49 BST 2015
@janebinnion That's great to hear! Tue Apr 07 17:23:09 BST 2015
@francesbell It makes me wonder, why is it such a compliment to be told you look young for your age? #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:21:58 BST 2015
What do you want to see done in politics to change the dual ageism and sexism older women face? @everydaysexism #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:21:00 BST 2015
@DrSharronH There is some change, we need more older women in media and in politics. lots of work to do! Tue Apr 07 17:18:50 BST 2015
@tatteredstones @OReillyMiriam Great line but so sad that it is too often true. Tue Apr 07 17:17:06 BST 2015
@Mags2678 agreed. We need more women, in leadership positions. Tue Apr 07 17:16:14 BST 2015
@adamstevenson74 These are the issues we are researching on our older women's commission #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:14:51 BST 2015
@adamstevenson74 I think it's because women face discrimination - lots of older women report that their abilities are dismissed. Tue Apr 07 17:14:22 BST 2015
Which women over 50 would you like to see more of on our TV screens? #olderwomenvoices i'd like to see @OReillyMiriam! Tue Apr 07 17:12:36 BST 2015
Only 7% of the total TV workforce (on and off-screen) are women over the age of 50 -sexism on our screens #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:11:30 BST 2015
@planetsnowglobe I hope that's not the case, if so, they don't know what they are missing with all our underestimated abilities. Tue Apr 07 17:09:12 BST 2015
Some facts: 1. older women’s unemployment has risen by 30% since 2010 (but for men the same age has decreased) #olderwomenvoices  thoughts? Tue Apr 07 17:07:14 BST 2015
@SuggestDigest Illustrates the sexism women face, we must highlight it and tackle sexist discrimination at work. Tue Apr 07 17:05:45 BST 2015
older women become invisible in public life – I’m keen to hear why you think that is and your experiences #olderwomenvoices Tue Apr 07 17:01:49 BST 2015

Everyone should be able to get access to education. But too many working class kids in Scotland not getting chance because grants cut. Thu Apr 02 21:36:17 BST 2015

@Mr_JC_Denton Yes Tue Mar 03 09:53:33 GMT 2015
.@theSNP Twitter account spreading lies as usual. No ifs, no buts, no deal with the Tories. Anyone suggesting otherwise is talking nonsense. Tue Mar 03 09:42:13 GMT 2015

@The45Storm I didn't attend the ADS dinner. Tue Feb 10 22:44:02 GMT 2015
@golfingnuts I didn't. We voted to balance the budget, not for the Tories plans. Tue Feb 10 21:55:38 GMT 2015
NHS staff do a fantastic job, but even with great staff our A&Es are in crisis. Waiting time of 20 hours appalling. http://t.co/PdSbCQ31tO Tue Feb 10 21:54:55 GMT 2015

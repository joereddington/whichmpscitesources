I've tabled an amendment to the Tory backed motion on devolution. If they don't agree we'll be voting against it. It's bad for Scotland.
Congratulations to @NicolaSturgeon. Despite our differences, I hope we can work together in the best interests of the people of Scotland.
@jimwaterson Happy to Jim!

Thank you to every single member and supporter who has worked for a #LabourNo today and in past 2 years. You're a credit to Scotland.
Great to spend time with so many of our activists in Dalkeith, Edinburgh, Airdrie and Glasgow today. #LabourNo http://t.co/DCaZMp8tc7

Alex Salmond's entire campaign is based on a lie. He said to vote yes to protect NHS, but he's planning his own cuts. http://t.co/ffUYmCnoi3

.@AngusMacNeilMP didn't turn up to vote on bedroom tax today. This was his only contribution in Parliament this week: http://t.co/5A4Q8Qob1J
The SNP put their campaign ahead of the people of Scotland today. Only 2 SNP MPs turned up to vote against the bedroom tax. #LabourNo
I'm off the #indyref campaign trail today and back in Parliament to vote against the Bedroom Tax.
.@Ed_Miliband is right. The SNP are trying to con Labour voters. If you want to get rid of the Tories, vote no. #bbcgms #LabourNo

Great to visit Sorn Milk in Ayrshire today with @cathyjamieson and @CMochan. MD David shaw saying #nothanks. #indyref http://t.co/n4w6PrE3av
Scots still have no answers from Alex Salmond after #bbcindyref. Currency questions are about jobs, schools and hospitals, but no answers.
Alex Salmond doesn't want to answer questions about currency. So instead he's shouting over difficult questions. #bbcindyref
Labour will repeal bedroom tax. We've fought Tories on this and we forced the SNP to use powers of devolution to mitigate it. #bbcindyref
At end of that section still don't know Salmond's Plan B. Seems he would use the £ and leave Scotland without a central bank. #bbcindyref
This is crucial. Salmond trying to confuse with numbers. Alistair making clear what this means for our schools and hospitals. #bbcindyref
Absolutely no Plan B from Salmond on currency there. #nothanks #bbcindyref
Tonight we need proper answers from @AlexSalmond, not one liners. Real answers required on currency, jobs and spending. #bbcindyref
@SophyRidgeSky I'm hoping for proper answers about what indy means for people across Scotland, including Salmond's Plan B on currency.

.@Ed_Miliband is right. Alarm bells should be ringing after Tuesday night's debate. @AlexSalmond needs to spell out his currency plans.
@danieldjones Thanks Daniel! Was a great addition to @Glasgow2014
Thanks to all our #LabourNo activists across Scotland today, getting out the message that @AlexSalmond has no Plan B.Their tweets to follow.
I'm in Motherwell today. Message is simple: if you want to keep the pound, vote no in September. #LabourNo http://t.co/sqXGhDD0rj
Just about to talk to @BBCScot2014 about tonight's debate. #ScotDecides
#DarlingWin trends in Glasgow. And to think that Alex Salmond declared us a "Freedom City". No one steps on Glasgow. #ScotDecides
A clear #DarlingWin. @AlexSalmond lost because he had no answers for the audience, in the room or at home. #ScotDecides
Alex Salmond exposed under scrutiny. All slogans, absolutely no substance. #ScotDecides
The majority of Scots want oil revenues to be pooled and shared across the UK, according to social attitudes survey. #ScotDecides
"Yours for Scotland, Alex" #ScotDecides http://t.co/JNFvO3Unyx
A much needed ad break! #ScotDecides
Salmond being reduced to personal attacks and nonsense. Get serious! #ScotDecides
This question is too important to families the length and breadth of Scotland. What's Plan B @AlexSalmond? #ScotDecides
This is a master class in avoiding the question from Alex Salmond. But @TogetherDarling isn't going to let him away with it. #ScotDecides
Key question from @TogetherDarling: what's Plan B on the currency? Question people ask me everywhere across Scotland. #ScotDecides

Terribly sad news about David Maclennan. A great loss to Scottish Theatre
Alex Salmond doesn't get it. Scots' taxes aren't there to pay for advisers to smear. The code is clear. He has to take action. #fmqs
@iainmacwhirter that's no excuse
@iainmacwhirter but it included women so it applies
.@iainmacwhirter never tell women to grow up when responding to misogynistic abuse.
Great that @jk_rowling is supporting @UK_Together. Like many Scots, she's looked at the arguments and is saying no thanks on 18.09 #indyref
The attacks on Clare Lally are disgraceful. If proven, this is a gross abuse of Scottish Government resources and Alex Salmond needs to act.
MT @OliverMilne @PaulWheelhouse avoids the question. Again.No answer as to why we've missed targets 3 years running. http://t.co/YfT13xOBb2

With all results in for Scotland, clear we have work to do, but @scottishlabour has made steady progress while SNP support has stalled.
Results now official. Congratulations to @C_Stihler_MEP and @davidmartinmep - re-elected as @scottishlabour MEPs!
Rise of UKIP, in Scotland + elsewhere, shows we can't be complacent. People feel left out and politicians need to answer their concerns.

Scottish Labour's proposal today would have given some help to the 120,000 private rented households where people are living in poverty.
Another #fail today from the SNP Government, failing to stand up for those in private rental market squeezed by increasing rents.
Yesterday SNP voted against Labour's living wage plans. Today they have a chance to back our cap on private rents. Whose side are they on?
Good discussion with colleagues from other parts of UK today about our campaign and pledges for women. http://t.co/iWnWqc6jsL
Lively evening at scot bus awards. Very incisive questions from@alstewitn to @richardbranson
My reflections on John Smith, 20 years on from his death. He was a devolutionist, but never a Nationalist. http://t.co/SFlDJIt5YH
John Smith was a devolutionist,a patriotic Scot but never a Nationalist. Today we remember his commitment to working in solidarity across UK
Today we mark the 20th anniversary of the death of John Smith. In 1994, Labour lost a leader and the country lost a man of great integrity.
@jamesrally1961 thanks. And I'm not remotely bothered- quite amusing when they develop such fervour.
In letter to Ukranian community, no apology from Alex Salmond for Putin remarks. He should apologise now. He doesn't speak for Scots.

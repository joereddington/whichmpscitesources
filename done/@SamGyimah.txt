@smallbird31 do you mean literature. If so, on it's way. Fri Apr 24 19:12:27 BST 2015
Hmm. So Libya is such a concern for Miliband that he failed to mention it even once in his manifesto published BEFORE the recent tragedy! Fri Apr 24 18:20:23 BST 2015

@JuneOSullivan @bbc5live @Pre_schoolLA @NDNAtalk @EYTalking Our commitment to funding review, increasing hrly rate = listening to the sector Wed Apr 22 13:38:36 BST 2015
Next @bbc5live at 1.15pm to discuss with a nursery provider what we will do to help them deliver 30 hrs free childcare a week! Wed Apr 22 13:11:29 BST 2015
With our reforms to the min. wage,personal allowance & childcare, we are making it easier for families to work to provide 4 their children Wed Apr 22 11:58:16 BST 2015
Will be discussing our childcare pledge and how we'll support the early years sector to deliver it on  @daily_politics just after 12 noon. Wed Apr 22 11:42:48 BST 2015
@signoramac @eytalking Not appropriate going from 15 to 30 hrs per week (doubling the free entitlement) and not reviewing funding. Wed Apr 22 10:29:08 BST 2015
@adey_67 Childcare pledge to be funded by reducing tax relief on pension contributions for people earning more than £150,00 Wed Apr 22 09:51:11 BST 2015
@eytalking Consult on appropriate funding rate + funding formula, and look at whether LA top-slicing needs to standardised. Wed Apr 22 09:50:09 BST 2015
As part of our pledge to increase free hrs, we will review funding regime & increase hrly rate to ensure childcare sector is sustainable Wed Apr 22 09:34:20 BST 2015
Agree with @NDNAtalk analysis that w/out increase in funding rate & review of funding childcare sector can't cope with increase in free hrs Wed Apr 22 09:31:13 BST 2015

Has any Labour MP welcomed today's stonking job news showing 2m fellow citizens have a found a job and security of a pay packet since 2010. Fri Apr 17 15:48:30 BST 2015
While Miliband and other parties squabble, Conservatives are getting on with clearing Labour's mess, with 2million jobs created since 2010 Fri Apr 17 11:33:37 BST 2015
2 million jobs created since 2010 tells me we should stick with the plan and not let Ed Miliband drag this country back to square one. Fri Apr 17 11:27:10 BST 2015
Miliband's prediction that our plan would lead to 1m lost jobs proven wrong by Britain's businesses https://t.co/kv5ptsfLEd Fri Apr 17 11:14:17 BST 2015
@Oxted_Daily @CllrSimonA Lots happening on the gasholder. Pls email sam@samgyimah.com Fri Apr 17 11:04:43 BST 2015
Miliband had an opportunity to rule out working with Sturgeon and he didn't take it. Hopes SNP deal can smuggle him into No 10. #bbcddebate Thu Apr 16 21:22:40 BST 2015
Sturgeon says she will make Miliband PM if he adopts SNP policies for the UK. Unbelievable. #BBCDebates Thu Apr 16 21:15:38 BST 2015
The SNP will guarantee Labour doesn't get a majority. #bbcddebate Thu Apr 16 21:12:51 BST 2015
Labour record NHS = privatisation, MRSA, Mid Staffs. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:10:08 BST 2015
Sturgeon will drag Ed to the policies that made a mess of the country and ordinary families lives. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 21:03:52 BST 2015
So Sturgeon wants to break away from the UK while dictating who should be PM and what the policies should be. Recipe for chaos. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:53:26 BST 2015
Ed misleading the audience and rewriting history over Syria. He said no on Syria because he was terrified of his backbenchers. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:50:35 BST 2015
Can Ed say no anyone, Sturgeon included. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:48:09 BST 2015

@wdjstraw @GregHands It's the challengers debate, in case you hadn't noticed. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:41:08 BST 2015
Miliband has lost control if debate. Farage is drawing it onto his territory. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:39:13 BST 2015
Is Ed still in the debate? Haven't heard anything from him in a while #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:36:49 BST 2015
Farage and Sturgeon dominating debate so far. Miliband flat-footed. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:35:57 BST 2015
Sturgeon has disagreed with Ed on the deficit, the NHS, housing. So why does she want him as PM? Bcos she will be in charge #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:33:51 BST 2015
Miliband getting lots of a attention and airtime, but clear he cannot impose himself on this coalition of chaos. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:30:26 BST 2015
We've just had a peek into what coalition negotiations between Sturgeon and Miliband would be like -chaos! #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:26:00 BST 2015
Sturgeon nails Eds fiscal plan, paraphrasing that IFS quote: if people vote Labour, they do not know what they are voting for" #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:24:52 BST 2015
Nicola wants to work with Ed. Ed wants to work with Nicola but is scared of her. Recipe for chaos.#BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:22:30 BST 2015
Sturgeon is on fire. Can Ed really stand up to her? I think not. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:21:22 BST 2015
There we have it! Sturgeon dismisses Ed Miliband's fiscal plan. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:20:19 BST 2015
Labour's  manifesto not worth the paper it is written on. Sturgeon will dictate the terms to Ed. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:19:33 BST 2015
Sturgeon nails Miliband on the NHS. The Labour plan does not fully fund the NHS. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:18:03 BST 2015
Ed Miliband is addicted to debt. His plan will leave a deficit of £30bn at the end if the next parliament.#BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:16:20 BST 2015
@2007Molly Have you got a postal vote? If not it may be why you haven't received one. Thu Apr 16 20:13:32 BST 2015
Ed Miliband is not committed to reducing the deficit. He voted against every cut in the last parliament. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:11:18 BST 2015
Great first question on #BBCDebate. The next generation will pay the price of failing to reduce the deficit Thu Apr 16 20:09:14 BST 2015
Ed Miliband is wrong. David Cameron was not invited to challengers debate. #BBCDebate Thu Apr 16 20:06:18 BST 2015

Labour doubled income tax for the poorest when it abolished the 10p tax band. Anyone on that tax band is now paying no income tax at all. Mon Apr 13 18:34:21 BST 2015
@DannyBraverman Good news! Inequality reached a record high b/n '07 and '10. Under this gov't it's fallen to the lowest level since 1986. Mon Apr 13 18:30:45 BST 2015
Balls & Miliband are junkies: addicted to more borrowing, more taxes and more debt, which got our country into a mess. Let's not risk it! Mon Apr 13 09:47:15 BST 2015

The point Ed Miliband still doesn't get. #leadersdebate #justnotuptoit http://t.co/zx3991NIvy Thu Apr 02 22:23:16 BST 2015
Cameron's advantage is he has a track record in gov't to be proud of. Miliband's couldn't ignore Labour's mess. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:14:46 BST 2015
Jeremy Paxman was right. Miliband will be a disaster if he had to negotiate against Putin. #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 22:04:41 BST 2015

Ed Miliband is represents chaos not change. #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:56:04 BST 2015
Ed Miliband and Ed Balls cannot represent change. Together with Gordon Brown they were the architects of the Great Recession.#justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:54:35 BST 2015
Classic Labour Party. Not practicing what they preach on zero hours contracts. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:49:55 BST 2015
The SNP want £148bn more debt, unlimited benefits and Trident scrapped -putting our national security at risk. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:48:32 BST 2015
Farage not saying much now. Clearly a 'one club golfer' with no plan for all the different challenges our country faces. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:45:09 BST 2015

Another straight answer from Sturgeon. She will keep Ed Miliband 'honest'. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:41:48 BST 2015
Hypocrisy from Miliband. His policy of more spending, more borrowing and more taxes will cripple future generations. #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:40:47 BST 2015

Miliband cannot escape failure of the last Labour gov't and his lack of a plan shows he is #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:34:47 BST 2015
Cameron clearly in charge answering questions with policy, not waffle and rhetoric. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:33:49 BST 2015
Ed Miliband, we are going through hard times because of the mess Labour left. We are all paying the price of Labour's failure.#leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:30:52 BST 2015

Miliband waffling as this debate is focused on the tough choices and clear plan needed to secure Britain's future. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:27:21 BST 2015
Cameron reminds Ed Miliband that the last Labour govt left a note saying 'there was no money', that's why we've had cuts. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:26:03 BST 2015
A plan that creates 1000 jobs a day, giving people security of a wage to get on in life is a plan that is working. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:24:07 BST 2015
Cameron going at Miliband on tax and spending. Miliband's weakest point because he won't say which taxes he wi raise. #leadersdabate Thu Apr 02 20:19:40 BST 2015
Nigel Farage's numbers simply do not add up. #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 20:16:15 BST 2015
David Cameron committed to no new tax rises. Which taxes will Ed Miliband tell us which taxes he will raise. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:15:15 BST 2015
How can Miliband say he is interested in working people, when Labour's mess is what has hurt working people. #Leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:13:21 BST 2015
David Cameron making it clear our balanced plan is working. Strong stuff. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:12:20 BST 2015
Ed Miliband did not talk about a clear plan for the economy. How will he make Britain better. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:11:20 BST 2015
“@MattHancock2015: Hold on Ed Miliband - living standards now higher than five years ago & min wage on track for over £8 #leadersdebate” Thu Apr 02 20:10:30 BST 2015
Miliband stumbling. #leadersdabate Thu Apr 02 20:09:44 BST 2015
Britain can do better than the mess Labour left our country in. David Cameron nails it. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:08:53 BST 2015
Nicola Sturgeon clearly wants a return to the policies that got us into a mess in the first place: more debt, higher taxes. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:07:11 BST 2015
Nigel Farage also didn't mention jobs or the economy. 15 years as MEP and posing as anti-establishment. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:05:30 BST 2015
Nathalie Bennett doesn't seem to realise our country is just recovering from Labour's great recession. No mention of jobs #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:04:05 BST 2015
Retweet if you don't want Labour to wreck our recovering economy #leadersdebate http://t.co/2eIsVxaUpe Thu Apr 02 20:00:56 BST 2015

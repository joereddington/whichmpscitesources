Attended @MayorofLondon launch of Air Quality manifesto. Work of @CommonsEAC recognised. @CllrMichaellunn also present - Quality of Life.
Instead of speculating wildly about fracking, why doesn't Stroud Labour concentrate on protecting the Valleys & Vale by having a Local Plan?
Valleys & Vale isn't area to frack - AONB, floods & geology conspire against, but cheap sources help to tackle #fuelpoverty & energy supply

Just spoken on Ukrainian situation in a Commons debate notable for cross-party support. Russia's aggressive behaviour must be restrained.
@bearded_tit - working for the Stroud Valleys and Vale is my priority, all of the time. @SVPcharity @StroudsWebs @StroudFestival @StroudCF
@steve4319 @stroudnews - #NPPF is a framework for local plans but, without a plan, Stroud is vulnerable to unwanted development by appeal.
@steve4319 @stroudnews - the #NPPF is a framework for local plans, but, without a plan, Stroud is now vulnerable to unwanted developments.

@AndySawfordMP
@goatteeboy yes I do Ian Sun Apr 26 20:46:04 BST 2015
@ian_gow oh Ian, don't be daft, your council tax and services are all in the hands of Tories. If you're unhappy, stop voting for them Sun Apr 26 18:06:43 BST 2015
@ian_gow I'm not your MP right now Ian. Vote for me on May 7th and of course I will fight for a fair deal for all of my constituency Sun Apr 26 10:00:45 BST 2015
Good to see Ed treating Bullingdon Boris like the joker he is. #marr Sun Apr 26 09:59:47 BST 2015
@Markfergusonuk I noticed that Mark. The ringing phone question was particularly silly too Sun Apr 26 09:46:57 BST 2015
@ian_gow no. If you are dissatisfied with Tory ENDC, NCC and Police Commissioner, join me in telling them to give Oundle a fair deal Sun Apr 26 09:36:37 BST 2015
@ian_gow try to change who runs the council Sun Apr 26 08:09:33 BST 2015
@ian_gow because they take it for granted that Oundle will vote Tory, despite your Tory Council giving a poor service Sun Apr 26 07:42:53 BST 2015

@ThomasWPenny they like the union, they have progressive values, they are mostly voting Labour Tue Apr 21 10:12:30 BST 2015
Another positive reason to vote Labour http://t.co/jDH7ZFhI43 Tue Apr 21 10:11:53 BST 2015

Musical finish to @marrshow was 'Getaway Car'.  Very appropriate for Cameron after that terrible interview #marr #marrshow Sun Apr 19 10:01:45 BST 2015
Cameron defending the welfare sanctions, bedroom tax and nearly a million people using foodbanks. #marrshow Sun Apr 19 09:49:30 BST 2015
It's all fear and smear from Cameron on #marrshow. He has no vision for the future. Sun Apr 19 09:42:37 BST 2015

@PeterJLuff So you concede Cameron is telling fibs today.  Re NHS, did you not vote for Lansley's privatisation push? Mon Mar 30 08:33:34 BST 2015
When Cameron talks about sacrifice, I wonder what sacrifice He has made compared to those hit by the bedroom tax Mon Mar 30 08:04:04 BST 2015
The choice is clear - even bigger Tory spending cuts or balancing the books in a fairer way http://t.co/Sj3oa1inqs Mon Mar 30 08:02:06 BST 2015

No knockout, but a clear win on points. Ed was candid, funny, tough. Hell, he even roughed up Paxo a bit #BatleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:28:20 GMT 2015
Questions about the last Labour government. Did you rescue the NHS. Yes! #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:15:02 GMT 2015
Paxo's questions seem 5 years out of date #BatleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 22:13:14 GMT 2015
That's the difference. Ed wanted more time, more questions where Cameron wanted it to finish. #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 22:05:25 GMT 2015
Kay Burley might get some stick for the very different way she is handling the two leaders #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 21:57:32 GMT 2015
Audience member on "no top down re-organisation" broken promise. Right to highlight this. #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:40:57 GMT 2015
The patronisation index is at Cringe Level #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 21:34:13 GMT 2015
DC seems to be trying to talk this out and avoid too many questions being asked.  #runningscared Thu Mar 26 21:32:24 GMT 2015
DC talks about difficult decisions. Difficult for students, patients, armed forces, sure start users... #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 21:31:15 GMT 2015
Talking about older citizens, DC needs to be honest about the massive scale of social care cuts on his watch #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 21:28:06 GMT 2015
@paulwaugh ok-ish is a generous assessment Paul Thu Mar 26 21:23:53 GMT 2015
DC on the ropes. Hope Paxo asks about the NHS - privatisation and wasteful top-down reorganisation #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:18:10 GMT 2015
On where welfare cuts will come from: "do you know and you're not telling us, or do you not know". Fair question. DC waffles #BattleforNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:16:14 GMT 2015
"You said one thing and did another" says Paxo. DC failed on deficit, on immigration, on NHS 'no reorganisation' #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:14:11 GMT 2015
Cameron told Paxo twice before the election he wouldn't raise VAT. When he was elected he put it up #BattleForNumber10 Thu Mar 26 21:12:19 GMT 2015
Cameron is finding this much harder than when his Bullingdon bully boys are shouting behind him #BattleForNo10 Thu Mar 26 21:10:55 GMT 2015
Cameron's government is borrowing more and has failed on the deficit #BattleForNo10 #whyDCwon'tDebate Thu Mar 26 21:09:46 GMT 2015
Foodbanks and zerohours. Paxo hits on just a few of the reasons Cameron won't debate Thu Mar 26 21:06:34 GMT 2015

Commons opposition microphone not working was down to gremlins in the system we are told, rather than Lynton's dirty tricks. Mon Mar 16 15:08:18 GMT 2015

@GABaines  DUP have a point. They maybe should have stuck with leaders of UK wide parties, but it's for the broadcasters to take a view Fri Mar 06 19:41:43 GMT 2015
Damn you auto correct.  That was profoundly "undemocratic" Fri Mar 06 19:39:06 GMT 2015
@GABaines Ed has said he will debate the Leaders the broadcasters invite Fri Mar 06 19:38:00 GMT 2015
It would be completely wrong and profoundly in democratic to allow one Leader to dictate all the terms of debates to everyone else. Fri Mar 06 19:36:39 GMT 2015
Good to see the broadcasters holding firm.  The Prime Minister has been a bit like those badgers shifting the goalposts. Fri Mar 06 19:34:49 GMT 2015
@NeneLocal yes of course, very happy to, I am in Thrapston regularly. Can you email to fix a date andy.sawford.mp@parliament.uk Thu Mar 05 21:03:03 GMT 2015
@sallief1 yes I definitely will Thu Mar 05 21:01:51 GMT 2015

It's so typically arrogant of Cameron to presume he can dictate the terms of election debates. Wed Mar 04 22:15:54 GMT 2015
Pathetic of David Cameron to blame the broadcasters over the election debate negotiations.  The truth is he is frit. Wed Mar 04 22:11:18 GMT 2015

Financially illiterate? That'll be the same Vince Cable who promised NO tuition fees in 2010. Now attacks Labour cut from £9k to £6k Fri Feb 27 08:52:25 GMT 2015
@cllrjoncollins we should aim to integrate health and social care everywhere, with that integration led locally, not from the centre Thu Feb 26 13:35:33 GMT 2015
@roddytherobot yes I do question what the Tory motive is. Bringing health and social care together is good though as long as its funded Wed Feb 25 18:43:08 GMT 2015
@UtopianFireman was good to chat with you too Wed Feb 25 18:05:02 GMT 2015

@votepursglove re the KC hustings, will you now do the decent thing and retract and apologise please. Wed Feb 25 09:25:21 GMT 2015
@miss_traceydav yes it shows some very worthwhile campaigns - my mate  @SarahChampionMP has been a real star Tue Feb 24 22:15:53 GMT 2015
@miss_traceydav I didn't get involved in the filming, prefer to talk to local media about local issues, but it's an interesting programme Tue Feb 24 22:11:23 GMT 2015
@ChappersDave that's great, hope it goes well for him Tue Feb 24 20:55:43 GMT 2015

@VotePursglove @MargotLJParker yes of course, I'll answer questions and discuss any issues that people want to raise Tue Feb 24 11:36:23 GMT 2015
@VotePursglove I think we can disagree without being disagreeable. #CorbyEN voters will respect us more for that. Tue Feb 24 11:22:43 GMT 2015
@VotePursglove please retract that tweet Tom. It isn't true and I don't think voters in #CorbyEN will appreciate personal attacks Tue Feb 24 11:16:28 GMT 2015
@MargotLJParker @VotePursglove rubbish, I have offered a range of dates and am waiting to hear back Tue Feb 24 11:11:13 GMT 2015

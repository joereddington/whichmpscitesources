@Shenagh55  It's an EN Council decision. You've got to make the Tories listen. But they support stealth privatisation of woodlands.

@Shenagh55 I visit and represent all communities. Whereabouts are you?
@DaisyPage07 congratulations on your win from a former Littlebrook Councillor. I was very proud to represent the ward alongside John
Rural survey and #labourdoorstep this morning in Brigstock #CorbyEN #6monthstowin http://t.co/US3dQZd4Mi
With #6monthstowin @Ed_Miliband says "I am willing to put up with whatever is thrown at me, in order to fight for you"
Crisp morning #labourdoorstep in Brigstock #CorbyEN.  Good feedback, people pleased to see us out and about in the villages #6monthstowin
Good that @Ed_Miliband is putting zero-zero economy on notice. Workers on zero hours while those at the top pay zero tax #6monthstowin
If you want an economy that works for everyone, not just the privileged few, then join Labour and help us #6monthstowin
If you believe in the NHS and want to save it from Tory privatisation then join Labour and help us #6monthstowin
If you believe the UK should look forward and outward to the world, not backward and inward, then join Labour and help us #6monthstowin

@IanJacobs1957 @BBCr4today extraordinary again, e.g the European Arrest Warrant report led with "DowningSt says it was Labour's fault"
Blog about my visit to @AluminiumShapes to discuss their £300k growth plans. A real manufacturing success story http://t.co/96HnYVgKGf
@jimstel49 And I thought Corby @PoppyLegion did brilliantly with the organisation
@jimstel49 it was played at the service as in previous years and we sang both verses in full voice
Tory Sir Richard Shepherd denounces 'executive arrogance' of the government  whose actions have brought the Commons into disrepute
Government backbenchers are furious, denouncing the 'chicanery' & 'trickery' by the Home Secretary. It's a disaster for Chief Whip Gove
Strong rebuff to the Government by the Speaker about the "contemptuous" way the EAW vote has been handled
Farcical scenes in the Commons as the Government backs out of a vote on the European Arrest Warrant
@ladylyn54 never believe anything in the Daily Mail
Nice to meet lots of residents in Gretton this morning and good to see how the village shop is thriving #Labourdoorstep
@mwoolf007 thanks
#WWENottingham http://t.co/vQU0oTDCOL
Thanks to grassroots supporters who led tonight's fightback. After a week of media contrived division you have shown that #webackEd
1) We reject the Tory dirty war & media nonsense. 2) Solidarity is why we are Labour. 3) Ed will be a great PM. #webackEd
@MrsBuhweet @JusticeforLB I promise to look at it and respond, but I need to read the Bill and understand it properly

@BBCr4today get some perspective. The PLP has the same few malcontents. Cameron's MPs are switching party and fighting by-elections.

Delighted to win the vote for Railways (Public Sector Operators) Bill to go forward. Thanks to @UKLabour colleagues for strong support
@AndyMcDonaldMP thanks Andy
@xLevel today in parliament I will highlight the difference between the two operators serving my constituents, particularly on price rises
@xLevel mainly @EMTrains but sometimes @eastcoastuk which is used by my constituents on the eastern side of #CorbyEN 1/2
Will highlight @CoopParty idea for a 'people's railway' too when I move my #RailBill today at 12.30 in the Commons
Public owned East Coast has been a real success but the Tories are obsessed with re-privatising it #RailBill http://t.co/mgKkJbzgOP
Today I will move a Bill in Parliament to permit a public operator for our railways.   RT if you support http://t.co/8aLwuzDMy1
Good to talk to @BBCNorthampton about Fire Service changes - here is the consultation link http://t.co/vSaUz1udtz

@RobGoughy nah. But I'm going to use your arrogant line that I am a "squatter occupying a Tory seat" to further fire up my members
@anthonydady @stjohnscorby agree our faith communities contribute a great deal. I am proud to be Patron of Raunds St Peter's Church
Despite success on #eastcoast govt is blocking a public option for our railways. My Bill would make it possible http://t.co/Z0UdqOF1rr

@jimstel49 and by the way, I go knocking doors week in week out. Don't presume that what you think is what everyone else thinks

About to talk to @Stuart_Linnell on @BBCNorthampton about ambulance services

What a joker Nick Clegg is. Posing as a mental health champion, while his govt destroys mental health services in Northamptonshire.

@sinith99 @Eddie_Raunds shift workers at home in the day, parents at home, pensioners, you don't think they matter?
@guychilvers you want two Parliaments then ?
@CEPMember I say this as a believer in politics but I'm 99% sure that the last thing people want is a whole load more politicians
@CEPMember @guychilvers two lots of MPs, two parliaments, two governments!  No way my constituents want this!
@guychilvers deficit would be cut in 2015 - which didn't happen because he choked recovery - so why believe 2018 false promises?
@guychilvers ok, let's look at the tax cuts false promise then. Cam says this will happen when deficit cut in 2018, but he used to say...
@CEPMember @guychilvers at least this guy is honest on EVEL but I'm certain that people in England don't want two Parliaments
@guychilvers when is the Prime Minister acting as UK PM or England First Minister?  And surely it's not right that only Eng MP could be PM?
@guychilvers two budgets? One for UK and one for England?
@guychilvers what about London MPs - lots of devolved matters to London, so would they sit half in and half out of EVEL plan?
@guychilvers and presumably then only English MPs could take the senior UK Ministerial roles?
@guychilvers if not separate parliament or government, would the chancellor be English finance Minister, Home Sec = England police minister?
@guychilvers if it's not a separate Parliament, would there be a separate government?  Two lots of Ministers?!
@guychilvers it's spin, they haven't got a proper plan!
@guychilvers beyond the simplistic spin, how is your EVEL proposal going to work - a separate English Parliament? Two lots of MPs?!
@JamesWThurston yes, that's the Tory plan - more cuts to PCSOs, teaching assistants,  lollipop ladies (and gents), youth work, mental health
2/2 now they say tax cuts IF they tackle deficit by 2018. More Tory false promises and more pain for the many while they look after the few
Tories said they'd get rid of deficit by 2015.  Of course it didn't happen because they choked off recovery 1/2
2/2 Cameron promised no re-organisation of NHS then imposed one from the top down to break up & sell off to Tory private healthcare donors
Cameron cross he's been found out on the NHS - going blue in the face won't make anyone believe him 1/2
@huwsilk @AlisonBagley1 @davidtjackson @michaelwhelan1 @HuwSilkNT can confirm it's not me

When you need Grant Shapps to steady the ship you know you're in trouble
@Lifelandlady I shuddered
Seeing UKIP giddily tweeting links to the Mail on Sunday it struck me - voting UKIP is like asking the Daily Mail to run the country
@MargotLJParker are you going to give them a say on bear-baiting too?
@Topcat36 it won't come to that if you vote Labour next May to #Keepcrueltyhistory
@MargotLJParker it's clear then in #CorbyEN if you agree hunting is cruelty and should be consigned to the history books #voteLabour
3/3 a Tory majority government would bring back hunting - cruelty for fun. One more reason to get out campaigning on the #labourdoorstep
2/3 "We need to make sure that we have the votes to be able to do that." - Tory plan to repeal Hunting ban
Tory Cabinet Minister Liz Truss in the Sunday Express: "I think it was a mistake, the Hunting Act, and I would vote for repeal." 1/3
@JamesBarkerYL very happy to meet, can you email Andy.sawford.mp@parliament.uk to arrange

2/2 elections were a farce, it's wrong to politicise policing, and it's wasting money in Northants where the PCC spends £1.5 m on his office

@Margaret_Curran thanks for what you've done Margaret - and special thanks for coming and listening to little Scotland's voice #LabourNo
@UKLabour has already set out detailed plans for massive devolution to local areas across England http://t.co/mThP4yeXiM
Devolution in England means transferring powers out from Westminster to communities - not an introspective discussion about Parliament
The turnout is incredible. Huge credit to the campaigns and to the voters for taking this awesome responsibility so seriously
Taking great comfort from Peter Kellner prediction of 54% No vote based on poll today with large sample

Have just sent out this week's newsletter. Bedroom tax - the beggining of the end http://t.co/PcGJZVcAvD http://t.co/DksLmimx4D
@Ed_Miliband on the SNP's failure to vote on the #bedroomtax http://t.co/8uANqIgZGd
2/2 @MargotLJParker as for Solway, some jobs saved and many were helped to find new employment. Corby expects their MP to help not carp
@MargotLJParker disappointing approach re KP Margot. Of course it's right to talk to the company rather than just name calling 1/2
Congratulations to @CorbyRadio on the renewal of your licence. I know you'll keep on being a great community run radio station
Well done to @labourwhips team on today's #bedroomtax votes. Scale of Tory defeats clearly shocked them
Labour's campaign to end the #bedroomtax takes a step forward today but to abolish it fully we need a Labour government
Labour's Northants PPCs @kevinmckeever @Sally_Keeble @votegarvie @RheaKeehn @CampbellAbigail & Lucy Mills would vote to end #bedroomtax
Northamptonshire has 7 MPs. They all have an opportunity to vote to end the misery of the bedroom tax today.  Watch them.
@ChrisBryantMP uses an excellent phrase for this government's approach: "policy based evidence making"
Knowing the pain it's caused my constituents I find it difficult to watch the Tories laughing about the #bedroomtax
Tories used to say #bedroomtax SAVED money. 
Today they claim some limited exemptions will COST £1billion. 
Doesn't add up
@sandra_mole yes I am here now in the Commons now
If the government won’t ditch its hated Bedroom Tax, then the next Labour government will @UKLabour  http://t.co/WubJIu6jHN
On my way to Westminster to vote on the horrible #bedroomtax which has caused misery to many of my constituents
2/2 wonder if Osborne spoke to workers at Weetabix who have had their pay cut and are very much suffering from the cost of living crisis
News from two big Corby employers of redundancies comes on a day when complacent George Osborne comes to town boasting 1/2
2/2 will talk with both companies to see if any jobs can be saved, and if not to help make sure people get support to find new jobs
Very sad to hear from KP Foods that they are closing the factory in Corby and BAT are also losing jobs in town too 1/2

New Tory Housing Minister should check the facts.  More houses were built in EVERY year of the last Labour govt than ANY year of this govt
Labour Councils are already showing the way by building many more homes than in Tory areas but we need government to back housebuilding too
#thechoice on housing: with Labour it's Help to Build to back smaller house builders & help for those who rent with more stable tenancies
#thechoice on housing - with Tories it's lowest housebuilding now since 1920s and lowest home ownership since 1980s

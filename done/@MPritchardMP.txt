As sure as the sun rises in the East - and sets in the West - the UK's economy is not safe in Labour's hands. Mon Apr 27 08:14:32 BST 2015
Conservatives have lowered corporation tax for job creating businesses. Ed Balls wants to reverse that. The economy is not safe with Labour. Mon Apr 27 07:54:35 BST 2015
A beautiful day in Shropshire. Cacophony of chorus from the county's bird species. Cuckoo competing with Woodpeckers for Spring decibels. Mon Apr 27 07:39:14 BST 2015
Low politics from Ed Miliband. UK intervention in Libya stopped a genocide. Further, most migrants are not from Libya! Fri Apr 24 10:04:40 BST 2015
Late last night parliament sat in Shropshire. Not the Acton Burnell Parliament of 1283 - but a parliament of noisy barn owls! Thu Apr 23 11:07:37 BST 2015
SNP have gone power mad. Asking for support from English voters when SNP are not even on ballot paper! Supreme arrogance. Mon Apr 20 17:36:03 BST 2015
Helping failed states far more expensive than fragile states. Failure causes forced mass migration. DFID budget helps reduce failure. Mon Apr 20 17:22:14 BST 2015
Think of Little #Malta when looking at ways to tackle African mass migration. Malta needs support as well as Italy. Mon Apr 20 13:09:54 BST 2015
Folks expect UKIP MEPs also standing for election to Westminster to represent UK interests in Strasbourg & Brussels when they meet next week Mon Apr 20 11:01:11 BST 2015
UKIP want to scrap the UK's aid budget This would increase conflicts, disease, famine & mass migration. Aid budget smart & right thing to do Mon Apr 20 10:56:23 BST 2015
Received lovely leaflet from Labour PPC for South Staffs today, but I live in Shropshire! Would help if Staffordshire was spelt correctly. Fri Apr 17 16:25:39 BST 2015
Ed Balls calls 'no money left' note left by Labour's last Chief Secretary to Treasury a "joke". Sadly the joke is on hard working families! Thu Apr 16 12:54:23 BST 2015
Great irony of @UKIP, a tragic irony, is that in most seats a vote for UKIP will end any prospect of an EU Referendum. Vote Conservative! Thu Apr 16 12:51:18 BST 2015
Glad to support work of @TelfordVolServe at the Glebe Centre, Wellington. Also a good location for charity meetings. http://t.co/TSpNGbe6nU Thu Apr 16 12:27:34 BST 2015

Well done @DailyMailUK  for highlighting the plight of white rhinos. Cons have done much to reduce illegal wildlife trade. More to do. Thu Apr 16 10:41:32 BST 2015
Just met a lovely 90 year old lady in Newport over a cup of tea. She said if Ed Miliband becomes PM she will "emigrate". Says it all! Tue Apr 14 14:28:04 BST 2015
Honoured to be visiting Combat Stress in Newport again. Staff and volunteers do a great job in caring for veterans young & old Tue Apr 14 14:09:00 BST 2015

Looks like mortgage rates would rise under a Labour government. Leading to rent increases and less disposable income for folks and economy. Tue Apr 14 09:01:04 BST 2015
Rachel Reeves fails to match Conservatives £8bn extra funding for NHS on BBC PM Programme. Labour admit they will under-fund NHS by £5.5bn Mon Apr 13 17:30:14 BST 2015
Labour Shadow Cabinet Minister confirms that Labour's NHS plans will create £5.5bn funding shortfall for local hospitals - on BBC Radio 4 Mon Apr 13 17:19:43 BST 2015
@andybell5news ha ha - April Fool's Day has gone! Mon Apr 13 12:42:47 BST 2015
Bias Alert: BBC Radio Shropshire get it wrong again (mistake?) Last Labour government introduced "managed competition" into NHS at 3.6% Mon Apr 13 11:16:19 BST 2015
Labour say they will cut the deficit every year. This from the "fiscally irresponsible" Party.  Record shows they increased it year on year Mon Apr 13 10:04:42 BST 2015
When is an Independent not an "Independent" ? Check out the Borough Councillors who are propping up failed Labour policies at TWBC Mon Apr 13 09:59:05 BST 2015
Hikes in costs of borrowing as Labour fail to tackle deficit. This economic failure would mean far higher mortgage payments for Wrekin folks Mon Apr 13 09:13:09 BST 2015
Nigel Farage and Douglas Carswell doing a walkabout together today. Will it be a Blair v Brown ice cream moment? #GE2015 Mon Apr 13 08:31:48 BST 2015

I will fight any plans by UKIP to scrap #West Mercia police. Joint working with Warwicks fine - but scrapping completely - no way UKIP! Sat Apr 11 20:42:23 BST 2015
"@AlexForsythBBC: Leader @Nigel_Farage says UKIP would 'rationalise' the 43 police forces". So goodbye West Mercia police under UKIP. Awful! Sat Apr 11 20:39:39 BST 2015
As Sudanese guards protect the last remaining northern white rhino on earth the #Chinese govt need to take action against illegal hunters Sat Apr 11 20:34:40 BST 2015
Growing economy creates new jobs and businesses - each producing tax receipts - which in turn pays for public services - like the NHS Sat Apr 11 12:29:32 BST 2015
The announcement of an additional £8 Billion for the NHS from the Conservatives is entirely consistent with David Cameron's "NHS, NHS, NHS" Sat Apr 11 12:23:07 BST 2015
Venezeula should not make Cuba choose between Venezeula & United States. It may not like Castro's choice. Time for change in Venezeula too Sat Apr 11 12:18:08 BST 2015

@ChrisBryant4MP A seat we will win back - do you agree? Sat Apr 11 08:56:33 BST 2015
Labour wrong footed by Conservatives NHS funding pledge. Only a strong economy can deliver a strong NHS Labour would wreck the economy again Sat Apr 11 08:53:18 BST 2015
Conservative Campaign going to plan and schedule. Manifesto launch will boost poll ratings further - along with other eye catching policies Sat Apr 11 08:44:19 BST 2015

Will Nebraska or Kansas be first Red State to abolish death penalty? Is there an inconsistency in being pro-life but keeping death penalty? Thu Apr 09 19:36:44 BST 2015
National politics is not 'Little League' - it's Big League If Miliband can't take a bit of flak in an election - then he needs to toughen up Thu Apr 09 15:53:01 BST 2015
Labour cannot offer careers advice if there are no jobs created. Only a strong economy under a Conservative government will provide careers Thu Apr 09 15:49:57 BST 2015
Labour have not committed to 4 submarines. Douglas Alexander said Labour 'would look at it in government'. That is not a commitment Thu Apr 09 13:05:12 BST 2015

Simple question: In an uncertain world who would the UK's enemies most like to see in 10 Downing St on May 8th - Cameron or Miliband? Thu Apr 09 09:32:45 BST 2015
An uncomfortable fact, Ed Miliband was a Cabinet Minister in the last Labour govt, who left a £38Billion black hole in nation's defences Thu Apr 09 09:29:26 BST 2015
In an unsafe world Ed Miliband, held to ransom by SNP, wants to weaken the UK's nuclear deterrent. The UK's enemies are rubbing their hands! Thu Apr 09 08:25:24 BST 2015
Defence of realm first priority of any government. Without a strong economy you cannot have strong defence. Four Trident subs are a must! Thu Apr 09 08:21:04 BST 2015
Farage is making a habit of entering buildings via the back door. A vote for UKIP will also allow Ed Miliband into No10 via the same door! Wed Apr 08 17:19:17 BST 2015
Labour's economic policy appears to have been written on the back of a fag packet - a blank/plain packet! Wed Apr 08 17:07:54 BST 2015
Ed Balls already in huge disagreement with Ed Miliband. Blair v Brown was bad for Britain. The two Eds would also be bad. Chaos under Labour Wed Apr 08 17:05:50 BST 2015
Labour cannot be trusted to safeguard NHS in Midlands Wasn't it on their watch, or lack of watching, that horrors of Staffordshire happened! Tue Apr 07 17:22:39 BST 2015
Average 93.6% in England for A&E wait deserves a cheer for all hard working nurses, doctors & support staff. That's A★ grade anywhere else! Tue Apr 07 17:18:09 BST 2015
Britain under Labour would be like France under Hollande. Higher taxes, more debt, and an economy in chaos! Tue Apr 07 11:04:03 BST 2015
Tony Blair wrong. UK is not a "parochial bystander". UK exporting more now. A global player. Reformed UKTI doing a huge amount for UK plc Tue Apr 07 11:02:13 BST 2015
Blair wrong to accuse those who want to leave EU as having a "mean spirit". Whether right or wrong - those folks are entitled to their views Tue Apr 07 11:00:36 BST 2015
No new arguments or rationale in Tony Blair's speech in seeking to deny the British people a say on Europe. Same lines...... Tue Apr 07 10:54:50 BST 2015
Blair says EU Referendum will be a "horrible process". Isn't this the same Tony Blair who sanctioned referenda for less important decisions! Tue Apr 07 10:48:42 BST 2015
So Tony Blair doesn't trust the British people to make the "sensible choice" when it comes to giving folks a say on Europe. Trust the people Tue Apr 07 10:43:51 BST 2015
Foreign policy likely to dominate next 5 years - whoever is in Downing St. Which person would the UK's enemies prefer to see in Number 10? Mon Apr 06 08:13:13 BST 2015

My view: David Cameron won debate in both substance and style. Clegg coming in 2nd place. Miliband looked nervous and out of place Thu Apr 02 22:02:22 BST 2015
Conservative-led government introduced the Armed Forces Covenant - govt have worked very closely with RBL & Combat Stress to help veterans Thu Apr 02 21:47:30 BST 2015
Bottom line - literally - to tv debate is that NHS and Education can only be delivered with a strong economy. Only Cameron will deliver this Thu Apr 02 21:41:09 BST 2015
Farage playing more to Labour voters than Tory voters. Shows Farage views Miliband as weak. Also, Cameron"s pledge on EU Ref shot UKIP's fox Thu Apr 02 21:36:58 BST 2015
Fact check: Farage was NOT first politician saying UK should take more refugees. It was Mark Pritchard (Dec 2013) followed by Ming Campbell Thu Apr 02 21:19:09 BST 2015
Ed Miliband needs to speak to local Councils & Councillors Labour Councils making the biggest cuts to social care. Cut allowances not care! Thu Apr 02 20:56:04 BST 2015
I didn't think it could be done - but Farage appears to have 'multi-spent' the DFID budget more than Labour have multi-spent the Mansion Tax Thu Apr 02 20:48:39 BST 2015
Farage fails to understand that failed states cost far more in blood and treasure than fragile states - the former also cause mass migration Thu Apr 02 20:34:42 BST 2015
Ed Miliband does not want to talk about the economic past - not surprised! Thu Apr 02 20:26:15 BST 2015
Looks like Nigel Farage is preparing the "turnout" argument as his defence should his party fail to make a breakthrough on 7th May Thu Apr 02 08:27:47 BST 2015

@ChrisBryantMP
The Rhondda Schools Rugby lunch today should be a great occasion for a great initiative.
@kevnkarn1 dear dear dear the same tired old attacks. No parachute here mate. Only local members decide
@Chris_2000 devolution, NHS brought back from brink, LGBT rights, HR Act, Equality Act, Minimum Wage, etc etc
I did a double take when I heard Cameron was to announce new terror laws in the Australian parliament.  Why not here?
I thought Prince Andrew had been sacked as UK envoy?  How come he's at it again?
SO UKIP denied they ever even thought of replacing NHS with privatised insurance model... until the video of Farage calling for it appears!
@danroberts11 i don't disagree with that, but I don't think you can then say we shd be independent
@nr_nicjames when did I say that?
@nr_nicjames Doesn't it just demean politics to say things like that? My loyalty is to the Rhondda.
@math_jones why no?
@WelshGrumpyGit as long as you don't end up looking like a hypocrite.
@Vaughan_Wms You know perfectly well that Labour legislated for the assembly and gave the referendum and argued for yes
@GeorgeapNada to be precise, both of these are managers' not politicians' decisions, but big difficulty is recruitment
@WomanOnTheBoard I take your point about tax dodgers, but Wales gets more than it contributes in tax
@HuwpHuw and supports excluding NHS
@Vaughan_Wms a) we created the Assembly and b) welsh funding increased!
@jowood7138 agreed
There are tough challenges for the NHS in England and Wales, but the only party that really gets it is the one that founded it: Labour
People argue politicians should leave NHS alone - but there is a vast difference between Labour on one hand and UKIP/Tories on the other
It's kind of funny when Plaid Cymru demand independence and a bung from Westminster in the same sentence. @LeanneWood
@Cliff_Buckley I don't think politics is all about seeking votes at every turn
@orwellwinston it means the whole events of Monday need never have happened and she's subverting parliamentary process
I swear to God, if Labour had tried this trick over the European Arrest Warrant the press would have gone into monstering overdrive
@MarcDawson4 yes
@Sam_sportsnews hear bloody hear
Is May contemptuous/terrified of democracy, of the Commons or of her Tory colleagues?
Amazingly, Theresa May will allow the Lords to vote on all 35 JHA measures, including the European Arrest Warrant, though Commons only 11!
@Wadsy_82 @zinegreenzidane Who got a payrise this year?
@Karennotclydach Oh I see, I thought you were having a go at me!
@zinegreenzidane lip service to what?  I have no idea what you are speaking about
@jpieslak you are - I've often spoken up for proper lobbying and PR
@jpieslak that's why i said tawdry first.
An absolutely cracking speech. This is a man who believes in something a man of conviction.  That's what Britain needs, not a tawdry PR man.
@cookie6229 done it today
@FGW having been told my ticket was valid on platform I was untold this when on train. The additional ticket was cheaper than the first!
@ajknight31 @FoDLabour @HaydnBelfield
What is it with Tories? They scorned Clacton & not content with leaving Strood off map they now call it "Benefits Street of the south"!
@FGW bit late I'm afraid. Grrr
@ajknight31 @FoDLabour Hi. Haydn in my office in the Commons
.@IrrancaDaviesMP @BevanJa @MatthewDorrance I'd like to point out that the labour waistcoat tendency started with Huw@
First Great Western's pricing system is so incomprehensible that even the staff at Paddington don't understand it. @FGW
@BenKeiller Thought I’d already done it. I’ll tell the table office today.
@CraigButler1984 @UKIPSwale @p_r_anderson I was quoting Rod Liddle
@Karennotclydach Eh?
@LiamAppleby I’m concerned by all bad polls and excited by all good polls
@thebicycledoc Ok.  I’ll be there for 12 midday if that’s any good?  I’m not doing 12 hours though!
The truth will out: Farage filmed saying he thinks we need "to move to an insurance based system of healthcare" http://t.co/X8FPOr6mKX

@PaulBurston tout court indeed
@KillSocialism no I didn't.  That's a lie.
@JackDannyEsq I'm quoting rod liddle in spectator
@IanLayzell1 @labourpress @YvetteCooperMP @BBCr4today yes it's in
@wheatear9 I think he’s right. Reckless pretends he was always opposed to Lodge Hill, but he spoke in favour of it!
@wheatear9 I’m actually quoting Rod Liddle in the spectator
@Markfergusonuk she’s @naushabahkhan
@GuidoFawkes easy tiger!
BTW those last comments on Mark Reckless were from Rod Liddle not me.
@GuidoFawkes you’re just obsessed with thrashing
@Spitefuel or even convince you!
Mark Reckless: disingenuous, evasive and possessed of all of the charisma and warmth of a caravan site on the Isle of Sheppey in late Feb.
Rod Liddle on R&S hustings: Tory, Kelly Tollhurst, was utterly useless on a rather epic level, unable to string a single sentence together.
http://t.co/rklEy8kLUM Rod Liddle on R&S hustings: Best, by a million miles, was Labour’s @naushabahkhan – unruffled, articulate, competent.
@Spitefuel Well we certainly showed the govt up for ineptitude yesterday
Like Humpty Dumpty the govt seem to think that a motion means precisely what they choose it to mean and not what it plainly means.
Amazed that @BBCr4today had Carswell and Fox and nobody from labour on yesterday's parliamentary fiasco
It's simple. PM promised vote on EAW. He hasn't honoured his word. This Commons farce is Cameron's fault.
The govt has completely lost control of the House.  A shabby shambles.
@made_in_valleys ooh err mrs
@made_in_valleys not sure I'm allowed in Pontyclun!
@JohnRentoul her problem is it all looks like a shabby shambles
@Lesley_London ignore it
I don't think I've ever known such a legislative shambles as today's #nottheEAWdebate
@robfuller91 no I disagree with cash on the EU.  I support it. But I disagree with the process.
@JamesWillby a motion that makes no mention of the European arrest warrant at all.
Just to be clear. Today's debate in the Commons is NOT on the European Arrest Warrant. Real Government jiggery pokery.
After @MarkReckless praise of Gaddafi I said UKIP should resurrect Genghis Khan. A descendant's rung to complain: Khan wouldn't vote UKIP.
Honoured to be at Porth Cenotaph to lay a wreath in the 100th year after the start of WW1 this morning.
One of the good unnoticed changes of the last 20 years. Married women no longer referred to as Mrs David Cameron.
@55krissi55 No. You're just always presuming the worst.
@DrAndrewWatt No. Inspire, lead, persuade, represent.
Nothing makes me despair so much about uk politics as cowards trying to fool the voters with false promises or false boasts. #EUbill
@55krissi55 What's wrong with you? There isn't even first class on the Treherbert line!
Train to Cardiff is filling up. Wales. Wales. Wales.
You won't read this in the Sun. Mr Justice Saunders' sentencing remarks on Ian Edmondson http://t.co/ehmkb14G1K @peterjukes  #hackingtrial
That just about sums it up http://t.co/tcC30u8hg9
I'm amazed BBC swallowed Osborne line on EU Bill.  It's clear as clear can be the rebate wd always apply. Osborne's halved his credibility
Yet more jiggery pokery from govt on Europe.  The motion for Monday which was only tabled today makes no mention of European Arrest Warrant!
Looking forward to the millennium stadium tomorrow 1430
I have to say @HackneyAbbott is on spanking good form on Any Questions.
@IsabelHardman there's no deal - fast unravelling
@rebekah_norton I like it when the lights go up
@rebekah_norton I shall try to be jollier - though it's not even advent yet, let alone christmas! I'm only allowed three jolly days a year
@stevepither @tobycarvery The Lord Tonypandy was lovely thanks.
@RtHonJon it was never 1.7 billion
So basically it was never £1.7 billion in the first place, as the dozy Treasury should have known. And Cameron wants the Labour govt to pay
@rebekah_norton ooh, get you! I must try harder!
@IsabelHardman good one
Four great candidates to ff @naushabahkhan @CPJElmore @Mari_Williams @JoStevensLabour
.@cgi247 Just remind us of @MarkReckless speech on the subject - go on, remind us
@IsabelHardman which is rather more than all the tosh about 2 Labour MPs.
.@IsabelHardman Tories will go disloyal on Monday 10 November and then again on Friday 21 November
The latest irritant from the government - self-congratulatory roundrobin letters from ministers to all MPs.
How odd.  Cameron loses two MPs to UKIP, falls to 27% in polls, has threat of 100 MP revolt on European Arrest - and that's not newsworthy
A bit of good news in Porth
http://t.co/SoIvXIHDp1
Pretty shabby that @MarkReckless hasn't turned up for the Churches' hustings. I thought this was meant to be open politics?
Sorry not to be at #StonewallAwards (though I don't think I was invited). Good luck to contenders!
@tomwilson23 I haven't made a speech today

@BBCPolitics he's not chief whip!
@ryanthomas2013 a bigger threat than what?
.@PaulGoodmanCH @douglascarswell The Tories don't have a good record on sitting with mad, bad and dangerous MEPs either!
@mredfellow indeed
So @MarkReckless don't treat the voters like fools.  Own up.  You supported Lodge Hill, bedroom tax and Cameron's NHS privatisation. End of.
.@MarkReckless You also urged a review of Natural England's decision on Lodge Hill and wanted the Council to be able to go ahead
.@MarkReckless So the truth is, you backed the Lodge Hill development.
.@MarkReckless You said key comparison was between '84 nightingales and homes for 12,000 people and jobs for a further 5,000 people'
.@MarkReckless You called Lodge Hill 'a shovel ready project that wd deliver 5,000 much needed homes being delayed by a government agency'
.@MarkReckless Explain this speech then.... http://t.co/Y6pGaBL8hu
.@cgi247 Why did @MarkReckless support it last year?

It's ironic really. Cameron fed his euro-phobic backbenchers with titbits and now they want to eat him whole.
"@thhamilton: @ChrisBryantMP "Say what you like about Gaddafi, he stopped the boats running on time."" @MarkReckless

The most revealing element of today's #pmqs was Cameron twice refusing to rule out raising VAT after #GE2015
Cameron talking about his inheritance. ....
I'm proud of @Ed_Miliband for leading on UK membership of the EU at #PMQs. He's right, our economy/national standing wd suffer if we left.
So it turns out the @MailOnline story on @fawcettsociety feminist T-shirt was untrue. What a surprise. Welcome to #GE2015
Cameron's Europe policy is confused, wrong-headed and utterly unconvincing.  Brexit by mistake/default would irreparably damage UK
@Stephenh61 boom boom
Is it true?  Did @GregHands really think it right to put posters up in Chatham graveyard?
The Tories have put posters up for their candidate in Chatham graveyard, showing themselves to be the poor taste party again.
@NadineDorriesMP @GuidoFawkes fair point except in this case @JohnMannMP has long campaigned v anti-semitism and this is one instance
@The_Iron_Lad I don't think you understand what apostrophes are for
@jimmythefool @guidofawkes @johnmannmp No, I don't think so.
@GuidoFawkes @nadinedorriesmp It's worth debating I think. There's abuse and threats.
@GuidoFawkes @johnmannmp It's about anti-Semitic attacks as per his point of order last week.
@nthurlbeck I disagree. Some people actually think anti-semitism is acceptable. Hence the attacks, including on MPs who happen to be Jewish
@IsabelHardman @MrHarryCole @waynesmith1971 you mean envious
18. That's the number of times @MarkReckless has voted for Cameron's fragmentation and privatisation of the NHS. #notanothersecondchance
@DoctorChristian Hi. Could you follow me for a DM please?
@Sam_Peepz @ZacGoldsmith when there is a division the vote of each member is recorded and published in Hansard

@Sam_Peepz @ZacGoldsmith it's a recorded vote
@Sam_Peepz @ZacGoldsmith for
My deepest sadness is that the people hot hardest by this govt are those who often vote the least. A cynical irony.
@markhughes I'm speaking for myself. Money has never affected a single vote I've cast.
@IrkHudson I don't see it that way. No domestic government would have forced telecoms companies to slash roaming charges. Commission did.
The fact that the EU achieves anything at all, given the political imperative of appeasing short-term domestic politics, is a miracle.
@smalltown2k yep. A point I've made before.  No party has excelled. We must change that.
@DavidAllenGreen @JackofKent exchange is over
New home approvals fall by 11%.  Housing is the country’s crying need and the government’s major failing.
@markhughes @JackofKent Your tweet was disrespectful. Big money makes absolutely no difference to how I vote as an MP. At all.
@ben4ipswich @antonylittle I’m clearly completely lost!
I despair.  David Davis interview on @BBCr4today showed that many UK politicians have absolutely no idea how the EU works.
@markhughes @JackofKent What silly nonsense.  There’s money and partyism in the Lords too.
@antonylittle @ben4ipswich I said it wouldn’t become law that year.  It didn’t.
Seems all that guff earlier this week from @NickyMorgan01 was just cynical posturing not a real change of heart at all.
Seems @NickyMorgan01 is all over the place on LGBT. For, against, for, against. Precisely the kind of shilly-shally politics people hate.
@MargaretRHallid @LabourEoin They already are and yet rely on a state subsidy
Si la izquierda pudiera unirse, todo seria posible. En España,  en el Reino Unido y en Europa.
@malcpowers not all of tgem
Interesting that the poll in Spain that puts Podemos ahead has PSOE second and a total of 60% for three left parties.
What joy. Standing only yet again. In one month 6 cancelled trains, five more than 30 minutes late and 5 standing only.
@botzarelli @alanbillingspcc @bbcnews Public service broadcasting should announce all key election results
@LabourEoin it's a nonsense that perverts our democracy
@markhughes I disagree. It's just one of many targets, but an important one.
Delighted Sol Campbell wants to get involved in politics. Just sad that he wants to bypass democracy and sit in the Lords. #notforreal
What a surprise. If UKIP had won yesterday it would have been front page. @AlanBillingsPCC victory is p8, p14, p18 and not on @BBCNews at 10
@RevRichardColes yet
@bmc875 but in this by-election the main opposition was UKIP
.@bmc875 I see the Tories, UKIP, Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid as the opposition, in no particular order!
Sorry to hear @MatthewdAncona is departing the @Telegraph. He writes well and has often infuriated me into action....
I am really delighted @AlanBillingsPCC has won the PCC election. He taught at my old theological college. Only Labour can beat UKIP.
Tory campaign in #RochesterandStrood is in a right old pickle. @TelePolitics says it can't find a single tory mp who thinks they can win
@55krissi55 I agree
The sad thing is David Coburn is gay. Clearly doesn't like himself very much.
David Coburn, UKIP MEP, crafted his words to be as deliberately offensive as possible equating gays with nazis and calling them queens.

@VeryBritishDude That's far too complicated for me. I would rather see a labour victory.
@VeryBritishDude ha ha. Don't waste your time.
@VeryBritishDude I'm entirely partisan, but the Tory campaign is in disarray.

@silverstrivers I don't think you've read the original story accurately. It was never publicly available.
@silverstrivers I didn't.
@silverstrivers nor did I.
@silverstrivers you've mentioned it so often now I can only presume you're a little obsessed
@TerenceMcleod but he did reply. He nodded.

@alstewitn @IainDale It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve disagreed with either of them
@PrinceOfSalerno @IainDale Ho ho ho. Not even Iain supports Fallon on this one.
@IainDale I think it does.  We disagree (plus ca change).
@IainDale Do you think his ‘swamping’ reference was suitable?
@IainDale It really is - apart from his utter devotion to Party duty.
Spain, before the European Arrest Warrant was the ‘costa del crimen’. That’s what UKIP and Tory ultras want to turn UK into.
It’s amazing really that Fallon is the SoS for Defence.
Fallon is doubly irresponsible, saying Tory plans will end ‘swamping’ of communities by migrants, yet hasn’t even seen plans.

@gazengland73 Cheers. We're all allowed mistakes.
@gazengland73 incidentally I have never treated Rhondda as safe. Labour lost it in 1999
@gazengland73 No parachute.  Local Rhondda members chose me out of 52. I never voted Tory but I was a member. Saw error of my ways in 1981
The emergency provision for possible suspension of free movement in EU is intended for earthquakes, not PM losing an MP and by-election
Jeremy Hunt forgets that every other country has a veto on any treaty change.
Jeremy Hunt repeats lie that government has cut net migration by a quarter.  It's exactly what it was in 2010. Stop the false promises.
Andrew Rawnsley once wrote that the first party to lose the plot would lose the election.  Cameron's barn-pot EU-panic shows he's lost it.
Great concert start....

@sazzy69 No, not seen it.
@AlDarkSkyWales good to hear
Just a thought - the whole point of a Freudian slip is that it reveals what you were really thinking.
Government seems to have a new EU policy every day. That's what comes of chasing your own ukip tail rather than national interest.
Amazing. Tory MP @JackieDP backs Lord Freud who said disabled people should be paid £2 an hour http://t.co/VJldYJUQHR
@cranfieldadams No. Just turn up
@williamdbates @cllrtrisosborne @naushabahkhan nonsense. We had large numbers out this week
@reporterboy @rowland_jamie @IainDale Ah. Impressions!  If only the reality were as we all believe it to be!
@Welshracer @reporterboy @IainDale It's numerically true
@reporterboy @chalimangp @Ford_Tippex @IainDale You could say that the most clearly imposed candidates have been Carswell and Reckless
@rowland_jamie @reporterboy @IainDale It's pretty straightforward.  Nominations, short list, selection hustings all local.
@Welshracer @reporterboy @IainDale all parties are finding it more difficult to get candidates these days
@sloz91 @HopeRhondda could you email me?
@DJSkelton @IainDale I'm open to that but difficult to police
@cranfieldadams end of the day on Monday
@Welshracer @reporterboy @IainDale Who pays? Legally enforced postal primaries cost at least £100,000 each per party.
@Ford_Tippex @reporterboy @IainDale Not true. Local members vote on the short list
@IainDale @reporterboy no. I wasn't.  I was approved by NEC afterwards
@sloz91 Hi. Sounds great.  What's it all about? @HopeRhondda
.@IainDale we're doing the London mayoral election that way. Trouble is the cost. Tories spent £50000 already?
.@reporterboy In my case local members chose me from 51 other candidates. No national involvement at all  @IainDale
.@reporterboy I've always objected to use of "parachuted" except where the whole choice is made by national party eg kate hoey @IainDale
.@reporterboy How so? Local Labour members choose candidates for council assembly and parliamentary elections.  @IainDale
.@IainDale quite. My point is made. We have a great candidate in @naushabahkhan You don't have one.
.@IainDale Lol Tell us another one do. Cameron hit the panic button. Voters only allowed choice of party approved candidates @naushabahkhan
.@IainDale that's not what they've said to me. More feel betrayed by Cameron
.@IainDale No. The Tories don't even have a candidate!  @naushabahkhan
.@IainDale and so far I've seen no sign of a Tory campaign. Tory MPs refusing to go.
.@IainDale far from it. We were campaigning long before the bye-election was called and have best candidate by far in @naushabahkhan
So far the Tory campaign in #RochesterandStrood has consisted of a v expensive direct mail letter delivered by Royal Mail.
How v ironic. Tory potential candidate @anna_firth attacks UKIP because it would give tax cuts to millionaires! Ahem #RochesterandStrood
Utter drivel on @BBCr4today about clichés in politics. Frankly, the whole discussion is clichéd. Most language is a quotation.
I've written a review of the fabulous #FathomlessRiches by @revrichardcoles http://t.co/StqKDUdEgG
@UnbiasedF hurrah!
@snazzymcsnazz I think he means much much wealthier than that. Vast majority of inheritances already excluded
"@BBCJLandale: Iain Duncan Smith leaves PMQs early. I wonder what has come up?"
Just a thought. Cameron says only the very wealthy should pay inheritance tax. Does that include him?
Tory MPs banging on about Europe.
Tory welfare reform minister Ld Freud says disabled people "not worth the full wage" and shd consider £2/hour.  RT if you think he shd go
Hi @PeterBazalgette can I pick your brains?
Btw Gabriel Wikström is a Social Democrat.
This is the new Swedish health minister, Gabriel Wikström. http://t.co/EV3k4IYne8
@foodleedskidstv @_James_Lyons_ @jameskirkup That's the 20 I know of personally.  Ashcroft polling suggests four times that many
@_James_Lyons_ @jameskirkup Ashcroft of course has listed a fair few with polling support
@_James_Lyons_ @jameskirkup XXX
@nthurlbeck An Inspector Calls always a great definition of socialism.  Time and the Conways more melancholic
@jameskirkup there’s a great deal of churning, but next time I see you I’ll list twenty seats I am certain will go Con-Lab
@RevRichardColes once you get over the headlines
@hocwatch @jameskirkup @edballsmp No, he’s not.
@nthurlbeck @raleighbanana JB Priestley - a great lefty
@jameskirkup I disagree.  I can list a swathe of Tory seats that will fall to Labour, none the other way round
@rODIUMrECORDS I hope you’re enjoying it - guess so, if you’ve already bought vol 2!
@Tetburyboy you're blocked.
@Sam_Peepz I'm in Rochester now!
@jackthorpebaker near the castle
I can confirm that Rochester has a very beautiful Cathedral.
You'd be hard pressed to know that Mr Reckless is the UKIP candidate from his leaflets.
@HenrySmithMP at least we agree there
@Wyrdtimes England and the rest of the UK has had two referendums
@alextalbot116 agreed
.@AlanDuncanMP Alan it was a very good speech.
.@RevRichardColes except I bet you have more than one kind of dog collar shirt.
@HenrySmithMP @HouseofTwits what about Scottish peers?
Tories seem to have just 2 potential candidates for the "safe seat" of Rochester and Strood.  Tories already voting with their feet.
It strikes me that the present government either has no foreign policy or has had it overturned by Commons on Magnitsky,  Syria, ME peace
@davidkerri Right, you’re blocked - for being tedious
Some people have questioned my voting, so, to be clear, I voted last night to recognise Palestinian State.  No two state solution otherwise
I'd forgotten about this....Thanks to @JPGSheedy for reminding me what Hammond is like http://t.co/zWRDQRkIRe
@lfpme @DanielPJMaguire yes
@DanielPJMaguire yes I am. Already tweeted I'm voting for recognition
@thistle8blower I am. Already tweeted I shall be voting for recognition
@FeelTheCritique @tomcopley they're not accountable at all!
@dp_nicholas point remains
Very irritating that they keep on announcing the jubilee line train will not stop at the next station, which can't by definition be true.
"@MjlwalkerMark: .@ChrisBryantMP .Chris would mind RT this. Good luck to Wales tonight in the football against Cyprus. Come on Wales!"
Why if EVEL were to bar Scots MPs shd Scots peers 9th Earl of Arran, 14th E of Stair, 16th E of Lindsay & Ld Smith be allowed to vote?
Not sure when my review of @RevRichardColes autobiography will appear in @guardian but launch party is tomorrow
@Welshracer @Doctorwhizz cheers
Slightly surprised that there are so few Conservative and Unionist MPs present for the statement on Scotland within the UK
@Doctorwhizz I hope you enjoy them when they arrive!
@mirabarhillel yes
Just to be clear, as people keep on asking,I shall be voting for the motion to recognise the Palestinian state
I shall be voting tomorrow for recognition of Palestinian statehood because I support the two state solution and a secure state of Israel.
@toryofold @HouseofTwits or not
I reckon @YvetteCooperMP has got it right in the @Independent on immigration concerns and taking on #UKIP http://t.co/5N3C6Iv7rQ
@MPritchardMP so when is the time?
@patrickwintour @DenisMacShane No. Entirely against Treaty of Rome
.@marcusaroberts @LordAshcroft You leave out the effect a poll can have in enabling "tactical" voting and the squeeze factor
@EsylltMair it's never been quite as monolithic as you suggest, but without that Welsh labour bloc we'd never have had the NHS
Isn't the very concept of a party's "heartland" deeply obnoxious?  It just patronises voters and pretends they somehow belong to a party.
@ajknight31 @FoDLabour sure. If we can find a date.
Yet another train late and another cancelled.  I blame Mrs Thatcher.
@MrMattvR @UKParliament I really enjoyed it!
Sorry all, enjoyed the HIV+ ban debate but I have to go now. Hasta luego.
@CromwellRandall @GuidoFawkes What treatment?
@jt_tasker @GuidoFawkes No - most use their E111 form in EU
@FoxHedgehog @GuidoFawkes Not true of HIV.
@CromwellRandall @GuidoFawkes we shouldn't be.  But we shouldn't bar entry to a visitor with HIV
@nicholasmelt1 It's always been charge EU patients' countries (and others)
@FoxHedgehog @GuidoFawkes risks to UK or non-treatment?  Take me through that...
@WotOBunty @GuidoFawkes defend what?
@jt_tasker @GuidoFawkes We have an exchange arrangement with all EU countries.  2 million Brits abroad
@RichardWS @GuidoFawkes Ha ha ha (three words)
@GuidoFawkes Right - off for a swim in Bronwydd and then to Bridgend CLP
@Cumpedelibero @cityhammer @GuidoFawkes So it seems.
@steve_aatw @GuidoFawkes Good point
@GuidoFawkes I only had one hour's sleep last night ! and a moving funeral this afternoon.
@GuidoFawkes I said No earlier actually.
@GuidoFawkes No
@GuidoFawkes Cool.  We agree then.  I must have missed that answer.
@redskinsfanuk @GuidoFawkes and EU ones' countries are meant to be charged back
@GuidoFawkes If you answer a question I'll answer yours
@nicholasmelt1 I'm not saying we should allow people to use the NHS free of charge
@GuidoFawkes Farage has.  That's his policy. That's what we're debating
@GuidoFawkes Do you think it practicable or moral to bar HIV+ people from UK?
@GuidoFawkes No.
@davidjacksmith Right, you're blocked for swearing
@nicholasmelt1 No.  I'm not saying people should have free access to our NHS.  But Farage wants to bar HIV+ people from UK.
@James_monk1 I'm attacking a moron? I'm lost now!
@davidkerri @GuidoFawkes How do you police this policy? Do you understand anything about HIV infection?
@adamoicu @GuidoFawkes Nobody is advocating free care.  Farage wants to bar HIV+ people from entry to UK
@seti2342 @GuidoFawkes You referred to lepers.
@GuidoFawkes So I ask again, how can this policy possibly work?  I agree it's a national health service.  But barring HIV+ from entry?
@James_monk1 I don't think it's arrogance to hold a clear, sincerely held view. Is it?
@James_monk1 How do you run this policy?  Test everyone at the border and agin six weeks later? Returning UK nationals too?
@foxtrotoscar007 @GuidoFawkes which is why nobody does
@nicholasmelt1 There is no ban in the US - but there is in Putin's Russia
@seti2342 @GuidoFawkes HIV is not leprosy
.@cityhammer @GuidoFawkes HIV is not a death sentence
@GuidoFawkes Is it practicable to test everyone at the border?  Do you know anything about HIV?
Really sad but magnificent funeral this afternoon for Margaret Phillips, one of the Rhondda Labour's best. I cried.
UKIP excuses, what Farage 'really meant' is weasel politicianspeak.  He wants to bar HIV+ people from UK. It's impracticable and immoral.
@JonAshworth @GloriaDePieroMP @naushabahkhan I'll be there..
@natachakennedy @theJeremyVine ha ha
@marky_markinson @stellacreasy how do you check?
Sadly @theJeremyVine asked for me and then stood me down in favour of ukip and Tories
@Mauginog @MagsNews @labour52rose all of the above I'd say
@DAaronovitch did you talk to any voters in Clacton?
The nastiest element of Farage comment on HIV+ is questioning people's "quality"
@DAaronovitch or let us suppose they both show the same collapse of Tory vote. Or let's not suppose at all.
.@Charles90 @steve_hawkes @FGW I'm going to a funeral!.
@tbjandrew @georgeeaton which point?
@Charles90 @steve_hawkes @FGW I'm going to a funeral
@SamLeach6 biggest thing is tackle low pay
@SamLeach6 I suspect that having listened to hundreds in Clacton I may have a half decent idea what they think
@SamLeach6 you honestly think rejecting ttip would be popular with working class communities?
@SamLeach6 what would you do differently
@AndyMcCrimmon @rclarke guardian and others
@mattholehouse it was the Tories ' 86th safest seat. Since the boundary change taking out Harwich. Did you visit Frinton?
@SamLeach6 it?
@Charles90 @steve_hawkes @FGW I was on the 540 from Clacton!
@mattholehouse No. Most of the constituency is classic Tory area.
@mattholehouse and street lights...
@mattholehouse classic squeeze, early poll, labour have just 4/43 cllrs, Tory MP joined ukip
So @FGW you've cancelled the 815 to cardiff.  Not sure I'll make the funeral now.
@derekchapman1 @labourpress @IsabelHardman @SuttonCardiff probably right. Hurrah
@guylavis a good point
@rubeusflint how would you spot who is HIV?
@IsabelHardman @SuttonCardiff Only because you didn't spot the collapse in Tory and LD vote in H&M and now have to mask your surprise
Farage and 20 Conservative MPs ape Putin's Russia in wanting to bar HIV+ people entry at the border. #nohumanity
Hi @FGW are there problems with the Paddington to Cardiff trains?
@MoodySlayerUK probably.  Don't know how else to put it!
@MjlwalkerMark how so?
@Dukevfr @ArrivaTW cos it's FGW?
@afroswede it was a good night for UKIP,  a devastating one for the Tories and a very tough but successful one for us
Are there problems with Paddington trains to Cardiff?
@ElaineK1804 ha!
@FredChukkawakka nobody's denying the threat.  But the nature of it needs sane analysis.
I've realised something weird.  Some political people are normally up at this hour!
Of course Labour has things to learn but the massive Tory swing to UKIP is the seismic element here.
Journos hate to be surprised so are now hyperbolic. The big long term story of 10.10.2014 is collapse of Tory vote, loss of MP and seat.
.@IsabelHardman I think journos overreact when they are surprised.  The bigger longterm story is collapse of Tory vote and loss of seat.
I'm at Bridgend CLP tonight talking about Parliament, the Biography and raising some cash for #GE2015
@KarlTurnerMP I do need sleep. I know, I am weak
@JohannaBaxter no! I love sleep!
@IsabelHardman @NigelNelson Cameron has seen his vote collapse in 2 seats and he's lost an mp.
@IsabelHardman except it isn't stuffed with core vote, is it? We increased our share, Con and LD collapsed to UKIP
@mattholehouse @HouseofTwits Wrong. The Clacton constituency was the Tories' 86th safest!
After 82 minutes sleep I'm on the 540 from Clacton home to the Rhondda for much-missed loyal labourite Margaret Philips' funeral RIP
@sundersays it's accurate though
@Scribbles123 I'm sorry you feel that. I was asked on to talk about Clacton
@RoehamptonAdam so you're inciting people to violence?
@permakill rather different
I shall be voting to recognise Palestinian state to further two state solution in the Commons on Monday.
@jameskirkup wrong on several counts
I fear a national eruption of hyperbole and hyperventilating as journalists brush off their lexicon of exaggeration.

@SimonCa45650996 @BracknellLibDms Well done on your local community work. Question was actually directed at local Lib Dems Wed Mar 04 17:28:01 GMT 2015
@BracknellLibDms @SimonCa45650996 50 hours minimum per week as an MP 4 hours per week on average as a GP. What do you do in your spare time? Wed Mar 04 16:59:18 GMT 2015

@SimonCa45650996 I hope you appreciated reading the pamphlet which was paid for and delivered by volunteers. All the figures are accurate Wed Mar 04 16:54:45 GMT 2015
@BracknellLibDms @SimonCa45650996 @vincecable costs relate to constituency work not ministerial. Thank you for highlighting Lib Dem waste Wed Mar 04 16:53:41 GMT 2015
@SimonCa45650996 I'm in the lowest quartile on cost. Suggest you now delete your tweet as it unjustifiably questioned my values & integrity Wed Mar 04 16:51:38 GMT 2015

"Acquisition of knowledge entails a responsibility for the integrity of what we are as ethical creatures" A good read http://t.co/QPHbgFTuTT
@ProfJAnderson each individual has responsibility to show viral status prior to coming to UK so that appropriate management is undertaken
@ProfJAnderson no mention of travel ban in amendment. Indeed, no mention of action to be taken on receipt of viral status information
@NAT_AIDS_Trust @THTorguk For you both to read and reflect upon before our meeting tomorrow http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@BritishHIVAssoc I was approached specifically about migrant Hep B. It'd have been wrong to have included just one blood-borne virus surely?
@OutbreakJake ...I'm not expecting one
@bengoldacre glad you are in favour of gathering data as this is what's required to fight global viral spread http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@HanBridgestock @bengoldacre wouldn't have a problem with that. As my articles states eradication of blood-borne viruses should be our goal
@bengoldacre and this http://t.co/TwHWerJItw. Talk about bad science
@bengoldacre clearly I'm not. Also about UK public health. Just read this http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@bengoldacre just so I understand. Are you disagreeing with my article's content?
@bengoldacre or would you rather not know? Personally I'd be v happy to be tested if I was applying for perm residence in another country
@bengoldacre better than someone knows their viral status, surely?
@bengoldacre amendment was about responsibility for determining viral status. No reference made to any subsequent action
@RupertMyers No. My amendment to Immigration Bill didn't mention a travel ban. It was about http://t.co/IfkStT3Xsi. Based on fact not fear
@bengoldacre My amendment didn't call for a ban on people coming to UK because of positive viral status. It was about http://t.co/IfkStT3Xsi
@mattholehouse there was no mention of banning entry to anyone in my amendment. Yr report & others misrepresented my position and intentions
@mattholehouse I think eradicating pathogens is a good idea. To do so, you need to know where they are...
@JosephFitchett it would have been discriminatory to have only included one blood-borne virus in amendment. Agree about immunisation prog
@mattholehouse probing amendment was about ascertaining viral status not about management thereafter. Article about why I placed amendment
@ben4bath you should read this and then comment about the reasoning behind my amendment to the Immigration bill http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@JosephFitchett It is about protecting public health http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@mattholehouse not about banning anyone. Get your facts straight. Amendment was about protecting us all http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@AndrewBoff @margotjamesmp the reasoning behind my amendment http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@Pkakooza this should help you understand my position http://t.co/5y6gnk33Ih
@amazingexpress @gaystarnews amendment not discriminatory. The reverse. HIV should be treated as any other blood-borne virus in these circs
@silv24 reason for my amendment mainly stemmed from this in the Lancet http://t.co/TwHWerJItw
@silv24 I was advised by senior hepatologist v worried about migrant Hep B. I judged it discriminatory to not add other blood-borne viruses
@AndrewCooper__ @Positive_lee @CllrRWillis no it is not. Happy to meet to discuss further. Limited Twitter exchange not appropriate
@BenCooper86 @drwollastonmp Yes I would, as for any patient if clinically indicated. Are you medically qualified to comment?
@Positive_lee @CllrRWillis @AndrewCooper__ same point applies. Knowing status helps care management for LTNPs and other HIV+ people
@CllrRWillis @Positive_lee @AndrewCooper__ you need to know your HIV status to make that decision
@AndrewCooper__ no. Amendment doesn't stipulate what action to take. Decision should be driven by public health interest
@Positive_lee @CllrRWillis @AndrewCooper__ yes. To clarify: no entry until full treatment of Hep B. For HIV entry once medication started
@CllrRWillis @AndrewCooper__ wording is clear. Blood-borne viruses are a threat to us all. Treatment requires knowledge of their existence
@ChrisBryantMP I can see the problem. E.g. Around 6500 cases of chronic Hep B infection entering the UK each year http://t.co/TwHWerJItw
@ChrisBryantMP yes if I were applying to take residence. Any country needs to know what it is dealing with
@AndrewCooper__ not a ban. About having knowledge so that we can manage public health risks associated
@AndrewVdL yes
@WelshGasDoc As a physician my first responsibility is to my patient. How can I help them with treatment if I don't know their viral status?
@DavidRCJReader my amendment isn't about banning anyone. It's about detecting blood-borne virus carriage. After detection can come treatment
@mctigues try reading the amendment. Not about banning migrants. About appropriate treatment and public health
@ChrisBryantMP my amendment doesn't ban migrants. If someone knows their HIV/HepB status are they not more likely to behave responsibly?
@archangelolill good overview here from two eminent UK hepatologists http://t.co/TwHWerJItw
@benclavey read the amendment. 2(c) describes 'other pathogens'
@KCQCMP @margotjamesmp @drwollastonmp agree
@margotjamesmp @drwollastonmp nonsense. It is about public health. We need to pull together on this
@NAT_AIDS_Trust knowing who carries blood-borne viruses will help their treatment & eradication. Hence public health more protected. Simple
@TechnicalVault no. Individuals who know they're HIV+ understand risk of transmission. Those who don't do not
@benclavey HIV and Hep B (and others) are both blood-borne viruses and therefore should be treated as such
"@thameswater: @DrPhillipLeeMP Hi, we will get this looked into." < Urgently please
@thameswater Almost two weeks ago I sent a letter to your Chief Executive regarding a constituent of mine. When will I get a response?
@archangelolill stopping Hep B positive migrants from entering the UK. Virus levels are increasing and migration patterns are relevant
@DannyKushlick Yes. UK policy should be about mitigating serious public health risk. Better that we help fund global vaccination programme
@DannyKushlick Of course area is a difficult one. Vulnerable groups in this country would benefit from lowering viral carriage in UK
@DannyKushlick It's appropriate and now necessary to ascertain disease status. NHS funding burden for hepatic medicine demand not tenable
@ACPCarnegie TB already sorted in May 2012. Now part of immigration screening process. Why not Hep B?
There are an estimated 6500 new cases of chronic Hepatitis B infection entering the UK each year. This is an avoidable public health crisis
My Immigration Bill amendment on Hep B & other relevant pathogens here http://t.co/Olk2gRPAnc (NC21) Increased Hep B rates must be addressed

@Bracknell_UKIP  Not "my theory". Future will be more community-based chronic care & fewer specialist acute care hubs http://t.co/vTWKTJAg5R
@Bracknell_UKIP @Hugh_Fort Because needs to be regional hub hospital serving >700,000. Hence should be on M4 somewhere btwn Reading & Slough

Appropriate response to CQC report on #Wexham Park should take long-term view. Acute care best delivered in regional specialist hub hospital
@digWinstanley Difficult to be accurate about construction time.This http://t.co/OgQdnOpCkO suggests by the end of decade would be realistic
CQC on #Wexham: "lack of engagement & cooperation amongst trust managers & staff posed risk that...could result in substandard care..."
CQC: "concerns about leadership & management of maternity service" at #Wexham. Nine 'serious untoward incidents' btwn June 8 & July 25 2013
CQC on #Wexham: "difficult to attract & retain staff (due to) location...& reputation of hospital" New specialist hub on M4 would solve this
CQC on #Wexham: "not enough qualified, skilled @ experienced staff to meet people's needs". Easier to better staff new regional hub hospital
@CunningtoP Agree. PFI involvement in healthcare not had a good track record. Enough valuable assets locally to fund new regional hospital
CQC: "Patients were not always protected from risks of providing treatment & care due to out of date, broken faulty or unsuitable equipment"
CQC on #Wexham: "poor physical condition of some of...medical wards...meant that many areas could not be properly cleaned" New buildings req
CQC on #Wexham Park: "overall hospital estate..in need of significant & urgent maintenance & redecoration" New hospital is a better solution

@NormanBallentin Inc global energy demand + rising nationalism. Unstable autocratic control of maj of energy resource hence security problem
@MarkReckless Agree. Challenge is 2 use competition 2 keep energy prices low whilst guaranteeing supply 'Brownouts' already likely from 2016
@MarkReckless Russian gas supply does affect global prices. LNG ships are inc turning left out of Hormuz. We've a lot to thank Norway for
@MarkReckless Party loyalty has a price sometimes! Strongly believe that in inc unstable world UK needs energy policy that delivers security
@MarkReckless global energy market is not a true 'free' market. Evidence: OPEC, Russian faux imperialism based on energy. Ask Georgians...
@MarkReckless maybe for want replace prefer. If you are correct why are we having to introduce a capacity market?

@tompainespirit @AndyCavster Yes. Unfortunately not likely 2 be 'game changer' IMHO. Energy efficiency, gas & nuclear would be my priorities
@Mike_Loudmouth @AndyCavster You've misunderstood. In Hansard read my contributions on DECC sel ctte over last 3 yrs. Cited market failings
@maxpark1 @AndyCavster Not neocon. Improving UK energy independence would make involvement in Middle East less likely to be due to oil price
@tompainespirit @AndyCavster medical doctor with an interest in energy policy
@AndyCavster Government control of commodity prices is always a bad idea. Market always wins. Better to concentrate on security of supply
Energy policy should drive foreign policy which should drive defence policy. Energy = GDP. Strategic approach required to protect UK economy
UK gov energy policy should be about security first. Markets want scarcity to maintain prices. Hence market will not deliver energy security
Lab partially right about energy market failing. Price fixing out-dated medicine, though. Inc competition needed & some State £ for security

@digWinstanley @fionamacmp @AdamAfriyie Yes. Against @RBWM decision 4 judicial review of plan Relocation of services consistent with my plan
@digWinstanley @fionamacmp @AdamAfriyie My position remains same. Inc. demand 4 healthcare & inc. specialisation = need for reconfiguration
@JarlathOBrien Yes. Please contact my office phillip@phillip-lee.com

@BracknellLibDms Supply will never meet demand. Emerg cover requires central planning. For what u describe try visiting US & observe reality
@RogerBlack3 suspect not!
About to be on Simon Mayo's show on @BBCRadio2 to discuss the ECC select ctte report on #energyprices @ofgem
@Abarth50010 Agree. That would be a good place to start
@at192 @Bobski_OFFICIAL Neither haughty nor dismissive. My GP income always declared in public domain. Hence no need 2 ask original question
@at192 @Bobski_OFFICIAL Yes. And your point is what? I'm a freelance GP. I have no shares in any GP business or partnership
@at192 Not odd. Unsurprisingly my reputation matters 2 me. Up to u 2 b sure of yr legal ground before linking 2 sites that imply impropriety
@at192 @Bobski_OFFICIAL My work with Medical Solutions Ltd solely involved telephone patient advice work
 To suggest otherwise is actionable
@LeeMorgan239 From hundreds of doorstep meetings in #Bracknell constituency, quarterly public meetings & correspondence. Pretty good cohort
Good article: IDS in Guardian today http://t.co/XaM5fl9x1g Responsible & timely welfare reform that in my experience has wide public support

Today's ECC Select committee report on energy prices http://t.co/BqlrisAkud (for some reason last link was broken...)
My select committee has released a report on energy prices today http://t.co/R81ph8hQTd More transparency from 'The Big Six' required
@Abarth50010 We need 2 accept reality of #NHS funding challenge if we r 2 protect principle of access to care at time of clinical need 4 all
@Abarth50010 I understand. However NHS funding cannot continue 2 inc forever. What about funding 4 education, defence, police? All essential
@Abarth50010 both T1 & T2 DM have genetic component Universally accepted that lifestyle choice affects T2 incidence. View video of my speech
@s_d_c U r right to ask me to explain. U r not right to call me untrustworthy. Lazy cynicism about politicians will get our country nowhere
@Bobski_OFFICIAL No. Check my register of interests before asking lazy questions
@s_d_c no I didn't. Watch the video before making such assertions
@FairytaleFood Saw what exactly? The Telegraph article or the original speech and answer session? I've just tweeted the link to the video
@s_d_c @FairytaleFood Link to original speech video http://t.co/A4dLghdC8j (I start at 12'50") Rising costs of NHS unsustainable. Any ideas?
@s_d_c To state that I'm untrustworthy has no foundation whatsoever. Indeed, it could be argued that I've been brave & honest in my comments
@FairytaleFood I'm determined to protect access to healthcare for all in the longer term by honestly debating the challenges facing the #NHS
@FairytaleFood Also with DM inc over last 10yrs primarily due 2 lifestyle & projected NHS costs of 25% its budget by 2025 what do u suggest?
@FairytaleFood pls check what I did say, the context in which my speech was made & subsequent tweets before drawing such unfair conclusions
Interesting article by @MorrisseyHelena in Sunday Tel http://t.co/YOwSWJTipX Opinions are worth noting when based upon first-hand experience
Timely and realistic article by @kwasikwarteng http://t.co/twsDRLbscZ Well worth a read
@s_d_c @christopherhope Maj of inc in DM over last 10 yrs due to lifestyle choice. Projection: 25% of NHS budget by 2025 will be spent on DM
@s_d_c Speech was made in context of untenable inc. trend in public spend. x2 NHS budget in last 10 yrs still not enough. What do u suggest?
@s_d_c Obviously I was referring to Type 2 DM
@BracknellLibDms Tough call. Decision based upon QALY. If all NHS care was subjected to the same analysis, would all services be continued?

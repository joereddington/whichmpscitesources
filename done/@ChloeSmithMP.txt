Great from @NewAngliaLEP. I've signed up to the campaign, will you join me in calling for better rail services in East Anglia?
@Conservatives can only offer improvements to NHS because we've taken hard choices to get public spending under control & stop waste
@Conservatives 7 day GP access & funding for more GPs will help #Norwich patients. Norwich GPs apply to 2nd Access Fund to make it happen
@BigG0dfrey @andrewpolitics @MsVictoria2 @ben4ipswich 2/2 We're honest on it:improving our rail takes time. Decades E Anglia underinvestment

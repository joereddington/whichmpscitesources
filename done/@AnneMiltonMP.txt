@sharpeleven knew what I had done - rested it and now rehabilitating it with exercise. Hoping the NHS will be saved from having to operate!
Knee recovering - exercise cures all! Now much more mobile on the bike and a generally less hazardous feel to it.
But oh yes - victory on the standing/leaning position hunt - by the bike racks near the loo - smelly but roomy.
1st decision of the day is whether to grab one of the best standing/leaning positions or whether to continue hopefully looking for a seat..?
7.17 with 10 coaches - hmmm - but enough coaches for a seat remains to be seen!

@CEOLearningLink my pleasure! Great to see such good work.
Favourite author this week - John Lanchester (read Debt to Pleasure years ago). Reading Capital - need more time to do so however!
@DianaMRoberts it's cold! Recommend cardboard canoe over head and feet - easy to construct and works well!
@gulfaprilia it is usually warmer but rain makes hair management a challenge!
@citycyclists don't go that way for exactly that reason - come over town bridge and join gyratory  in Portsmouth Rd.
@citycyclists there are easier routes if you know them but none great and not well signed
@matthancockmp @stchfundraising doing Surrey Half Marathon - when are you running?
Cold, biting wind for cycling but always better than rain.7.17 with seats spare - Fridays always quieter
Cold, biting
@Surrey_Guard @crusty_uk @GfdSustrans @charliestylist email me and happy to let you know what response I get.
@crusty_uk @GfdSustrans @charliestylist @SW_Trains modern guards van is an excellent idea; often only just enough room for folding bikes
@crusty_uk @charliestylist I have and will continue to raise it with them!

9.30 oral questions to Ministers in Dept of Business, Innovation and Skills;10.30 questions to Leader of the House
@jamielreid I can't believe they did that without even a flicker of remorse for those standing - I sat on my bag but others not as fortunate
If the cyclists should stood up and held their bikes they would free up the 3 seats they are sitting in and the 4 blocked by their bikes!!!
Seats in our dreams only - 4 taken out by some bikes leaning against them....hmm
@eagleradio not me, not this morning!
Late start to the day courtesy of @SW_Trains is not good - seats likely to be in short supply I suspect
7.17 cancelled and despite the apologetic announcements I bet @SW_Trains aren't as sorry as I am.

Main business is Consideration of Lords amendments on Lobbying Bill - due to start at 12.50

@PompeyPaulRoss of course!
Travelling south on a train in an empty carriage - surreal experience......
Good to have Transport Minister down to visit and for him to hear first hand from councillors and business about traffic issues.
@Dufftopia thats early - not sure its worth it for the seat but @SW_Trains are not doing well for seats.

@nicetory @SW_Trains tried sitting across my cycle paneer today - quite effective.
Almost no standing room but would the sacrifice of getting up half an hour early and catching the 7.07 be worth it for a seat...?
Rain makes tension for seats rise and a more complex manoeuvre as we huddle under shelter till the last minute and then dash for the doors!
Just missed 7.17 - unanticipated  rain delayed progress on way to station - - chucking it down now so missed the worst.
@uxbridgewalrus its good to talk!

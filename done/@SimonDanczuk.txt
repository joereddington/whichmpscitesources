Breaking news: Fiona Woolf has resigned
The PM needs to rediscover same spirit of understanding he showed to Hillsborough families & acknowledge why Fiona Woolf must go
This obstinate, hard-headed position that the Prime Minister & others are taking, ignoring mood of survivors, is really undignified
It's showing Govt in a terrible light & ministers need to swallow their political pride & quietly tell Fiona Woolf 2 stand down #CSAinquiry
This is becoming v unedifying & it seems like there‚Äôs a war of attrition between survivors groups & Government ministers over Fiona Woolf
Just about to go on @theJeremyVine show to talk about Fiona Woolf
‚Äú@PaulineMBarten: I am ironing. #loveit http://t.co/KysAo3aNqP‚Äù You lucky devil!

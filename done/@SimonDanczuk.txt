Rochdale stands united against any terrorist activity and we are constantly vigilant about any signs of radicalisation Thu Apr 02 18:24:34 BST 2015
But I have a very clear position on anyone trying to get involved with terrorist groups and that is they must feel the full force of the law Thu Apr 02 18:24:15 BST 2015
At this stage I don't want to say too much until I receive more information from the police on whether a criminal offence has been committed Thu Apr 02 18:23:54 BST 2015
I've been in touch with the father of 1 of young men who was there & he's shocked & confused as to why his son was trying to enter Syria Thu Apr 02 18:23:26 BST 2015

Rochdale has had its problems & no one has spoken on grooming more than me. But to equate every Pakistani with grooming is a racist slur Mon Mar 23 22:17:18 GMT 2015

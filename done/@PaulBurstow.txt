@Lizzieebeth I understand but worry that contribution of charities to NHS being missed. Keys for me are funding & maintaining free access.
@Lizzieebeth work of MPs not only in Chamber. Detailed work done in Committees and lots of other work on behalf of constituents done locally
@Lizzieebeth Bill too far down list of Backbench Bills to have chance of becoming law &does not stop competition or procurement law applying
@Big__Kev must have missed it. What about?
@Big__Kev hi Kevin. Must have missed the thread your referring to.
@lydia_d thanks for the feedback. I don't take any vote for granted.

@AlanRosenbach I know it was tough I also know there were good people trying to do a good job. I think we're in a much better place now.
@AlanRosenbach now read. Quote relates to state CQC was in 2010/11 which capability review exposed. Point was need for external challenge.
@suttonstpastors no. If I can help I will.
@AlanRosenbach haven't see the article. So don't know the context. But in 2010/11 I believe it was in a very bad place.
Great to see Graham Tope honoured tonight by @SuttonCouncil with the award of Freeman of the Borough.
@CoxonGeorge @andrewgregory certainly multi factorial
@Wiltpensionista @andrewgregory good point Brian. The issue is about homes without registered managers and impact of that on quality of care

@MamanCochetRose yes.
@MamanCochetRose I'm sure you do. That's why I engaged and answered your questions. This is down to the owner not council.
@MamanCochetRose @MaryBurstow can you tell me who you are so we can discuss this further.
@MamanCochetRose @MaryBurstow developer chose to sell off with benefit of profit from planning permission.
@MamanCochetRose @MaryBurstow that wouldn't have removed the issue of Ladbrooks. I think it's a bit of a red herring.

@Lizzieebeth I agree we need to ensure NMW is paid and that the sector should be a living wage sector.
@Lizzieebeth but it has, and 80+% in private sector.  In case of residential care the assets are private too.  We have to start where we are
@Lizzieebeth any thoughts of the likely cost of such a nationalisation?
@MCGProgramme @ICR_London thank you for your time. I learnt a lot.
@elderabuseuk the guidance is disappointing it fails to answer the questions I raised during scrutiny of Care Bill.
@John_Gillibrand @LivingWageUK @Demos fair question. We need greater transparency with open book accounting and rate setting.
@Save_St_Helier thank you for your kind invitation. I will take a look at the film you gave the link to. Won't use Twitter to comment on it.

@DaveAsh_ yes I can. Have a good day. See you on the hustings.
@DaveAsh_ 140 characters couldn't do it justice.
@Save_St_Helier thank you for the exchange.
@DaveAsh_ you need to follow your timeline. It's your claims I'm saying are false and your spin on what s119 means a calumny
@Save_St_Helier very colourful metaphor.
@Save_St_Helier do you accept the strategy has nothing to do with the Act?
@Save_St_Helier not on his own.
@DaveAsh_ complete nonsense and another deliberate misrepresentation.
@Save_St_Helier just because it's inconvenient to the myth you want to peddle.
@Save_St_Helier The same arguments were made by the PCTS. The issue is challenging the flawed data and logic that supports the strategy.
@Save_St_Helier wrong question.  There are no grounds for triggering a TSA process. St helier financially improving and clinically sound.
Well done to @SuttonCarers for staging @SuttonCouncil such a powerful radio play to dramatise the challenges of being a carer. Very moving.
@Save_St_Helier still making mischief with that one I see.
@DaveAsh_ what is your point?
@Save_St_Helier nothing to do with the Act.
@Save_St_Helier @first1001days proposals drawn up by the old PCTs
@Save_St_Helier @first1001days simply not true.

@biffboff75 figure and chronology wrong. You're taking about a prospective increase that won't be finally decided or paid till next year.
@biffboff75 no. An independent pay review body.
@biffboff75 in fact over the past 15 years MPs have not followed independent advice voting for less than recommendations.
@biffboff75 All I was saying was you had your facts wrong. After expense scandal all these decisions were taken away from MPs.
@Auntie_CarolG @normanlamb @nick_clegg point you've missed is that the waiting standards kick in next April and raise the bar on the issue.
@biffboff75 No. That is a proposal  from the independent parliamentary standards authority who set pay, not decided by MPs.
@Auntie_CarolG @nick_clegg no one won the last election. We delivered a fairer better system which Lewis acknowledges.

Just off to the @LSHumanRights to speak about the #careact and how it will reform care in England after 60 years of piecemeal law making.
@Save_St_Helier compared to?
@Save_St_Helier collapsed?  Surely the decision by CCGs to abandon it was the right decision?
@Save_St_Helier no I was correcting your error.  BSBV was started and largely conducted by PCTs.
@tezlee1 @ukhomeoffice please ring my constituency office tomorrow morning and/or send email check out my website for details.
@Save_St_Helier worth noting BSBV started by PCTs not CCGs.
@Save_St_Helier perhaps you need to catch up on the history of BSCH and how many ¬£mn wasted by PCT
@Save_St_Helier will come back with details later. I'm attending local @aircadets meeting.
@Save_St_Helier you're right PCTs weren't perfect.
@Save_St_Helier I dispute your cost claim. No changes to NHS trusts & FTs which account for vast majority of service.
@Save_St_Helier just checking. I don't recall any elections for them nor do I recall local professional & executive Ctt meeting in public.

@JoDickoLFC thanks for acknowledging good @LibDems MPs. Delivering 75% of our manifesto and willing to act on evidence.
@JoDickoLFC @LibDems evidence not opinion. Happy to be condemned for following the evidence.
@JoDickoLFC the point is that based on evidence that emerged from evaluation we concluded policy was not working as intended.
@JoDickoLFC ok hardly #Grown-upPolitics response. Govt  evaluation of 'bedroom tax' made clear unintended consequences. We've acted on it.
@JoDickoLFC @LibDems @AndrewGeorgeLD oh of course should never be willing to change your opinion if facts change. #Grown-upPolitics
Just voted for @AndrewGeorgeLD #AffordableHomesBill which fixes 'bedroom tax'.
Tory attempt to derail Lib Dem bill to fix 'bedroom tax' by procedural device to kick it into the long grass defeated 264 to 236 votes.
Lib Dem bill to fix 'bedroom tax' passes 306 votes to 231 votes. Disappointing Tories ignored Govts evidence it wasn't working as intended.
I've cancelled my meetings today to go to vote for Lib Dem bill to fix the 'bedroom tax'. http://t.co/aDRFnjMPLj Voting now. Result soon.

Minister in @HouseofCommons debate on puppy sales said he will write to Councils to clarify the law over licensing of breeders businesses.
@This1sally @pupaid absolutely right.  It is a great way of giving a dog a new home and something more people should consider.
Spoke in @HouseofCommons debate on puppy & kitten sales told Minister status quo is not acceptable & public expect higher welfare standards.
Hoping to take part in @HouseofCommons debate on puppy and kitten farming to press Government to toughen up animal welfare rules.

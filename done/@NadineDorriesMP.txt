@nicola_jones5 as I WAS brought up on one and I'm not pretending like Thornberry - absolutely nothing
@GlynisWinestein @LiterallyLowe @EmilyThornberry Emily Thornberry claims she did

@Pietros1 @ITV I'll do my best, Sir! *salutes with a smile*
@Pietros1 @ITV well as I don't claim expenses and use my salary to cover costs related to my job, I'm not sure what you mean
@selfregulate I can't I'm afraid - I chaired the evidence session of the committee stage of the Bill which means I'm not allowed to vote
@emmersonslaw that is the saddest tweet on my timeline :(
@JimmieHendrix01 @BullshineBilly every day, Twitter is for fun, not work
@HessleLabour and when I was in, parl was on recess I missed no gov votes and had spent the summer recess in my constituency

Well, given all the rude things Edwina Currie said about people who go on @ITV #iacgmooh I'm totally amazed at her hypocrisy. #Iwasfirst :)
@misshoknews @BedfordTC Get that hat off Mrs :)
@angusthewestie1 stay on here though,  I love you!
@angusthewestie1 that's a shame - I think the policy of transparent accounts is preferable due to high levels of abuse on FB and Twitter
An odd feeling to flick the channels and pass yourself ! @itv2 just ran #iacgmooh past clips - very funny

Of course, I very much hope Ed stays, #PrayForEd
@TheDecider25 @IainDale Why? because that winning three elections was all tosh?
The way it's looking now, could happen within days...unless hubris has already set in, in which case, it will all be too painful to watch
Labour MPs have no mechanism to remove EdMill - the process of public humiliation/ pressure to resign is the only road they have to take
@TimelessTimeLtd Parliament was on recess when I was in the jungle and I missed no Gov votes - sorry if you were taken in by media hype

@LeeDHudson @BBCLondonNews @BBCNews hence the reason I don't claim ANY expenses
The lack of substantive legislation and the amount of poor 'going nowhere' opposition day debates is a sad fact of coalition life

@lee_masterson not me !!
From the @times winners and losers - guess who is the the biggest loser. http://t.co/T6LqPAeItK
Wild horses wouldn't drag me down a lobby to vote for that

@idmoly no idea, but I know it wasn't a No1 bestseller
Would people please ask him, the man, how he finds time to be an MP and write a book, or is it a question reserved for female MPs?
I would just remind the leftie haters of my novel writing , Labour MP. Alan Johnson has written two books this year.
@Grove164 @dizzy_thinks I don't. I don't draw expenses and pay for my own Westminster accommodation which is the cost of my salary
@gabyhinsliff I asked in the library last week when they were looking for someone would anyone do it, a loud 'NO ' and a no one watches back
@gabyhinsliff that is quite true and the 9/11 revelation was good, however, that was one i v and I'm not totally sure they needed to do it
@dizzy_thinks do you think as many people are as upset with Labour MP Alan Johnson writing a book as they are with me?
@yorkierosie The Mirror, really, the Mirror, do you think they would print anything as open and truthful as that about Labour?:)
@Krisp06 agreed, AF is a very rude and arrogant - no longer cuts it
#bbc needs to up its game in political presentation. Dull, boring, male and ageing wig wearing men losing the plot don't cut it anymore
When the Mirror, the most biased of all newspapers prints this, you know Ed is in deep trouble. The plot thickens  http://t.co/PIbxiXgGg5

Concerned at some of the political undertones in rhetoric this AM anyone using HCSA as political football should hang their head in shame
There may be nine people on the enquirey, but the lead must have full public and victim confidence - Fiona Woolf no longer has that
Fiona Woolf has to go. Appointment now smacks of 'jobs for the girls' @timloughton should chair the HCSA enquiry, he's beyond reproach
@Gottzy well, you are a bit of a knight in shining armour! Twitter needs more people like you to make it a better place for everyone
The @GuidoFawkes dinner was great fun. In the world of politics and media, as the saying goes, anyone who was anyone was there!
I've just won an award at the @GuidoFawkes awards dinner - but I'm not sure what for!
@MarkFoxNews not me :) are you here?
Great night at the @GuidoFawkes 10 years awards dinner!
@ISangster65 @ZacGoldsmith yes
@JPEde @ZacGoldsmith I most certainly hope we do!
It will be interesting to see how many MPs vote for @ZacGoldsmith amendment of recall with no strings or caveats
@ChrisBryantMP that's clear
It would seem that @ChrisBryantMP is making a strong speech against recall stating he puts his trust in the people of the Rhondda

@CharlesSuntai @OwenJones84 @NewsAllied ? I've no idea what or who you are talking about so could you cut me out of the loop please
Today I wrote the bones of my first short story. Don't get all this' it's more difficult than a full book' stuff. #minesprobablycrapthen
Loving the autumn weather - just finished first bout of writing, time for a walk and kicking up the leaves with Lady Darcey
It just breaks my heart to read Tweets about dogs that have been stolen/ missing 😢
@Bandrake I think you should listen to what he said John and he worked for Labour before 2010 - he is a good, apolitical man
@pauljholmes Her's do that! A la spatchcock - they are the smartest and funniest dogs. She says hi to Pip :) http://t.co/juDe3k2RoH
The Labour attack on Lord Freud backfired in a spectacular fashion - watch Angela Eagle's face turn red with anger http://t.co/rYElzIf8v6
@pauljholmes  Paul, they are identical! Darcey has stolen my heart - everything revolves around her :)

Funny review on Amazon re The Four Streets - someone complaining that they lay awake all night worrying about the characters - so sweet :)
In Parliament to vote on Referendum Bill. Hopefully, this time Labour and Lib Dems won't vote it down and deny the British public a choice
@twinofken Ah thank you, it's up to @Matthew_Wright :) not me
@TrueblueBritish @screwlabour @TimSwinyard @LouiseMensch @Khyberman thanks Tony!
@Yah_Reed @Lord_Monteagle you speak for yourself, not for the lovely scousers who come up to me in the street and speak to me #troll

On another note,the boys on the #apprentice are screwing it up big time! #gotenacity
To deal with the 'outrage' on my time line, no, of course I don't think disable people, should earn less than the minimum wage, obviously
It's a new day and a new fuelled by faux outrage, PC trial by Twitter. The mob leave Judy Finnegan and move en masse to Lord Freud
@HarryPaye I'm not sure Centre Parcs or many of the keen employers in my area would appreciate that
@jamieblanc why would you think people in training/workfare is a bad thing? Give people skills to work not trap them on benefits for life
Many are now one one of the new apprenticeship schemes and more starting soon
Wow! the number of young people claiming JSA in Mid Beds was 536 in September - today that figure has reduced by a massive 372!
Don't forget to go to @blinkboxbooks to win one of five signed copies of The Four Streets ...an easy way to grab a free Christmas present !
@StevenBown I think they would know exactly what I meant and wouldn't try to play the not so smart card
@swinfan69 @Matthew_Wright So, so many - don't marry her maybe. There isn't one I don't like

It  won't be Alan Johnson who takes over from Milliband, it'll be Everton supporter, Andy Burnham ... See what I did there?
That of course was the question from the interviewer - my contribution focused on the policies we need to adopt
Just finished interview with @LBC on the hot topic of the moment, how to stop UKIP
That was one huge spider I just flattened !

@LouiseMensch @TimMontgomerie Any other comments you would like to make when you put the pop bottle down Louise?
@LouiseMensch @TimMontgomerie Parliament was in recess and I didn't miss any votes, unlike you, who worked a three day week until you quit
@heidiallen75 Congratulations ! Best feeling
Enough of politics - it's time for #Xfactor2014
@LouiseMensch @TimMontgomerie As you were very definitely 'forgotten' by Cameron. If I am, I won't desert my seat and hand it to Labour
@HareCensus @InspGadgetBlogs in Clacton and Manchester, that is the demographic of both those seats

The Labour Party has to tolerate some pretty nasty sexist individuals who troll and blog bile in the name of Labour activism.
To the nastier trolls and obsessives -take a look at my profile and read what it says on the top of the book
Great to see Ampthill Town Councillors busy holding a surgery in Waitrose this morning - I even took them a complaint of my own!
@BethRigby @OwenJones84 in exactly the same way I have every time I have been asked ...
@RobertCorkEsq @BBCAllegra for me, when I began to remember where I had put things and could get dressed before it became dark again
@RobertCorkEsq @BBCAllegra no, it isn't - as a new mum, I couldn't get dressed before 1pm !
I had to turn down #newsnight tonight, which I've just realised means I missed a chinwag with @OwenJones84 ! #sadface

@Rosiecosy if there are, after last night, I reckon it will be from Labour
Labour majority fallen from circa 6000 to 600 in Heywood and Middleton - UKIP vote up by c 10,000 since 2010 - Ed Milliband will be blamed

Labours scaremongering in left wing press re the NHS is a sign of their desperation and moral vacuity as it is the poor they scare with lies
On @GMB I made point that there is trolling and people who use Twitter to compulsively obsess about another individual - that is terrifying

Darcey on the blog. I'm thinking of getting her a Twitter account?  http://t.co/n3OkN69oae
Keen for Parliament recall. I will vote for air strikes on the evil wickedness that IS and is a threat to us all and be proud to do so.
@TimMontgomerie Darcey says, thanks uncle Tim :) x

Labour MPs already campaigning hard against English MPs only for English votes but want Devomax and more English £ for Scotland.
@SarahWop19 @Telegraph No probs, easy done - good luck with the book
Labour have to be joking if they think English people will stand for them voting against English votes for English MPs re Devomax

I RT a vile bigot to out and shame him him and I'm blamed for his comment! Did you have the same prob @DanHannanMEP ?! It was your RT
@SarahWop19 @JasonDolan @Telegraph others outing and shaming him - a RT is never an endorsement
@SarahWop19 @JasonDolan @Telegraph in order to shame him I to doing so - I was highlighting what a disgusting person he was and along with
@SarahWop19 @JasonDolan @Telegraph I think you misunderstand how Twitter works - he has now deleted his vile comment which was RT by many
@SarahWop19 @JasonDolan @Telegraph Er...why? The RT was to shame him not endorse!
@IainDale I thought you sounded as though you had a cold! :)
@markmcan @andymcsmith yet again, really sorry, have no idea what you mean but am going to block you as I think you are prob a troll
When boundary commission scrapped my seat, I voted for it -right thing to do. Scottish MPs will have to vote to have no say over English law
@markmcan @davidyoungmb @andymcsmith Hi, I can assure you I have no 'pals' I fight all my own battles on Twitter - I detest trolling
David Cameron needs to put the 'plan' he and Gordon Brown have discussed on the telephone before his own MPs and recall parliament  FAST

Now is the time for English MPs to negotiate a better deal for England

@rachaelvenables maybe you should do some research
@rachaelvenables I'm in shock at his lack of knowledge and blatant misoginistic writing
Are there no female journalists working at the independent? @andymcsmith I take it that you approve of high profile women being stalked?
You haven't spoken to me so in order to write that you must have spoken to him @andymcsmith
@andymcsmith one of his victims is a journalist - maybe that will alter your perspective
@andymcsmith you are a very sick man On behalf of his dozens of very real victims whose lives he has destroyed, yes, and for a long time

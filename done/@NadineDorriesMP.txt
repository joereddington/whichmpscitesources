@cloughies And back to grant aided courses Mon Apr 27 15:21:31 BST 2015
@cloughies So, less courses and re introduce skilled based education and back to the old diploma system Mon Apr 27 15:21:19 BST 2015
@cloughies subjects only - the 50% target is wrong as so many don't complete their first year. The cost is high bcse of numbers of courses Mon Apr 27 15:20:14 BST 2015
@cloughies So do my three daughters - I believe the state should pay you to attend uni, but I also think that uni should be hard core Mon Apr 27 15:19:09 BST 2015
@cloughies if you have any impression that I am in any way 'phobic' that would be entirely, totally, wrong Mon Apr 27 09:56:53 BST 2015
@cloughies However, I'm attending my first gay marriage in June of two constituents who told me to vote against! Men eh! Mon Apr 27 09:55:41 BST 2015
@cloughies well, I can't win them all. However, on gay rights issues, I voted the way the gay community in my constituency asked me to Mon Apr 27 09:54:54 BST 2015

@mrplug But you keep displaying your acute lack of intelligence and keep on being manipulated by a sick liar - Thu Apr 16 23:33:50 BST 2015
@mrplug He is sick, he will be caught. The police have a raft of statements from his victims, some, much worse than I have had it Thu Apr 16 23:33:04 BST 2015

Imagine if I asked for only donations below declarable amount and into my personal account please #verydodgy #debtstopayeh? Wed Apr 15 11:41:15 BST 2015
@Phil13A @Annkell should have one which is transparent and doesn't specifically state ONLY donations below 50 quid declarable amount! Wed Apr 15 11:39:51 BST 2015
There are plenty of open and transparent web sites such as kickstart and Go fund for that sort of thing. #dodgycandidatealert Wed Apr 15 11:22:27 BST 2015
Any candidate who asks for donations into a personal bank/ pay pal account and ONLY under the declarable £50 limit is seriously dodgy Wed Apr 15 11:21:18 BST 2015

@rhysghughes I would say that as a writer, it's nobody's business. Any teacher/Dr/ nurse out there wants to do the same, go ahead. Wed Feb 25 22:27:11 GMT 2015

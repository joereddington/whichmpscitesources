@Privateallergy you live in a socialist nirvana. The NHS is free only at the point of delivery. Wee pay for it through taxation.
@CllrYoung perhaps the Labour candidates in Stroud & Gloucester can answer them to @GlosCitizen @BBCGlos @PunchlineGlos @GlosReview
@daftolddickyBA1 No words will ever restore the damage done. But we must all learn from it, and those who represented Rotherham especially.
And question 4: give us one good reason why Scottish MPS should vote on laws that don't apply to Scotland?
Question 3: since ONS has shown UK borrowed > than any other Premier League nation 2004-7 isn't it time to say publicly 'we got it wrong'?
Question 2: now that this Govmt has closed over 700 fake colleges/immigration scams is it time for an apology to the British people?
Question 1 for Labour Conf: why did you allow cover ups of the NHS Mid Staffs & Rotherham child abuse scandals?
@Privateallergy NHS not resolved in 140 characters but the solution is absolutely NOT just more taxation

The "full fiscal autonomy" SNP election pledge would be devastating if implemented, as it would lose Scotland £7.6bn: http://t.co/JDfsZZt3j7 Wed Mar 25 07:55:26 GMT 2015
Labour £2.5bn UK-wide health spending plan means millions for NHS Scotland but SNP plans would scrap the Barnett formula which delivers this Tue Mar 24 22:48:47 GMT 2015
Week after week for 284 weeks patients waited & staff struggled. Our NHS needs Labour's proposed investment. #NHSSOS https://t.co/3CTgzt0Fp1 Tue Mar 24 21:44:15 GMT 2015
At this election, only Labour would tax mansions to put £250million into Scotland's NHS. The SNP policy is to abolish the means of doing so. Tue Mar 24 21:07:47 GMT 2015
The Tories are so arrogant & increasingly confident that they could win again thanks to the SNP – they're even debating a THIRD term leader. Tue Mar 24 20:45:03 GMT 2015

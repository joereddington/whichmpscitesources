@richardbaum If by 'they' you mean the great British public I will say "That's democracy".
@kevcow @cllrjamesdaly Yes Gross figure going to be about £66 billion (more if this surcharge is added)
@richardbaum no as I said I don't believe we should have to pay to #EU in first place
@richardbaum of course
.@richardbaum  1. Congratulations on being selected as LD PPC for #BuryNorth again 2. I would not be paying £ to #EU in first place!
If we don't pay £1.7bn to #EU we could divide up between every constituency and @BuryCouncil would get £5m+ #BetterOffOut
@SJLSouthworth Odd Lab did not bother with it in 13 years.
@blah_blahblaah  I agree but there has been no 'slashing and burning'- Simply ensuring country lives within its means.
@blah_blahblaah It is not idealogical it is a simple truth , It is not right for us to spend money next generation will have to pay back
@HeatherHolcombe No If you do not like Page 3 of @TheSunNewspaper or any other newspaper don't buy them #Freedomofchoice
@blah_blahblaah Having a strong economy is the only way to have strong public services. We must stop spending borrowed money.

@lalonip No not at all. Bury Council is Labour controlled + Bury Conservatives oppose the plan.
@Smallbrainfield Just a case of time taken to agree details of  new Bill with all parties
@Smallbrainfield This had all party support. The House sat 3 hours longer and actually we were only restating what is the existing position.

Informative insight on women's cricket from @ConnorCricket @Heatherknight55 at #AllPartyCricketGroup dinner
.@jane_emanuel  Yes-Because the last Lab Gov spent billions of £ they did not have + set revenue budgets that were utterly unsustainable
@johncoles I have read it actually.
@Gazmonst Con Cllrs will be opposing it but Lab controlled Council  will have final say. Could lead to more fly tipping.
@johncoles  No I want the police & the security services to have the powers they need to keep us all safe.
@flatcapsandmild it just keeps things as they are. I am in favour of the security services doing all they can to keep us all safe.

No success for my 326 number in #privatemembersbillsballot but 318 321 322 and 333 all in Top 20 3 of top 7 slots gone to LibDem MP's
@jane_emanuel Very few. Of course as @BuryCouncil realise they are appropriate for certain jobs plus some people actually prefer flexibility
Unemployment down by 129 in month to May 2014 in #BuryNorth 129 more people who have the security of a regular income -but still more to do.
Good news that more people are finding work and getting the security of a regular pay packet http://t.co/MUfBr8Oj47
@peteenty62  I would go with EU Referendum Bill that was scuppered in @UKHouseofLords last session

@flatcapsandmild well I wouldn't put it like that but I do support the use of shale gas
My view on opinion polls never get too excited never get too despondent #experience
@typograph if you include your home address and you are a #BuryN constituent I will reply.
@TheLEFTslayer  @LordAshcroft does not predict anything he is merely reporting a snapshot of opinion in April
@SJLSouthworth Quite right but two years ago Lab won 6/8 wards this year 4/8 Cons going forwards Lab going back.
@typograph Not very often anyone accuses me of spinning the party line! I am only stating the facts you can decide who did well
Lab  % lead over Con in 8 #BuryNorth Wards in @BuryCouncil election down from 10.9% to 3.5% since 2012
2/2 Lab vote down 7.5% 10915 to 10090 UKIP vote up from 2939 to 4746
Total who voted ( exc spolit papers ) in 8 #BuryNorth wards up 10.5% from 23493 to 25951 Con vote up 9.7% 8370 to 9179 compared to 2012 1/2

@flatcapsandmild Spending money on helping flood victims does not change the overall financial situation savings still required.
@flatcapsandmild It is absolutely right that when it comes to the relief effort it must not be constrained by any lack of money.
@samnutt73 Flooding  - no easy answers. Int Aid (obv not disaster relief) should be linked to economic dev plan in recipient countries.

@jimmyfrith Better to cut income tax of those on lowest incomes as Gov has been doing as part of its #longtermplan
@Sandgrounder74 ...or perhaps because trade unions were planning strike action.

Pleased that @jameswhartonmp Bill to give #BuryN residents their say on #EU has moved on a little further today despite Lab opposition.
@funkysential No, it is not and I am arranging for the wrong information which has been posted on the LF website to be corrected.
@fusilier50 I am sure you will want to tell them all the truth.
@fusilier50 I voted for the Amendment Division 130 on Wednesday it is clearly in Hansard
@fusilier50 I signed and voted for the amendment I don't know where you are all getting your story from but it is wrong!
@fusilier50 This is simply untrue. I voted along with John Baron MP who was a Fusilier and leading campaign to save #RRF2
@fusilier50 I did not. I voted with John Baron MP who was a Captain in the Fusiliers and who is leading the campaign in Parl to save #RRF2
@Northumbria4  I voted along with John Baron MP who was a Captain in the Fusiliers and who is leading the campaign in Parl to save #RRF2
@Northumbria4 In what way do you think I have been 'traitor'?  I have voted to support the Fusiliers
@fusilier50 Pardon In what way do you think I have not stood up for the Fusiliers?

Pleased to be able to put case for Removal of Spare Room Subsidy on @bbcradiomanc earlier and if I may say so a balanced package and report
@graemelambert Tax avoidance is legal. Up to Parliament to draft tax laws without loopholes. Tax evasion is illegal.
@graemelambert @jimmyfrith Lab decided not right to subsidise spare rooms in private rented sector not right in public sector either
@jimmyfrith No!
@TamoorT No It is Labour's policy to spend more on welfare. @Conservatives are putting an end to the something for nothing culture
@RikiLeaks23 @FilthyPlucker @jimmyfrith  No. Whoever is elected has the right to govern.
@FilthyPlucker @jimmyfrith @rikileaks @GeorgeMonbiot I have now Thanks
@SFODan Long term as economy grows higher rate taxpayers shld benefit from lower tax not more welfare benefits. System does need simplifying
Astonishing Labour using opposition day debate reinforcing message: "Labour will spend more on welfare" Tories helping #hardworkingfamilies
@FilthyPlucker @jimmyfrith I agree it would be better if more people voted but I do not believe voting should be made compulsory
@FilthyPlucker @jimmyfrith It is up to voters whether they vote or not. Huge engagement with voters still might not result in high turnout

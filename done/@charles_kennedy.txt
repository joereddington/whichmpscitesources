For 13 years Labour opposed a #MansionTax. This vote was a transparent political ploy and seen as such. A shame
good news that the feasibility study supports the @FlytoSkye campaign. Flights to Skye would bring a welcome boost for the local economy.
Delighted to hear the sporting rights for Raasay are back in the hands of the local crofters. A costly mistake for the SNP. #Raasay
En route to campaign for @mike4eastleigh.  A local champion and the right choice for #Eastleigh
Very worthwhile meeting with Highland Council today on welfare reform. Food for thought on how best to protect most vulnerable constituents.
The Raasay sporting rights decision is a deplorable one. Once again the SNP are putting cash before communities. http://t.co/g39h4uajcw

Unfortunately due to the predicted bad weather, it has been thought wise to postpone tomorrow's  surgery. Rescheduled date to follow.
Congratulations to @swilliamsmp for his success on votes for 16 & 17 year olds. The back bench motion was passed by 119-46
I would urge parliamentarians to support votes for 16 year olds. If you are old enough to fight for your country, you are old enough to vote

Just recorded my video message for @justiceborders. An extremely important campaign.
Great to hear cross-party views on the #indyref. Great shame the SNP put little stock in the value of today's debate. #bettertogether
Happy to support EDM 869. It is unacceptable that those in the Highlands are being forced to pay a postcode penalty. http://t.co/Z0NTfuBR
@labourwhips, like their motion, not to be trusted. I voted against their motion and abstained on 2nd reading. Fact.
I formally abstained frm voting for a 2nd reading and am looking now to work with like-minded Lib Dems to amend the bill in its later stages

Good work by Lib Dems on @HighlandCouncil, delivering a fair budget with more money for services despite difficult times.
If @RobGibsonMSP wants to decentralise the Highlands, I hope he’ll oppose SNP plans to centralise the police in Edinburgh!
Welcome news on reopening the A890 from mid-February, but must keep pressure up for a long-term solution.
@NewScotGirl I don't support separating Scotland from the UK politically (or geographically, for that matter!)
@gerry_4 Yes, I support keeping the UK.
@G4rve @scouriebeast I hope to play a full role in the anti-separation campaign, but still in early stages!
Large bonuses from public-owned companies aren’t right at a time of austerity. The highly paid should take their share of the strain.
@TLearoyd Please feel free!
@JohnLoughton I do, it would help the lowest paid who are struggling at the moment.
Raising the tax threshold is a common sense measure to help struggling people. Glad it’s on the agenda.
@ChristinaSkye Sadly, I don't think I'll be able to make it this year. Apologies! I hope it's a good evening as usual. CK
Glad ferries running at Strome, but help needed from Scottish Government for permanent solution. Great work from Cllr Biz Campbell on this.
@heatherthevet I try to buy local indeed! But the service is free, so no conflict.
@kateordeath Feel free, but it's focused on the local issues most important to my constituents. CK

Merry Christmas to all my constituents and friends.
Excellent news for the Highland sleepers – the Scottish Government will match Coalition funding! Glad SNP ministers have seen sense.
Smooth sailing for the emergency tugs until April, but the SNP need to work with LD ministers for a sustainable solution later on.
It’s vital that we all respond to the sleeper consultation. Go to my site at http://t.co/3JPWXnQ5 and I’ll pass constituents' views on.
Best of luck to @RogerCrouch1 in Feltham & Heston. I'll be watching the result with interest.

Next year's @ccfest Big Top on Skye is a huge opportunity. Where could be better to celebrate Scottish culture?
Hope #scotstorm isn’t causing too many problems. Follow @HighlandCouncil for updates on bridge, school and road closures.
SNP’s Infrastructure Plan says no new improvements on the A82 until 2017! Too many vague promises, too little real action.
Hope everyone is coping with the snow today. Check http://t.co/VlS0QVDR for news on the roads. http://t.co/26oF45KK
Good that there’s a commitment on the A9 at last. But we still need serious work on the A82!
We now have the chance to secure the future of the sleeper. The Scottish Government must work with Westminster on the investment plan.
Delivery charges in the Highlands can be ridiculous. Skye CAB are campaigning against them – take their survey to help. http://t.co/3m3OgfC2
I’ve written to the Scottish Transport Minister to ask him to invest in sleeper trains. We can’t let this vital service be retired in 2014.
Fuel duty cut in the islands begins in March! Achieving policy I've fought for since 1980s. Now to bring it to the whole Highlands.
Concerned for people who committed to solar panel scheme on high tariff, then told they’d get low one. We need a fair deal on solar power.
Congratulations to James Wink, the Inverness College Apprentice of the Year! More good news at BSW Timber.
Spoke on Coastguard in Commons today. Glad Shetland & Stornoway saved, but we can’t gamble when protecting our coast.
Good news that West Coast prawns will be sold in Sainsbury’s. Environmentally friendly, healthy & delicious. Great news for local fishermen!
With the High St redevelopment, BSW investment and Hollywood films it’s an exciting time for Fort William! Glad to see it.
Rural buses are critical for elderly & vulnerable people. Glad the Elgol-Broadford route is safe, but must ensure people don’t lose out.
The Fort William sleeper is vital for the west coast. I urge everyone to say so in @transcotland’s consultation: http://t.co/Ptcw68Fz
I’ve just come from the Commons’ chamber fuel duty debate. Trial cut in the Islands a good start, but must reach everyone in the Highlands.
Michael Foxley has done sterling work for the Highlands. There’s no-one more deserving to be Local Government Politician of the Year.
Glad Hollywood taking an interest in Glencoe’s stunning landscape, but disappointing that local views weren’t sought before closing the A82.
Very pleased that the Olympic Torch will be heading up to Lochaber next year. The Games have to be about the whole UK.
I’m concerned about out-of-hours NHS coverage in Glenelg & Arnisdale. However remote the community we all deserve the best standard of care.

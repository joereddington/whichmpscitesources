@SteveRotheramMP
@OwenJones84 It was like watching a re-run of the old Lib Dems today with the Kippers. They believe they can now say anything with impunity.
@cllrkemp The record has been officially set. You could always try to better it if you want?!
@CliveEfford Congratulations on all your hard work.
@jreedmp Haha. He's a card that one!!
Voted in HoC @ 1.40 and made the train at Euston for my Advice Surgery in double quick time (2.07). Eat your heart out Usain Bolt.
Delighted to be a co-sponsor for today's National Health Service Bill and also for the Zero Hours Contacts Bill in the House of Commons.

@IanProwse Digging Your Scene.
@RoscoeHead @FairDeal4Locals Yes, I think there will be lots of MPs who vote in favour of NC2.
@FairDeal4Locals @RoscoeHead Cheers. I'll look at that when I get down there later.
@Ellis_Samizdat @GetintothisHQ yes, big live music fan. I'll ask Louise is she aware. Thanks.
@Ellis_Samizdat @GetintothisHQ I'm not aware of it, not been informed, but probably because it's in Louise's constituency?
@TonyBellew good luck Bomber, the City is right behind you.
@KeithMullin Playing footy or gigging?
@Mike4SBET What!?
@mainstandred @joeforliverpool Don't remember that part of the sermon.
@DanJarvisMP @JHkentspur It's on my 'to read' list mate. I've still got 5 others in chronological order. Just need some spare time now!
Lots of talk of Justice in the inauguration and instalment service for the new Bishop of Liverpool. 2 new church leaders working together.
@RoscoeHead @FairDeal4Locals Sorry mate I will be in Brussels in meetings that have been scheduled for many weeks.
@TheresaMEP @LucyAndersonMEP Looking forward to our meeting  in Brussels this week on tyre safety.

@PaulSmithJnr Great to see you earlier mate. I didn't get served for a while and nearly missed my next event.
@TerryMac777 @LFC Bit of hair dye and you would've look a day older!!
@reid6peter @Ian_Rush9 You'll be well back to give us a hand by then mate.
@Ian_Rush9 @reid6peter Reidy doesn't even get a chocolate on his pillow in his B&B.
@Stuartbigbro2 Sorry Sandra and I were lightweights and had to leave early. I believe @craigbigbro1 was worse for wear!
@JaySheridan22 Agreed mate. I think the lighting was wrong!
@HighamSteve  It's not a very flattering photo I have to agree. I've sacked the photographer!

The last intervention was; the question "that the question now be put", now be put. Shambles.
It's actually getting worse. The Speaker has put a double negative motion to the House to vote whether there will be a vote I think?
@CatherineCorcor Yes, but this was of epic proportions! Shambles!
@Fanxxxxtastic It's chaos.
In the Commons watching the worst shambles Members say they have ever seen as Tories attempt to avoid a vote on the European Arrest Warrant.
Sometimes Twitter can be abused and a platform for vileness, but the tweets about Remembrance Day commemorations have been fantastic.
@TownHallLpool @StGeorgesHall @lpoolcouncil Yes, I thought this addition to the usual great service was very welcome.
@brokenstones66 @MarchOfTheMods @TeenageCancer @cavernliverpool That's brilliant that mate. Great charity too.

@JonMorter @PrincessLisaL @TheFarm_Peter @BritishRedCross @shorncliffe95th Work your magic again mate, it's another brilliant cause.

@AntMack76 @andyburnhammp If you are that bothered I hold 5 Advice Surgeries per month and have an open door at my constituency office.
@AntMack76 @andyburnhammp Not true, the lad I went to Lille with (a wagon driver from Kirkby) went to Anfield for years - and he's a blue.
@sweepsbarbersh1 Ditto.
@AntMack76 @andyburnhammp The q is why would you automatically think it was a freebie? I go to hundreds of events every month. Why this 1?
@sweepsbarbersh1 Sorry but don't need one. Happy to visit tho, but I've said before that you need to email or contact my office - 525 5025.

@brokenstones66 @PaulWellerNews  Left a Solid Bond in Your Your Heart and mine mate.
@brokenstones66: @PaulWellerNews was deffo a bitter pill to swallow! Apologies for that! You might have started a pun fest.
@PaulWellerNews in fact it is 32 years.
@PaulWellerNews is it really 30 years since a certain Paul Weller broke my heart!?
@scoutimpact Congratulation, looking forward to welcoming you to the Speakers State Rooms.

@TheRagamuffins @Daily_Record Think you'll find that Liverpool is part of the UK and we didn't either. We are a Tory free zone!
@ScouseTims Just because I believe in something that the majority of my Party also does, doesn't equate to me towing the Part line.
@ScouseTims @UK_Together A reaction to the polls which show it is less likely.
@ScouseTims @UK_Together The real issue is how the markets responded on the first occasion the Yes campaign were ahead in the polls.

@HelenLees6 @RosieRockhill @pupaid You are engaging, but you're not a constituent of mine and it is they who will decide my future thanks.
@RosieRockhill @HelenLees6 @pupaid I think I'll end this ridiculous stream. I haven't said I won't be there.
@ScouseTims Still recovering from the last one mate!
@HelenLees6 @pupaid If you are one of my constituents email me as it is they I answer to.
@ScouseTims @amck188 Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. And sleep!
@HelenLees6 @pupaid Yes, but it's not the only commitment I've got and it is unlikely there will be a vote on the issue.
@HelenLees6 @pupaid Didn't realise that you ran my diary and other commitments for me?
@amck188 @ScouseTims Didn't say he was stupid anyway. Said "Don't be stupid". Very different connotations.
@pupaid Got something on for that day, but haven't finalised diary for next wk yet, so can't commit, but am sympathetic to the issue raised.
@ScouseTims if you want to debate the issue, I have 5 Surgeries per month.
@ScouseTims can't you see it's simply wrong to use the premise of one subject to argue another?
@ScouseTims No we're better than that. We're Better Together.
@dinga1957 @DianaJohnsonMP @Independent Not really, but it is quite stark when you see the actual percentages.
@ScouseTims don't be stupid. Only someone with twisted logic could conflate the two issues. Well done you.
@ScouseTims Why are you trying to use my feed for a totally unrelated issue? Oh and BTW I happily support the better together campaign.

@MichaelLee51 Don't mean to-but having never met u I can only guess what you're like from what you tweet. Meet loads of mean spirited Tories
@MichaelLee51 You obviously haven't looked mate.
@MichaelLee51 I think the opposite is true. There are perfectly legitimate arguments for democratic socialist policies if you look beyond u!

@jay_robbo Why don't you stand against me then?

@KevanJonesMP @mailonline Will Cameron be outraged enough to name and shame him like he specifically did with @jimmycarr ?
@LisGibo @waltoncentre Yes, it's got a real friendly feeling to the place. They saved my neighbours life when she had 4 bleeds. #itsournhs
@Dominic_Dunn22 Hope you're well mate. Enjoyed your spot at the Camp and Furnace after the film about Liverpool's music history.
Delighted to open the new Jefferson ward at @WaltonCentre earlier. Lucky to have such a fantastic facility locally. Great staff.

@PaulSmithJnr I actually had tomato with my mixed grill I'll have you know Smigger. Salad dodger indeed.
@terry__smith come on, you know - it's the only way, burn those carbs.
@Noordad Bud and kebabs at the mo.
@curlsoflove I always find sliding down the stairs on your back is not only a quick way to descend floors, but a free back massage.
Top diet tips - ahem - eat a little less and diet a little more. I thank you!
@grahamenwright Dodgy curry then?
@MrJMaxwell Ah, didn't think of that. On it right away. Cheers.
@Harry_Cross_ So many political punch lines, but I won't be tempted!
@birko1972 No, not on a diet, but ensuring I get plenty of fluids in Dublin.
@lord_vimes5 No, but I've still got my trowel if I need alternative employment!
Looks like the Wi-Fi connection in a Dublin hotel is non too secure, so if you received a message from, please ignore as I've been hacked.
@MrsMosscockle I'm working with @stellacreasy on it and we are approaching our contacts as we speak.
@stellacreasy @jimkillock @CCriadoPerez ...those responsible will be receiving a knock on the door from their local constabulary. 2of2
@stellacreasy @CCriadoPerez Simply no excuse for this behaviour whatsoever. It isn't 'banter', it's potentially criminality & hopefully1of2

@rideforthe96 @andyburnhammp Not sure as I'm at the Workers Memorial Day event on 28th. What time is it starting and from where?
@IanLaveryMP Goldfish bowl mate.
@IanLaveryMP I'm on my way back to Liverpool myself, so see you there!
Gutted about Anne's passing. Sincere condolences to her family. Nothing stronger that a mothers love for her child. RIP.
@CllrNickSmall Totally agree Nick, he is a gentleman and a valued former colleague. Well deserved recognition.
@jimnoakes @jreedmp @migo984 @tomharrismp Not the cheap ones either. Jaffa cakes, kit kats, twixs, etc. Better than you get at home.
@jreedmp @migo984 @tomharrismp @haroyousofian Had a text from Rapide saying wind-ups have started. How did they know?
@jreedmp @tomharrismp @haroyousofian You do realise that there will be those following this thread that actually believe this is possible?
@suityerselfsuit Done.
@tobiasgade Couldn't agree more. They should do a lot of things, but have been getting away with it for decades.
@jreedmp @tomharrismp @haroyousofian Double drat. Missed out.
@fionamacmp Don't know but I was tweeting about @JohnBishop100 -photo was of @jreedmp. One's a Liverpool supporting comedian-the other...etc
@LpoolWaltonCLP Never misses the chance to use someone else to gain a bit of self publicity does our Ed. Last time it was @JohnBishop100
@jbgriffo7 Don't think 'duty bound', but personally I always do my best. Sometimes timescale is too short, or tour fully booked for example.
@IanDonovan1989 It depends. If you include your full address, you can email me on: http://t.co/f7miJ6ilql@parliament.uk
@MarkButchard Well let me tell you Mr Butchard, you are in a very small minority. I worked on local issues from my office.
@chrishall1 She was PM and it's protocol. Other former PMs not afforded a quasi-state funeral, eg Wilson/Callaghan & Parli wasn't recalled!
@tobiasgade Agreed that Hacking is a crime, but serious criminals shouldn't be able to profit from their crimes.
@MarkHBurton @denise_fergus If the petition reached 100k, it would simply trigger consideration by the BBBC committee for a debate on issue.
@moorsy134 No.
James Bulgers mum @Denise_fergus has till the 4thMay to get 100k to sign http://t.co/2UgutHroi4 now everyone RT & Sign Sign Sign !!!!”
@rideforthe96 @andyburnhammp I'm sure Andy said he'd do the lot with you?

@TheOKFoundation Well done for all your dedication to get to this point. It is a brilliant achievement to get a Parliamentary debate on SADs
@LoveLeah93 @andyburnhammp warmed up - yes, recovered - NO. I'm sore in places it's hard to describe on twitter! #loveleah
@canyoukuwk @terrierstour @lpoolcouncil It is an exceptional play with a very serious message regarding gangs and crime. Recommended.
@ClarkAnge @jakelabour @theokfoundation Both @andyburnhammp and myself will be speaking in tomorrow's important debate.
@xandyxdavies @andyburnhammp The problem is I am so sore in the nether regions after 28 miles on a seat like a razor blade!
@xandyxdavies @andyburnhammp Haven't ridden a bike for 40 years but really enjoyed the Salford to Walton ride today for the LoveLeah charity
@AnnaYearley You should have read what I originally wrote!
@jreedmp @AndySawfordMP That's just.... Well....simple, but incredibly funny.
@PeterHain Great piece Peter.
@keithdibs Thanks to all your wonderful guests for a great night at the Aldershot CLP dinner. Hope you could all understand me?
@johnmcdonnell10 No. One looks like a mate of mine, but has a pint in his hand. My mate Fletch doesn't drink, so it can't be him!!
@AnnaYearley Haha, hope the old girl is feeling much better today!

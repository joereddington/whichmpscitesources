@ciarale01 thanks - very good blog!
@ruthallenonline @Channel4News Thanks, Ruth!!! Really important this!
@PeterReeve Thank you, Peter. Appreciated! It is so important. Both moral and economic case for investing in mental health - overwhelming
@RhiannonDuggan 2/2 Lib Dems introducing access and waiting time standards in mental health forces commissioners to treat it equally!
@RhiannonDuggan but point is that when physical health has a whole range of access and waiting time standards, this drives where money goes!
@HaileyBailey Thank you! Really appreciated!
@iankugler hang on! You only wrote last Thursday didn't you? We will reply!
@CCLeicsPolice @paulfarmermind @CrisisConcordat @MentalHealthCop Some great local leadership - now every area needs to act!
@JB4GB where did you send your email?
@JudithBuntingLD @astronomeradam @normanlamb: This is very exciting. I admire their ambition and leadership!  http://t.co/Fe0GwNyyhn
This is very exciting. I admire their ambition and leadership!  http://t.co/Fe0GwNyyhn
@JudithBuntingLD @astronomeradam it is absolutely an issue! Impressive work in Devon to challenge inevitability of suicide rate.

@PaulBurstow @Demos @ClarePelham @ashcrofts @SimonA_Tunstall @HC_One @JulienneMeyer Thanks, everyone for coming in. V interesting discussion
@pinkfootcley @NorfolkCC @BTOpenreach Thanks for alerting me! Sounds ridiculous! Happy to pursue if u could provide details to my office
@HaydnJeavons So our plan to introduce comprehensive access/waiting time standards starting roll out next yr - crucial to get fair treatment
@HaydnJeavons 2/2 This drives where the money goes. Whole system focused on meeting physical health access/ waiting standards. MH loses out!
@HaydnJeavons because for years physical health has benefitted from patient rights to access treatment whilst MH patients have none. 1/2
@HaydnJeavons That's why we have secured funding to introduce first ever access standards in mental health from next year - including EIP.
@ciarale01 I'm ok! Good to hear from you! How are you?
@LSammas1995 @katsladden I will meet with you. Do contact my office at department of health.
@leedargue @NBsLovelyLinda @scottishliberal thanks you lot!! Brilliant!!!

@allaroundislove @GeorgeJulian @JusticeforLB @DHgovuk That's exactly the approach I try to take. Families must b able to challenge decisions

@AndrewRendle Will do!
@GeorgeJulian I constantly mentioned people! That's how I framed it at the start: how we achieve a system totally focused on people!
Let’s tackle damaging mental illness stigma which prevents people from seeking help when they need it #mentalhealth
Unacceptable 'psycho ward' & 'schizo patient' Halloween costumes are still being sold in 2014 – retailers sort it out #mentalhealth

@KathVickeryF1 @DHgovuk @WLMHT This sort of appalling wait is why I have secured the introduction of max waiting times in MH staring next yr
@grahamsphillips Thanks a lot for this! I will have a read!
@Ermintrude2 @MindCharity their survey looks at the much greater investment in physical public health measures compared to public MH
@Ermintrude2 @MindCharity I spend my life applauding brilliant people leading great services - as with mental health awards in Sheffield
Mind raising an important issue today re spend on public mental health by local authorities. Lots of evidence of impact! @MindCharity

@elderabuseuk Not sure of point you are making? V happy to respond if you want to write to me. I'm v positive re changes we're introducing
@AndrewRendle Haven't spotted them. Can you email me at DH and say that I asked you to do so?
@peterkinderman @DrG_NHS @joke_co_uk Outrageous. Dreadful reinforcement of stigma! @TimetoChange challenges these attitudes!
@nickiwestwell @ACandG @NNorfolkLiving Thanks. Have you contacted my office so that we can check diary?
@SaintSwith @radiowoodley Really enjoyed my visit! Keep up the great campaigning for local people!

@THEAGENTAPSLEY @kilian_bourke @julianhuppert We are on course to meet our IAPT target - by next year about 900,000 people per year!
@NorthernMHSW physical health,CCGs are forced to meet those - at expense of MH - where no standards exist. Total bias. We r changing this!
@NorthernMHSW I don't know the details in your area but what happens around country is that because there's clear waiting standards in (1/2)
@NorthernMHSW Lib Dems have been clear. NHS needs more funding for '15/16 and then £1b extra each year. £500m extra for mental health!
@CraigEdwards01 Thanks so much. This is really important. I will keep doing everything I can!

@DrAndyMayers @valeriewalsh19 @dorsetpolice @PCCDorset @DorsetHealth @DorsetCCG Fantastic! This concept shows real promise!
@valeriewalsh19 I agree - Crisis Care Concordat sets standards in crisis MH care for first time. It makes v clear this has to change!
@JoshWillsWorld @mencap_charity @CBFdn @SarahNewtonMP @itvthismorning Thanks and good luck!

@DrAndyMayers @BBCRadioSolent Sure. Do contact my DH office. Thanks for interest!
@VKParkash there is loads of brilliant work done by professionals - it's the way it's commissioned and organised which I think needs change!

@mcpherson_ian Yes!
@BristolSHS do send in your thoughts.
@mummabearuk @BeresfordPeter @suffolkcc Thanks!

Belated Happy Birthday to Jessie Brooks! 100 years old yesterday! Enjoyed my visit to Hickling House in Hickling! http://t.co/YRGu1juuh2
@Jo_Orme Right - thanks for alerting me - and send my best wishes!!
@Jo_Orme @BBCNorfolk thanks for useful information!
@justeditor @BarringtonFarm Excellent!
@BarringtonFarm I have it down for Friday! Hope that's right!
@riverthames09 I am writing to the council about it! Sorry you had that experience.
@riverthames09 I will investigate!
@tom_watson @theresecoffey @EastEnglandAmb No!
@FoxHedgehog @dwilliamsHSJ @no1cromer Very impressive!
@dwilliamsHSJ @FoxHedgehog @no1cromer I've never seen that side of your personality!!
@FoxHedgehog @dwilliamsHSJ @no1cromer Sorry!!
@dwilliamsHSJ @no1cromer I'm impressed!
@dwilliamsHSJ @no1cromer Very true! You should come and try it, David. Cromer is brilliant in summer sunshine - and rest of year!!!
V positive news on economy! Lib Dems taken the difficult decisions, stuck to plan. Now seeing growth and creation of record numbers of jobs.
Fantastic food at a stunning location @no1cromer http://t.co/urdBxeqsxx
@Duncangreen11 It was brilliant! Everyone enjoyed it! Keeping fit and having good fun - just what goes down well with the minister for care!
@no1cromer wonderful food, stunning location! http://t.co/WQLzfN92TE
@timmcdougall69 @cwpnhs That is so good to hear. If I am likely to come to your area I would love to visit. Diary is a nightmare though!
@timmcdougall69 Agreed!
@farmersonfilm @eye_4_business Very impressive!
@eye_4_business @farmersonfilm Just watched it on a train in Sweden - here visiting great integrated care for older people! Really impressed
@TomMeindl Looks bad! We have also had bad storms and flooding!
@EstherNtverk Fantastic visit to see great joined up care in Sweden - patient's priorities at heart of everything. http://t.co/W1V8xzL9fR
@Callum4Corpusty I hope Vodafone are listening! I will take it up with them!
@JBPostle_Cromer @HouseofCommons  Quite!
@Homesforwells Thanks for your sympathy!
@BradleyHatch @sandringham Thank you v much!
@IanNorris99 Nightmare!
@JBPostle_Cromer @HouseofCommons  Pleasure! Hope all is well in Cromer! Just had nightmare journey to London. Train took 4 hours 15 minutes!
@greateranglia information has been lacking. We've seen 2 inter city trains go straight through - having left Norwich later than us!
Another great experience by rail to London! Left at 7.40 am - now stuck on platform at Shenfield! Total chaos - tree fallen on wires.
@JackieLeotardi Thanks. I have watched video - completely respect her view. But it's legitimate to have different views on this issue!
@martyndadds @RoyLilley @irisbenson100 @theRRNetwork @YouTube I think you're right. I've been v encouraged by reaction to our new guidance!
@martyndadds @RoyLilley @irisbenson100 @theRRNetwork @YouTube Really encouraging video! Thanks for sharing it.
@NorfolkArtspace @TSMCartoons @BillOddie @TimetoChange Great initiative! Thanks to all those involved!
@gregjudge Sadly not! In Norfolk!
@Nigel_Pickover Looks good!!
@sarah_wootton @DrJackyDavis Thank you!
@gregjudge Thanks, Greg. Appreciated!
@Guy_Stallard @WRhysM @TheAbbeyfield @LivingWageUK Excellent!
@Girl_Interrupt_ Absolutely not!
@p2w_Ltd Good to meet you both!
@KDPEP64 @mcpherson_ian @patmmc2 Agreed!
@Callum4Corpusty @vodafoneNFK @VodafoneUK @nthnorfolknews @thedeniseb Thanks for alerting me. I've seen Vodafone response. Hope we clarify!
@JamesWThurston @Jenny_Drew @valeriewalsh19 @ShaunLintern @BACP @UKCP_Updates Well I certainly understand that!
@Jenny_Drew @valeriewalsh19 @ShaunLintern I want to expand range of NICE approved, evidence based therapies!
@ProfLAppleby Compelling those with MH problems to do therapy won't happen under Coalition! Parties are free to put anything in manifesto!
@info_eat @ProfLAppleby my comments are in the Sunday Telegraph report!!!! The bbc also quotes my disagreement with it!
@info_eat @ProfLAppleby I have made it very clear - I don't support compulsion!!!!!
@valeriewalsh19 @ShaunLintern Coalition has built workforce and massively expanded access but need to go much further! 2
@valeriewalsh19 @ShaunLintern We must expand IAPT programme. Lord Layard & David Clark have pioneered brilliant evidence based prog. 1
@Katcopley My aim is to continue massive expansion of evidence based psychological therapies. 750,000 to benefit this year.
@Katcopley I don't support compulsion. It would be a costly tick box exercise with unwilling participants.
@Nolliag66 @TimRossDT I am quoted in the article! Not a good idea!!!
@gordonmilson Thanks for your interest and commitment!
@JasonGinnelly1 It's essential that Trust does deal with you. Families must be listened to!
@gordonmilson I've been v clear that young people must be central to this process - and I totally agree re families!
@gordonmilson Do make contact with my DH office and make clear I asked you to!
@gordonmilson yes exactly. That's what I'm working on! We've announced taskforce to thoroughly review commissioning & whole way CAMHS works
@NotSureJustYet Agree with this as well!
@WirralRecovery @gordonmilson very wise! That's what we have to aim for!
@gordonmilson very much agree!
@elainenchurch @BBCr4today of course we do but establishing waiting time standards in mental health is critical to fair funding!
@kentpioneers Great work!
This week we've launched consultation: stronger Code will lead to better care. Follow @MHcodeDH + visit http://t.co/8dZlUSs3fO #MHCodeDH
@ChrisCocliff it's quite important to do it properly! We are ending an unacceptable exclusion of mental health from waiting time standards!
@BBCr4today What's really needed is to end exclusion of mental health from waiting time standards!
We have mandate commitment to start process of introducing MH access and waiting time standards from next year! MH excluded from 18 weeks.
Interesting intervention from new Pres of Royal Coll of Surgeons on waiting times. Big change needed in waiting standards in mental health!
@mroutled @incontrolorg Do write to him and copy me in.
@valeriewalsh19 @WirralRecovery @KayFSheldon Thank you for taking the trouble to get involved!
@compassion_heal Good to meet you. Thanks for coming in!
@KayFSheldon Absolutely - already been heavily involved in drawing up con doc as I requested! C p 6/para 1.4 on p 7 https://t.co/lmBDBQwQLW
@ashkarmstrong @DebraOliveri2 I trust you will get a response v soon!
@allaroundislove @Emcoconoir @JusticeforLB @chrishattoncedr Do send details to me - and make clear I have asked to see your email!
@SIMON_SALTER Great to meet you! Thanks so much!
@mroutled Agreed - but it is positive!
Just met Simon Salter - great movement to prevent death from testicular cancer #feelingnuts @check_one_two
@GeorgeJulian @TLAP1 @WinterbourneJIP True!
@JusticeforLB I completely understand the frustration. Culture is more entrenched than I'd hoped but do think things r starting to change.
@Emcoconoir @jesslinworld I know!
@InclusionLondon V good to meet you all! Thanks for coming in!
@CromerCreamTea @rebeccarowe @CromerHighSt Excellent!!
@AudreyClark3 and morning to you as well! Thanks for the message!
@rebeccarowe That's great news. Will be brilliant for children in Cromer - and visitors!
@rebeccarowe Fantastic! Do let me know when it is happening!
@pigreen @atriumonline @BillOddie @equallives_org @TimetoChange It is to raise awareness of mental health and combat stigma!
@CapellaCentre great to see you both! Good luck with a highly worthwhile project!
@Ryburghshop Brillaint. Hope everything is going really well!
@DebraOliveri2 essential that all NHS organisations respond effectively to complaints!
@cllrsimonallen @nickclegg @PaulBurstow Looks brilliant! Congratulations to everyone involved!
@peterwoolf57 @myRJ_UK @ACCGarryShewan @Staircase2 @sharmilapurryag @Stevepriestman @NorwichLEAP @NorfolkPCC @Nat89atk  Good morning!
@Minghowriter @MailOnline @FT @DAAcarers @Jeremy_Hunt Of course!
@Minghowriter @jmcefalas @MailOnline @FT @DAAcarers very much agree!
@Minghowriter @legalaware @MailOnline @FT @DAAcarers There is a simple fact that v many elderly people do live alone with family living away
@Minghowriter @MailOnline @FT @DAAcarers @Jeremy_Hunt I'm not blaming families! Point I'm making is extended families now dispersed!
@DiCornell1 @MuseumBroads @StalhamHigh Thanks for inviting me. Really enjoyed it! Impressed!
@CarerwiAttitude @killhopelaw totally agree!
@DusaFishStas @sarasiobhan @billatmacintyre do send me details! Send via my website and mention that I have asked to see it personally!
@killhopelaw I understand that and agree! And the work you and so many others do is enormously valuable - and appreciated!
@MuseumBroads @StalhamHigh Enjoyed meeting students from Stalham High! They've done great work on really good project with Museum of Broads!
@MuseumBroads I really enjoyed my visit. What a fantastic place the Musuem of the Broads is! Thoroughly recommended!
@killhopelaw Any Government will face the same challenge. The numbers living with chronic conditions and no.s over 85 r rapidly increasing.
@AnitaDows @acorns47 @archangelolill Exactly the point I'm making. We have to collectively do something about all those who live alone!
@caremessenger Thanks a lot!
@mroutled @ADASSdavidp @SimonAtDH Good to hear!
@changepeople_ @lumos Brilliant!
@changepeople_ @lumos Good to hear it!
@ZawarP @changepeople_ @lumos Thanks Zawar, for your role today! Appreciated!
@ZawarP @changepeople_ So sorry I can't be there!
@SP_Physio Totally agree!
@sammynoonoo @BwDCCG And sincere thanks to you! Really appreciate your kind words!!
@CatherineWilton @uk_james There are great areas doing just that! Local areas need to recognise power and effectiveness of voluntary sector!
@laylamoran @TheOxfordMail @LibDems Fantastic!
@wigglyampsltd @CommShow So sorry! Only just seen this. We should meet up! Could we fix time over summer?
@tweetcmw It's precisely what I DON'T want! Very strong belief in NHS!
@barls13 @ShelllDavis Also, there will be new fundamental standards for all health & care providers - serious breach cld lead to prosecution
@barls13 @ShelllDavis we are introducing the same tough inspection regime in care as in health - with ratings of providers.
@LizzieBuckle2 I'm also looking forward to the meeting. Great admiration for these campaigners
@ShelllDavis Totally agree. We are introducing the ability to prosecute providers and directors - & creating a new offence of wilful neglect
@jonoread Thanks, Jono. Really appreciated!
@mroutled OK!
@mroutled Very happy to assist!
@MumsnetTowers Thanks a lot for alerting me to this. I completely understand the importance of this subject!
@TommyTommytee18 @SteveRotheramMP @andyburnhammp It was a great event - and celebration of brilliant House of Memories!
@SamJLane Very pleased to hear news of Mental Health Crisis Care Concordat event in East of England on 4th July!
12,000 die from breast cancer in UK per year. I'm supporting @BCCampaign's #spreadtheword campaign to make sure it stays a top priority 4 UK
@spiralhealth Great article! I love this approach! Excellent staff leading development of their service!
@charm97uk Thanks to you and may others to alerting me to this important issue #miscarriagecare I will look at link!

@maryohara1 @MrJonnyBenjamin Thanks, Mary.
@BipolarBlogger @MrJonnyBenjamin It reduced me to tears. Very powerful message of hope!

@AudreyClark3 @EricPickles @BwdCommPrint @Brentwood_BC Good news! Well done!!
@JR_MerseyCare @DAAcarers @Mersey_Care Joe, is your assessment standard in places of safety 2 hours or 4 hours?
@jirobb @Mersey_Care Brilliant!
@JR_MerseyCare @Mersey_Care Thanks so much, Joe, for inspiring visit! You've got a great team doing brilliant work changing people's lives!
@BFraenkel @Mersey_Care Really looking forward to it myself!

@TeenMindTweets Where did you send it?
@Rubywax Great to meet you. Really interesting discussion!
@MHPF_ @Steve_Shrubb Appreciate Steve's words. We have great leaders in mental health who can help secure reform and improvement for people!
@MensHealthForum @WorkFoundation Enjoyed it. Really good report!
@DannyOShea93 @AudreyClark3 @MensHealthForum @BwdCommPrint @EssexMHC very impressed!
@PsychiatrySHO @NSFTCrisis @444blackcat 3) MH loses out! That's why I'm trying to introduce access/waiting standards in MH!
@PsychiatrySHO @NSFTCrisis @444blackcat 2) 18 week waiting time standard only applies to physical health. sucking money into acute trusts!
@PsychiatrySHO @NSFTCrisis @444blackcat That's exact right. We need a big culture change - and we need to remove institutional bias in NHS.
@livingwithlowes Will have a look! Thanks!
@BipolarBlogger @PsychiatrySHO we have a big job to do in spreading the word. Mind have agreed to lead the effort around the country!
@djmistress3333 Thank you!!!! Really enjoyed it!
@livingwithlowes Great to see you all!
@PsychiatrySHO @444blackcat Appreciated! Thanks!
@PsychiatrySHO Commissioners must secure the necessary support locally.
@PsychiatrySHO Thanks for highlighting this. It has to change. Crisis Care Concordat is clear re standards which must apply everywhere.
@cinders91 @claspcharity I'm taking part!!!
@GeorgeJulian @AnnaHepburnDH @ClaireatDH Whole process wth Care Act has been the most collaborative - and we have amended a lot in response!
@AudreyClark3 @WorkFoundation @BwdCommPrint Looking forward to it!
@areynolds67 thanks a lot! All these things are critical! You are right!
@peterwoolf57 Morning Peter!!

@RoyLilley @ClaireCNWL Sadly, I'm not in London today. I will get office to make contact.
@RoyLilley @ClaireCNWL can we meet so that I can hear your first hand experience?
@GemmaLouGould @Ermintrude2 @GeorgeJulian I'm deeply distressed by lack of change! Sadly u can't force commissioners to give people a chance
@IWasForReal @TheDragonCafe Looks v good!
@TheGlobeWells Very impressed. You have done a stunning job! Beautiful building!
On the balcony of the Golden Fleece in Wells-next-the-Sea - what a stunning location!
@normanlamb: With Rick, Sarah & Marie at coffee point, Kings Lynn. Brilliant W Norfolk Time Credits! @justaddspice http://t.co/DvT9hjY6ro

@n_robertson17 sorry! I've tried to find justgiving page but nothing comes up. Only 'localgiving' which requires me to register with MAP???
@n_robertson17 thanks. Found discussion v interesting & positive. I will do a donation. Seems complicated online! Where can I send a cheque?
@killhopelaw @CareQualityComm I agree that is not acceptable! Do email me via my website.
@heal_regulators When you write in make clear that I have specifically asked to see your email!
@heal_regulators do contact my office at DH!

@VictoriBleazard thanks a lot for organising! Really worthwhile!
@Andy_JS_ I think the guidance recently published gets it right - and seems to have been widely welcomed!
“@c_ingram33: @GdnSocialCare Ive been restrained face down -I believed I would die & some of us do die. Norman Lamb you are amazing! Thanks!
@c_ingram33 @GdnSocialCare Many thanks! This is, in my view, a big advance!

@Nolliag66 thanks. Can you send me details at Department of Health?
@TheRetreatYork Do send details! Thanks a lot!
@HewsonJack @LibDems @EDP24 @nthnorfolknews I've  asked my office to provide me with your email and will reply this weekend.
@HewsonJack @LibDems @EDP24 @nthnorfolknews if you can't make that surgery appointment then we can of course offer another.
@winyr9 YES! Good project!
@HewsonJack @LibDems @EDP24 @nthnorfolknews My office tells me they wrote to you last week. Understand they offered a surgery appointment?!
@Bob__Hudson @JonNHSNorwich @edballsmp Remarkable run and good manager!

@suebakerTTC @bisgovuk  Fantastic! So pleased! Progress is being made. Need to get all of Gov leading by example on @TimetoChange
@Privateallergy @LisaSaysThis @EvanHD @BBCr4today I have condemned that decision on tariff which cannot be justified!
@Jkbmedic @BBCr4today That wasn't that point I was making. It's the powerful targets/levers which apply in physical health but not MH!
@claireOT @chrishattoncedr @Stephenmackem Totally agree! Just been talking to social worker from Salford where commissioning is done well!
@AliJaneMoore @LisaSaysThis @EvanHD Agreed! Completely!
@BrendanAtess @BBCr4today thanks a lot. This is incredibly important!
@burniethebolt thanks and really appreciated!
@TinaThudBump @ChrisGPackham May be impossible due to v full diary. If you have key points to make do get in touch!
@RedCatSarah @ChrisGPackham thanks for alerting me. V full diary might make it impossible - if u have any key points to make do get in touch
@TheOKFoundation do check with my office! Thanks!
@KirstyIvanoski Certainly!!
@HorningSC Fantastic! Loved it! Thanks a lot!
@WadeTovey @EuprioNic agreed!
Horning Boat Show today - lovely event. Horning Sailing Club took us out for a quick sail! http://t.co/RBMjsVBtg1
@AtosMiraclesfb Thanks a lot for alerting me. I take the concerns v seriously. I look forward to receiving the petition.
@pigreen @PaulStephen8 not sure what you mean by a national welfare service. I strongly advocate integrated care!
@pigreen @PaulStephen8 Strongly agree re social enterprise!
@mellojonny @piedfly good to hear!
@EuprioNic I totally agree. We need high training standards and corporate accountability in care services!
@EuprioNic Agreed!
@Michaeltbryant that's fine. You can email via website.
@EuprioNic I totally agree! I'm very discussed on that as well!
@Ermintrude2 @JohnPMcBeth we have power to require CQC to undertake targeted inspections on local authority commissioning.
@sky_larking @julianhuppert I do not argue for cameras placed in every care home - they can have a role in investigating abuse/neglect!
@richardmills18 @BBCNews CQC are looking using both hidden cameras and doing 'mystery shopping' where concerns exist.
@H_S_Alliance @mroutled @shirleyayres @AlanRosenbach Brilliant! Thanks!
@H_S_Alliance @shirleyayres @AlanRosenbach I've always stressed importance of involving good providers! Frustrating!
@Ermintrude2 fully recognise it's not enough on it's own. CQC will inspect against crisis care concordat. There will be other mechanisms too
@Ermintrude2 @KayFSheldon @HSJnews I will not give up! Determined we get there. It's not about money!
@Ermintrude2 I can't wait to meet! You assume I'm just cynical - but changing culture of LD commissioning is nightmare - but essential!
@LRatapana Thanks. Like everyone else I feel very strongly about this!
@marcemendoza that will be great!
@lindamascot @paulbentham @sj_robinson Good to c u & colleagues! Good luck & thanks for hospitality! Great Lib Dem campaigning in Chelmsford
Hello Marcela, how is Mexico? Good to hear from you! Seen the bungee jumping photos! Besos!
@Delayed_Again @akcrisp @priti4witham @ben4ipswich @greateranglia It certainly didn't feel like special treatment tonight!
@dspritely @DebraClaridge @CareQualityComm @gjpone Quite!
@chrisgowman Reading your ministerial box next to the 'out of order' loo - a glamorous life!
@Jezfrombez @greateranglia what a nightmare!
@cynthiaphillip1 @greateranglia Quite!
@greateranglia 7 pm from Liverpool St but maintenance of facilities too often not up to standard!
Come on @Greateranglia surely it's not too difficult to have water in basins! And two toilets out of order and another blocked! Not great!
@PARITYFORMH Fair point!
@LeonieGreene Leonie, you are really kind! Thank you!
@PeterBingle Peter, you are a real gentleman!
@theresecoffey oh blimey - hope you have a seat now!
@theresecoffey arrived at Manningtree and finally a seat!!
@claspcharity Found it really interesting! Thanks a lot!
Joy, been standing all the way from Liverpool St and even after Colchester still no seats in sight!
@dspritely @CareQualityComm and you need properly trained staff and a culture of care and compassion!
@dspritely @CareQualityComm But David, there has to be effective accountability when dreadful things happen. You also need inspiring leaders
@PeterWalshAvMA @CareQualityComm Duty of Candour is critical! Thanks for all you have done to make it happen!
@paintoolkit2 Done!
@TinaQ60 @CareQualityComm That's exactly what we are doing. Not talking but legislating to give  CQC the power to prosecute!
@robmcd85 @Privateallergy @KayFSheldon @JOHNDLEWIS54 @CareQualityComm Agreed!!
@age_uk Always v keen to work closely with Age UK!
@KayFSheldon @robmcd85 @JOHNDLEWIS54 @CareQualityComm Agreed. CQC has essential role & needs effective powers but challenge for society!
@H_S_Alliance @NHSEngland Thanks. Really helpful. Do please contact Bill Mumford of Joint Improvement Programme.
@JOHNDLEWIS54 @KayFSheldon @robmcd85 @CareQualityComm I applaud Panorama for their work. Up to each & every one of us to expose failures!
@cjfaraway @e1ucidate @TinaQ60 @CareQualityComm And we r doing what I said we would do - introducing power for CQC to prosecute & much more
@PHSOmbudsman very important campaign!
@TheCockerel No problem! Very best, N x
@THEAGENTAPSLEY @CareQualityComm We inherited this flawed system. We are changing it!
@THEAGENTAPSLEY @CareQualityComm CQC has to serve a notice before prosecuting. If co complies then nothing can be done. We r changing that!
@TinaQ60 @CareQualityComm That's changing. CQC will get power to prosecute directors & co. Plus fit & proper person test for directors!
@robmcd85 @CareQualityComm Agreed. That's exactly what we are doing! Thanks!
@TinaQ60 @CareQualityComm Agreed - and we are introducing a statutory duty of candour - those who cover up serious wrongdoing can be charged
@allaroundislove @CareQualityComm Agreed. That's exactly what we are doing. The current rules are flawed! Impossible to prosecute providers
@ShelllDavis @BBCPanorama I realise how difficult that will be for you. Keep strong!
@keanem1971 @betwitch @DAAcarers @BBCPanorama @CareQualityComm problem is CQC can rarely prosecute under current rules. We are changing that
@ShelllDavis @BBCPanorama I agree! That's why we are introducing the power to prosecute when fundamental standards of care are not met!
@WinterbourneJIP Totally agree!
@HulbertMathew Also, new robust inspections and ratings, compulsory training of staff with new care certificate, new chief inspectors.
@HulbertMathew We are doing loads: effective corporate accountability with ability to prosecute, fit and proper person test for directors.

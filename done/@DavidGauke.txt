Good hustings in Rickmansworth tonight. It was Tring last week; Berkhamsted on Wednesday. Mon Apr 20 22:48:52 BST 2015
The fiscally irresponsible SNP could be running the show within 3 weeks. Only one way to vote to stop that happening. #VoteConservative Mon Apr 20 11:35:50 BST 2015
In summary, SNP's manifesto consists of more borrowing, more borrowing and more borrowing. Does anyone believe Miliband would resist that? Mon Apr 20 11:30:42 BST 2015
Croxley Rail Link v good news for residents of SW Herts & Watford. But could be at risk if Labour minority govt making concessions to SNP. Sun Apr 19 18:32:05 BST 2015
Nicola Sturgeon makes clear that she'd be in a strong and powerful position over a minority Labour government 'throughout the Parliament'. Sun Apr 19 09:37:37 BST 2015
'The SNP would be in a very, very strong and powerful position' says Nicola Sturgeon. You have been warned. Sun Apr 19 09:30:55 BST 2015
The day spent campaigning in SWHerts & Watford. Clear that (1) growing concern about a Labour/SNP combination & (2) UKIP vote falling away. Sat Apr 18 18:18:17 BST 2015
The prospect of Prime Minister Miliband held to ransom by the SNP should alarm voters throughout the country #chaos Sat Apr 18 08:44:51 BST 2015
@BBCAllegra Chaos! Fri Apr 17 23:26:06 BST 2015
@nickhurdmp That's very good but it is a 59% fall across the border in South West Herts! Fri Apr 17 20:17:53 BST 2015
.@DouglasCarswell just been told that UKIP will abolish Police & Crime Commissioners. Is this true? It was your idea. Fri Apr 17 18:39:25 BST 2015
More jobs, more vacancies, rising pay. No time to switch to a Party that always increases unemployment when in government. Fri Apr 17 10:41:53 BST 2015
Unemployment claimant count in SW Herts down 303 (36%) in the last year. Down 807 (59%) since March 2010. Fri Apr 17 10:27:18 BST 2015
No wonder the IMF and the German Finance Minister are impressed with our economic plan. Employment up by 2 million over the last 5 years. Fri Apr 17 10:10:53 BST 2015

.@afneil making it clear to @ChukaUmunna that Labour could run deficit at end of Parliament. Not denied. Mon Apr 13 12:26:00 BST 2015
Now Chuka Umunna defends the last Labour's government record on borrowing. They've learnt nothing. Mon Apr 13 12:20:53 BST 2015
IFS confirm that Labour could have deficit of £30bn and comply with their manifesto commitments. Mon Apr 13 12:19:34 BST 2015
If Labour plan to borrow more (which they do), they should be straight with the British public and say that they would borrow more. Mon Apr 13 12:13:27 BST 2015
Ed Miliband reminds everyone that he wrote the 2010 Labour manifesto. Mon Apr 13 11:52:09 BST 2015
This was supposed to be about fiscal credibility. But clear that Labour will never have an overall surplus & won't say when current surplus. Mon Apr 13 11:49:56 BST 2015
Labour borrowed in the boom years, leaving us ill-prepared for a downturn. Their policy is to do it again. Mon Apr 13 11:44:48 BST 2015
Did Labour borrow and spend too much? 'No.' #SameOldLabour Mon Apr 13 11:42:51 BST 2015
Ed Miliband does sometimes come across as a supply teacher who has lost control of the class. Mon Apr 13 11:38:49 BST 2015
Are there any circumstances Labour would have an overall balanced budget? Mon Apr 13 11:36:57 BST 2015
'Please, please Labour activists. Don't act like Militant thugs.' Mon Apr 13 11:32:36 BST 2015
Ed Miliband says he has been 'tested'. That's nothing compared to how the British people would be 'tested' if he became PM. Mon Apr 13 11:31:17 BST 2015
Miliband talks about being 'confident in our place in the world'. But not confident enough to ask the British people about EU membership. Mon Apr 13 11:29:16 BST 2015
'I will stand up to powerful interests [apart from Unite and SNP, obviously]' - Ed Miliband (what he said and what he meant) Mon Apr 13 11:23:28 BST 2015
'Will end non-dom rule', except for the majority of non-doms unaffected by Labour's reforms. It's not an abolition & Ed Balls explained why. Mon Apr 13 11:20:48 BST 2015
How do raise living standards whilst increasing unemployment? Which EVERY Labour government does. Mon Apr 13 11:18:34 BST 2015
To be clear, when Labour says 'surplus' they mean an overall deficit. Mon Apr 13 11:16:28 BST 2015
Ed Balls thinks eliminating the overall budget deficit is 'extreme'. So he would always borrow. Mon Apr 13 08:14:18 BST 2015

2.2m apprenticeships in the last 5 years. Under the Conservatives' #LongTermEconomicPlan there will be 3m in the next 5 years. Thu Apr 09 16:09:28 BST 2015
Great pleasure to attend launch of KPMG's new apprenticeship programme, part of 16k new apprenticeships announced across the country today. Thu Apr 09 14:12:07 BST 2015
Labour should stop taking the British people for fools. If Labour's policy is to borrow more then they should say they would borrow more. Tue Apr 07 12:49:39 BST 2015
One reason why unemployment has fallen so much is that we are making work pay. More of that from today with no income tax on 1st £10,600. Mon Apr 06 10:34:35 BST 2015

@LizMair good to hear from you. Glad you have no regrets! Fri Apr 03 22:54:53 BST 2015
One aspect of Telegraph's Sturgeon story rings true. First Minister thinks Ed Miliband 'not Prime Minister material' #JustNotUpToIt Fri Apr 03 22:51:57 BST 2015
Just had another look at #leadersdebate. Miliband seems to promise to use mansion tax proceeds on putting young people back to work not NHS. Fri Apr 03 21:31:33 BST 2015
So @DouglasCarswell, how is that 'No Angry Nativism' thing going for you? #LeadersDebate Fri Apr 03 10:00:56 BST 2015
If you are worried about higher taxes, higher borrowing and higher welfare spending, the influence of the SNP would make matters worse. Thu Apr 02 23:38:17 BST 2015
Ed Miliband is not even the best left-wing party leader in the UK, let alone best person to lead the country #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:40:46 BST 2015
On substance and performance, Cameron in charge. Comfortably dealt with rainbow coalition of the tax and borrow parties #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:28:06 BST 2015
Cameron has 12 point lead from Comres on most capable of leading the country #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:22:51 BST 2015
Miliband has one shot at being PM. He'll give the SNP whatever he has to #chaos #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:08:02 BST 2015
Remember, SNP want more borrowing and higher taxes. Only a Conservative government can stop that. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:05:29 BST 2015
In a Sturgeon/Miliband partnership, Nicola would wear the trousers #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:03:43 BST 2015
Choice clear - David Cameron's plan or Labour/SNP chaos #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 22:01:57 BST 2015
Cameron offers security, leadership and a clear plan #leadersdebate #CameronInCharge Thu Apr 02 21:58:28 BST 2015
All Farage can achieve is put Miliband in Downing Street #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:57:03 BST 2015
If Ed is Prime Minister clear that taxes and debt will be higher #leadersdebate #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:53:41 BST 2015
Labour doesn't practice what it preaches on zero hours #leaderdebate #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:50:17 BST 2015
Time for Ed to say sorry. Young people suffer when you crash the economy #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:39:07 BST 2015
Costed plan on tuition fees? Really? #leadersdebate #justnotuptoit Thu Apr 02 21:37:39 BST 2015
1m more children in good or outstanding schools #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:35:35 BST 2015
2m more jobs, 2m more apprenticeships, lower debt, more homes to buy. Cameron answers questions with policies #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:31:33 BST 2015
What will Ed Miliband do for young people? Leave them with more debt #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:29:18 BST 2015
When Ed Miliband was in the Cabinet we lost 1/2m jobs #JustNotUpToIt #LeadersDebate Thu Apr 02 21:21:23 BST 2015
Welfare reform, improved education & training and sensible immigration controls. Only the Conservatives can deliver #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:15:25 BST 2015

Miliband tries to weaponise NHS and shoots himself in foot #LeadersDebate Thu Apr 02 20:55:16 BST 2015
Sturgeon bullying Miliband. Let's not have 5 years of this. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:53:33 BST 2015
Miliband confused position on the NHS and the private sector #JustNotUpToIt #LeadersDebate Thu Apr 02 20:48:20 BST 2015
Criticism of NHS in Wales from Leanne Wood. Will Miliband accept responsibility? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:40:47 BST 2015
Round 1: clear win for in charge Cameron on economy #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:35:21 BST 2015
More debt and taxes. That is what Labour/SNP/PC/Greens would mean #CameronInCharge #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:33:33 BST 2015
Sturgeon makes a fair point. Labour voted for £30bn fiscal adjustment but has no plans as to how? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:30:10 BST 2015
Over rehearsed Americanisms not working for Miliband #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:28:27 BST 2015
No going back to Labour's failures says in-charge Cameron. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:26:45 BST 2015
Sorry there is no money. Cameron summaries inherited #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:25:08 BST 2015
Sturgeon backing Miliband on tax rises #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:22:13 BST 2015
HMRC tax yield up from £17bn to £26bn over this Parliament. No government has done more to deal with tax avoidance and tax evasion. Thu Apr 02 20:20:55 BST 2015
I disagree with Nick, says the PM. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:19:06 BST 2015
Sturgeon advocates fiscal irresponsibility. And a Prime Minister Miliband would be relying on her votes. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:18:00 BST 2015
Miliband refuses to say where he will increase taxes. Freezing higher rate threshold? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:15:55 BST 2015
Cameron clear that Labour's financial management would hurt working people #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:13:06 BST 2015
Cameron makes clear we have delivered a balanced plan that is working. #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:08:01 BST 2015
Farage & Bennett don't mention jobs or deficit. Will Miliband? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:05:49 BST 2015

"How are you going to pay for yr tuition fees policy?"

@ChrisLeslieMP: "We'll set that out in the manifesto". Which tax will Labour put up? Wed Mar 25 13:52:05 GMT 2015
"We'll vote for you on tuition fees if you'll not proceed with Trident". SNP/Labour 'vote-by-vote' horse trading would be disastrous for UK. Tue Mar 24 18:20:11 GMT 2015
If Labour were relying on SNP on a vote-by-vote basis, what wd Labour offer to get its legislation through? SNP will want s/thing in return. Tue Mar 24 18:15:09 GMT 2015

@JolyonMaugham how are you distinguishing OTs from OECD countries? Meeting FATF standards? Complying with automatic exchange of information? Sat Feb 07 08:45:47 GMT 2015
@JolyonMaugham A public registry is to encouraged but Labour haven't thought this through. Sat Feb 07 08:39:48 GMT 2015
Logic of Labour's policy on a public register of beneficial ownership would be to blacklist the US, Germany, France & 30 other OECD States. Sat Feb 07 08:36:35 GMT 2015

Re-reading pages 680-686 of 'A Journey', it'll be very easy for Tony Blair to say "I told you so" about a failed Labour campaign. Sun Feb 01 21:57:02 GMT 2015

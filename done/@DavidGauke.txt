@DavidGauke
In 2010-11, top 1% paid £38bn in income tax. This year, they'll pay £47bn. Hard for EdM to argue that under this govt rich pay zero tax.
Top 1% expected pay 27.4% of all income tax receipts. Which is more than zero.
I guess Ed Miliband's relaunch speech won't mention that in last year, employment in his constituency is up 14% & claimant count down 23%.
@GilesMooney @rbeccabeneworth @JolyonMaugham Jolyon's phrase, not mine!
@JolyonMaugham A good description of my life 2007-2010 (speaking as the then 'hapless individual' with the 'special phone').
Looking forward to introducing @TracyBorman tonight for her talk on her excellent biography of Thomas Cromwell at #CWLitFest14.
Number of JSA claimants in South West Herts in October was 598, down 31 on September & 293 (32.8%) since October 2013. Claimant rate 1.1%.

"Don't normally vote Conservative but we're very impressed with @KellyTolhurst. Will do this time." Positive feedback on doorstep in Strood.
@edconwaysky To clarify, the demand we received was £1.7bn, we're paying £850m ... & 850k employers benefitting for #EmploymentAllowance.
Contrary to what some are suggesting, £850k is not the same as £1.7bn & December '14 is not the same point in time as July & September '15.
.@EstherMcVeyMP seems to be very well regarded by Labour people #EM4PM #OnlyExplanation
Given high take-up of #EmploymentAllowance, we now estimate that half a million employers will be be taken out of the jobs tax altogether.
Great to visit @CituUK to discuss their exciting plans for Leeds & the benefits of the #EmploymentAllowance helping them expand.
856,000 employers in the UK already taken up the #EmploymentAllowance. 2000 employers in South West Hertfordshire.
Take-up figures for the #EmploymentAllowance released at 9.30am today. I'll be in Leeds to meet a business that has benefitted #2kCashback
Labour MPs not rushing to back Ed Miliband this pm but the union barons are. They put him there & they'll keep him there. Hopefully. #SaveEd
In Ed Miliband's defence, he is nicer than Brown & brighter than Kinnock. Labour's grumblers should leave him alone. And in place. #SaveEd
Listening to Labour f/benchers & b/benchers discuss tax, it really is as if Tony Blair never existed. Old Labour sickly but New Labour dead.
Today's 50p debate is the first Opposition Day Treasury debate on a tax/spend measure of 2014. Labour have so little to say on the economy.
Alan Milburn says 50p rate of income tax 'absolutely incidental to public finances' 
http://t.co/AjzncRKBx4.
Increasing 45p rate of income tax to 50p will have no behaviourial response at all, say Labour frontbench. Another departure from reality.
If you're one of the millions to get a #taxsummary, you'll see how much tax you pay on your income and where it's spent. #accountability

@RichardJMurphy @ChrisGiles_ So you accept growth matters. Not the implication of your earlier 'growth is not an absolute good' tweet.
@ChrisGiles_ @RichardJMurphy Quite. Plenty on the Left said Government policies would mean no growth. Now they say growth doesn't matter.

@adamparsons1 The rate is 92nd lowest out of 650 constituencies.
@adamparsons1 Yes. To be fair, these numbers are not seasonally adjusted so monthly numbers can be a little volatile. Still, it's good news.
Number of JSA claimants in SW Herts in September was 629. Down by 69 on the month, 306 on the year (32.7%). JSA claimant rate of 1.2%.
Bad news for tax evaders. Agreement reached for Directive for Administrative Cooperation. EU28 sign up for Automatic Exchange of Information

Now that was a proper Leader's Speech.#CPC14
@JolyonMaugham 2009 plans did involve bricklayers having to provide their own bricks in order to be self employed. Not really workable.
@JolyonMaugham The point is our measure addressed problem more comprehensively than 2009 proposal. So where's Lab's extra yield coming from?
.@JolyonMaugham Our measure was wider than construction industry & a case that problem had grown. But agree that we've already addressed it.
Labour tax expert on Labour's tax avoidance claims. http://t.co/St05px2o2c . Ouch. PS Our measure was wider than just construction industry.
.@JolyonMaugham lists "genuinely radical measures introduced by gov't & ones that Lab cd have introduced, but didn't" http://t.co/073H81ZQOQ
.@JolyonMaugham - a Labour voting tax barrister, says nice stuff about me. Unusual combination.  This is worth a read http://t.co/073H81ZQOQ
@JolyonMaugham You are too kind
@gilesmooney :)
Miliband forgot sections on deficit & immigration. I suspect he'll be hoping the country will forget the rest of the speech, too.
We've brought the deficit down but recognise that there is more to do. Ed Miliband has just spoken for 80 minutes & not mentioned it once.
Anything about standing up to the unions, Ed?
I'm sure Miliband would reduce number of low paid jobs. And medium paid jobs. And well paid jobs.
Looks like Labour's 10p rate of income tax will be worth just 50p per week. Our personal allowance increase has been nearly £14 a week.
.@GuidoFawkes sets out very well the point I was making yesterday on Labour's multi-purpose mansions tax http://t.co/BkL6lxdmPX
@TimMontgomerie @bbcnickrobinson About 1.30 in, Rachel lists tax on properties worth £2m+ as deficit reduction policy http://t.co/J9UhbQHBi7
Rachel Reeves to @afneil 'Child benefit is not the only thing we have announced [to get deficit down]. The tax on properties worth £2m+..'
3rd use in 3 days for Labour's homes tax. 10p rate of income tax; deficit reduction; now NHS spending. Another tax that keeps on giving.
@timmontgomerie @bbcnickrobinson And on Daily Politics today, Rachel Reeves said to was going to pay for deficit reduction.
Labour's homes tax was to pay for 10p rate of income tax. Today, Rachel Reeves said it was to reduce deficit. What will it pay for tomorrow?
'If you're going to have national debt falling you have to have a surplus overall.. We have to get national debt falling.' Does Balls agree?
@gilesmooney That's a very good point.
Ed Balls: I like low taxes but..I hate wasteful spending but.. I am pro-business but.. What's the line about 'everything before the "but"'?
Lots of apologies from Ed Balls. Apology for the state of public finances pre-recession? No.
Balls complains about public sector pay freeze - which he supports.
@jameschappers Is he the one who lives in Wuchita?
A small point but telling that Balls consistently misleading on abolition of Sch 19 SDRT, the so-called 'tax cut for hedge funds'.
We abolished Sch 19 Stamp Duty Reserve Tax. Helps investment management in UK but tax borne by savers, esp pension funds. Not hedge funds.
Balls still talks of 'tax cut for hedge funds'. But, as he knows, there has been no 'tax cut for hedge funds'. It is a tax cut on pensions.
@jolyonmaugham Labour's preferred answer was regional assemblies but rejected by North East in 2004. Had 10 years to find new answer.
.hoeykatemp on Radio 4 says she supports #EV4EL. Current position 'wrong & needs to corrected'. How many other Labour MPs agree?
@jolyonmaugham Conservatives fought last 3 general elections on #EV4EL. But it looks like we'll need HoC majority to put it in place.
About to attend Battle of Britain Commemorative Service at St Paul's, Hunton Bridge.
Does Ed Miliband have an answer to the English question? 'We should take our time & not rush into anything.' That's a no, then.
Love to know what every Labour MP representing an English seat thinks about the West Lothian question. Are current arrangements fair? #EV4EL
Question for MPs for English constituencies. Is it fair that MPs for Scottish seats can vote on English only matters?  My answer: no #EV4EL
Economy. Welfare. Immigration. EU referendum. And now England & the constitution. On what issues is @Ed_Miliband not out of touch?
.@David_Cameron more devo to Scotland + EV4EL. @Ed_Miliband more devo to Scotland + er, that's it. Labour ignoring English question.
Have spoken to 2 schools in my constituency today. Pupils v interested in #indyref and vast majority pleased that Scotland voted No.
A good day for the UK. But a sustainable union needs constitutional fairness for England. The PM is making that case. Will @Ed_Miliband?

JSA claimant count down by a 1/3 in SW Herts in last year. 689 in July, down by 344 on a year ago, down 31 from June.
Our welfare reforms & cuts in jobs taxes result in excellent conditions for creating jobs. But these policies would be reversed by Labour.
Since introduction of Employment Allowance in April, bigger share of jobs growth coming from employed rather than self-employed than before.
Unemployment claimant count has fallen faster in 12 months to July than any 12 months since 1973.
@jolyonmaugham Good piece. This is a problem so interested in your proposed solutions.
Pleased that PCS strike in @HMRCgovuk has proved a flop. People have been able to renew their tax credit claims over phone & online.
PCS's HMRC strike this week aims to stop people renewing their tax credit claims by phone. Renew online instead, see http://t.co/2fUttO7Hy1
.@HMRCgovuk's phone lines busy this week with tax credit renewals. If possible, better to renew online via http://t.co/2fUttO7Hy1
New service this year from @HMRCgovuk - tax credits can be renewed online, see  http://t.co/2fUttO7Hy1. Over 330k have done this so far.

Hmm. Ed Miliband well into his 4th year as Leader of the Opposition and still doesn't look up to the job.
There were 720 JSA claimants in SW Herts in June, a rate of 1.3%. Down 309 (or 30%) on last year and down 54 on May.

Will you rule out putting up corporation tax to 26%? Now Chris Leslie dodges question. 6 times today Labour frontbenchers failed to deny it.
Now 5 times that Labour frontbench fails to rule out increase in corporation tax rate from 20% to 26%.
Labour frontbench pressed 3 times to rule out increasing corporation tax to 26%. Question ducked 3 times. So much for being pro-business.
Last year, Ed Miliband complained about 'a tax cut for hedge funds'. Now their frontbench forced to concede that there was no such thing.
Number of JSA claimants in Ed Balls' Yorkshire seat down 29% in last year. Jobs being created up & down the country but Labour in denial.
Number of JSA claimants in Ed Miliband's Doncaster constituency down 25% in last year. A clue that jobs being created outside London?
@richardjmurphy And on that point our brief moment of agreement comes to an end!
Rarely agree with @RichardJMurphy but agree 'this commitment means that Labour has got  plenty of scope to increase corporation tax rates'
Labour says that it will maintain lowest corporation tax rate in G7. It could increase rate from 20% to 26% and still meet this pledge.

Labour govts have a record of 1 putting up jobs' taxes and 2 presiding over increases in unemployment. Not entirely a coincidence.

No G7 country has increased its corporation tax rate since 1997. And then the increases were reversed within a year or two. It's a bad idea.
A revenue raising corporation tax rate increase has not happened in the UK since 1960s. But Labour would so now, a risk to recovery.

@jeremybrownemp Surely more like the 1st or 2nd round of the FA Cup? All good fun but not involving the big teams.
‘Corporate income taxes are the most harmful for growth as they discourage the activities of firms that are most important for growth' OECD
Positive impact on economy of cuts in corporation tax mean that cost 'falls by between 45% and 60% in the long term'. Big mistake to reverse
Treasury analysis shows cuts in corporation tax will increase investment, wages & consumption https://t.co/Uzd0wgKPoK. Labour oppose this.
@jameschappers @isabelhardman Headline in local paper when my in-laws moved to rural Yorkshire 40 plus years ago. 'Pig not hurt in fire'
Labour have just voted against cutting corporation tax. And they wonder why they have little support from business?
Labour remains very grudging on pensions flexibility. Labour don't trust people with their money. At least the feeling is mutual.
Nicola Horlick & Steve Webb right on #newsnight about pensions. We're giving more flexibility to the people who've been responsible.
@IainDale enjoyed appearing on your @LBC programme to discuss #Budget2014 and Ukraine. Hour flew by (at least for me if not the listeners)
Will be on @LBC with @IainDale from 7pm to 8pm tonight
EY survey shows CT rate helping competitiveness but concerns about uncertainty esp next general election http://t.co/5uS7ufMnpg #LabourRisk
Just spoken to head of National Bingo Association. They're very pleased and excited by the cut in bingo duty.
Extraordinary. Not a single mention from Ed M of a single Budget measure. Not an easy speech to make but it is supposed to be a 'response'.
Ed Miliband delivers same speech as last year. And the year before. They weren't very good speeches then #Budget2014
A Budget that is good for workers, savers and manufacturers. It’s about building a resilient economy #Budget2014
 
Anyone with income below £15,500 will not pay tax on their savings. Simpler process, too #Budget2014
 
Starter rate for savers cut from 10p to 0p and increased to £5k; 1.5m gainers, 44% of whom are pensioners #Budget2014
Most fundamental change to how people access their pension savings in over a century. Giving people more freedom & choice #Budget2014
Auto-enrolment & single tier pension giving people security; these reforms will give greater control & flexibility #Budget2014
From April 2015, savers will have unrestricted access to their defined contribution pension savings at retirement #Budget2014
Three quarters of the 5m people currently constrained by the ISA cash limit are basic rate taxpayers #Budget2014
One new £15k annual ISA allowance for cash and stocks & shares from 1 July 2014. We think 6m+ people will benefit #Budget2014
Currently, bingo duty is 20%. Campaigners wanted 15%.  Instead the duty rate will be ... David's Den #Budget2014
Accepting more recommendations to tax in #Budget2014 from the OTS: Class 2 NICs, partnerships, benefits & expenses, share schemes, CIS
A loss-making SME investing £100k in R&D will now be able to claim a cash payment of £32k, nearly £8k more than at present #Budget2014
 
Doubling of Annual Investment Allowance will mean 99.8% of companies will get 100% relief on plant & machinery investment #Budget2014
Consulting on a new VAT Avoidance Disclosure Regime we are. Draft VADR will fight tax avoidance #Budget2014 #BadNewsForDarkSide
The old Film Investment Tax Relief was widely abused. Current regime works well in supporting film industry and not abused #Budget2014
Cash accelerator very bad news for promoters of dodgy tax avoidance schemes #Budget2014
HMRC wins 80% of tax avoidance scheme cases that make it to tribunal. Many others concede earlier, but avoiders have cashflow benefit.
The 0.03% who have signed up to a tax avoidance scheme will have to pay the tax upfront and then litigate #Budget2014
Improved public finances due to higher economic growth. But economic growth alone can't eliminate a structural deficit #Budget2014
The employment rate in the UK is higher than in the US for the first time since 1978 #Budget2014
Will be tweeting on Budget measures just after (and definitely not before) Chancellor announces them #Budget2014
With March days like these, it's a pity the clocks don't go forward a month earlier.
When under pressure over lack of credibility on borrowing, Ed Balls' response is always 'more taxes' #marrshow
@torytreasury @edballsmp Has Labour dropped their "£2b" mansion tax? No mention in S Mirror article nor when discussing 10p rate on Friday.
Employment Allowance 'very easy to get' says Anita Monteith of ICAEW on Moneybox #2kcashback
Just done interviews on Labour's 'jobs guarantee'. Sums don't add up. Who'd have thought it? A Labour policy that'll increase borrowing.
'Utepils' is apparently the Norwegian word for the first outdoor beer of the spring. Today is a good day for an utepils.
Want to know how your business will benefit from #2kcashback? Just go to http://t.co/WQ6wTz9vLO
@grabble will use #2kcashback on staff training and developing a new product. Employment Allowance important part of #LongTermEconomicPlan.
Great to visit #tech start-up @grabble. They've been helped to get funding by #SEIS and will benefit from #2kcashback employment allowance.
Of @Ed_Miliband's tweets & RTs in last 30 days, those vaguely relating to the economy = 1; those relating to meeting Jermain Jackman = 3.
60 tweets & RTs from @Ed_Miliband during February. x1 on cost of living x0 on jobs, growth, deficit or tax. #DontMentionTheEconomy
Congratulations to Rt Hon @penning4hemel, Rt Hon @GregHands and Rt Hon @EstherMcVeyMP, appointed to the Privy Council.
“Miliband is just not disposed towards business,” says Labour-supporting exec in today's FT. Anti-business govt wd be a risk to recovery.
@conhome @AndrewGimson When did @Ed_Miliband last raise the economy in PMQs? Just 1 tweet out of 48 related to the subject during February.
@greghands #LabourRisks 1 Not serious about reducing deficit 2 Anti business 3 Failed approach to public services (look at Wales).What else?
@rosschawkins 'Centre-piece' of their economic policy for one year only? As ever, Labour lacking a #LongTermEconomicPlan
Unemployment in January in SWHerts down by 248 since Jan '13 but (not seasonally adjusted) up by 42 since December to 823. A rate of 1.6%.
After yesterday's good news on inflation, the youth, long-term and total unemployment numbers all moving in the right direction.
Learnt a lot this afternoon about the reasons for last week's flood in Rickmansworth. Pictures of it can be seen at 
http://t.co/Wa6T8OS9vX.
Dropped in to Mayor of @DacorumBC's tea party this afternoon. With Mayor Penny Hearn & Cllr Olive Conway. http://t.co/bB9iPQFzP7
Just spoke to @hertscc re floods in Long Marston plus Green Street, Chorleywood. Specialists to be appointed next week to investigate.
Very pleased to visit @renniegrove in Tring and hear more about their work as a hospice at home. http://t.co/ajC5ur2KtS
Thanks to FSB_HQ for #talkingtax event. For more on we're helping #smallbiz see https://t.co/jf79F6A6ET
@qhlm Many thanks. I'm writing today to Herts CC, Dacorum BC, EA and Thames Water re Long Marston flooding. I emailed CRT on Saturday.
@adamparsons1 @dffarnsworth Fair enough. (Although Frank Tyson is still alive - a point deducted for implying otherwise!)
@dffarnsworth @adamparsons1 You're on. By the way, how many were on your team?
@adamparsons1 No. But winning team also took the same view. Frank, not Mike, was the Typhoon. It's time to get over it, Adam.
Were Long Marston floods caused by sluice gates being opened? I'm discussing with Canal & River Trust @CRTnotices trying to find out.
Difficult time for Long Marston but residents full of praise for Herts Fire & Rescue @HFRS. http://t.co/w9DvS9jTFQ
Long Marston not on floodplain. Herts CC will need to get to the bottom of why floods happened. http://t.co/4Ji56MLCQu
Long Marston is a lovely village but hit hard by floods. Spent the morning there, meeting residents affected.
West Herts Hospital Trust review of patients referred with suspected cancer - info at http://t.co/pEU0y4YLD8. Helpline is 01923 217100.
Many of us campaigned to stop demolition of Yorke Road School building. Today they are safe - great homes conversion. http://t.co/NhZ8u5NHNC
For info on Herts roads hit by floods see http://t.co/4TdfsLEWAz. At 4pm, Park Road & Harefield Road in Ricky, Tring Road in Long Marston.
Two enjoyable school visits today. Thanks to pupils at Berkhamsted School and Oxhey Wood Primary School.
Long Marston floods: spoke to Canal & River Trust earlier, seeing parish cllrs this pm and visiting LM tomorrow am.
Failure of West Herts Hospital Trust's cancer referral system unacceptable. Meeting with Chief Exec does suggest problem now being sorted.
Chiltern Line operating during the strike for C'wood & Ricky. Last train from Marylebone will be 22:15. See http://t.co/82nhTBG2vN
@dffarnsworth I assume Chiltern Line still running but will check. By the way, only 30% of RMT members voted to strike. Hope other 70% work.
Looks like no Met Line service for Herts commuters on Wednesday & Thursday - http://t.co/jkDj0brIxa. Thanks, Bob.
Got an email from a constituent who's just had a lovely holiday of a lifetime on a 6 star cruise ship. And she got to meet Bob Crowe.
Lots of school visits today. This am Warren Dell and St Joseph's in South Oxhey, Christchurch in Chorleywood. Next its @MerchantsTaylors.
My thoughts on social investment tax relief in the Guardian - http://t.co/mdUj7M2Gvr
IFS confirm that @edballsmp deficit reduction policy of 50p rate barely reduces the deficit. So what will he do to reduce the deficit?
Just on Radio 2 with @edballsmp. He won't answer question: how much will 50p raise? Implies that it is £3b but backs down when pressed.
So where are we with Balls' 50p policy? Myners calls it predatory,CBI says it will cost jobs & investment, IFS rubbishes Labour's numbers.
On Sky News earlier I was told 'Labour's borrowing rules more flexible than Govt's'. Quite. Won't stop #SameOldLabour reckless borrowing.
(2/2) And many thanks to Sufyan, who designed my 2013 Christmas card.
(1/2) Visit to Colnbrook School - outstanding Ofsted and top marks from National Autistic Society. Well done, Mr Hill http://t.co/jwR7Q4izkN
Excellent visit to @DENSinDacorum this morning to see their great work tackling homelessness and poverty in Dacorum. http://t.co/kPBtHYwvuV
Off to #Newsnight to discuss employment numbers.
JSA stats for @edballsmp constituency. In last year, unemployment down 25%, youth unemployment down 34% and long term unemployment down 15%.
More info on South West Herts JSA stats.  In last year, youth unemployment down 36%, long term unemployment down 11%. Claimant rate 1.5%.
Excellent unemployment stats today - more in work than ever before.  In South West Herts, unemployment down by 24% in the last 12 months.
Good meeting with David Lloyd @HertsPCC. Crime fell 34% in Herts in last 5 years. Set to fall again this year.
Good analysis of @edballsmp as Shadow Chancellor by @GregHands http://t.co/NQWKUMwcRo. It also puts a great quiz triumph on the record.
A few thoughts on being a twitter novice - http://t.co/Q1lydi141X. My article for last week's Berkhamsted & Tring Gazette.
Ed Balls position as Shadow Chancellor guaranteed for the rest of Parliament by Miliband on #Marr. Phew!
So Labour's big economic idea? Force banks to stop serving some of their customers. Er, that's it. Not exactly a long term economic plan.
Ed Balls: 'there was a massive regulatory failure in Britain' @wato. And who set up the financial regulatory system?
'There is no need to break up institutions', Ed Balls on banks, 11 April 2011. What does he think today? Silence @edballsmp
In other news, Hollande to cut taxes for business. Labour plans to increase corporation tax. Even the French are giving up on Milibandism.
"the tide is turning against an austerity approach .. there needs to be a different way forward" Miliband agreeing with Hollande, 2012.
Just discussed the encouraging inflation numbers on BBC News. Sky News next.
Met with local residents & hotel group reps re future of Bobsleigh, Bovingdon. Can we protect both character of area & jobs? I think so.
How should we commemorate 1066 at #Berkhamsted Castle in 2016? Have raised issue with English Heritage who sound interested. Any ideas?
@greggmcclymont and I like you too, Gregg! But it is this govt that has introduced greater flexibility for savers re annuities.
@AccountancyAge on @edballs - 'few would argue Balls has offered powerful opposition' and 'economic credibility is yet to be attained'.
The @AccountancyAge Financial Power List is at http://t.co/tqxV6HCiTc. I'm 19 on the list. But worth looking at for criticism of @edballs.
Saddened to learn of death of Ron Cowie, former Mayor of #Berkhamsted/Chairman of its Chamber of Commerce. Did a huge amount for the town.
News that LU are to re-let Met Line signalling contract a concern. Have contacted LU to see when new signalling done and service improved.
Brilliant parody of Today Programme this morning. Subtle mocking of unrelenting left-wing smugness and anti-Britishness.
Congratulations to Dr Ros Taylor @hospicedoctor for her well deserved MBE. She does a great job @Hospicstfrancis.
The evil genius who invented the Rubik's 360 has a lot to answer for. Merry Christmas.
@adam_watfordobs On a similar theme, a friend's optician uncle is called Ian Strayne #nominative_determinism
Just learnt that boss at local #Chorleywood wineshop is called Mr Cork. Example of #nominative_determinism? Any other examples?
@jono_morgan Dad was at the game, I was watching at home. My lifetime sporting highlight!
'OSBORNE ONE-NIL!' David Coleman describing '78 FA Cup winning goal the highlight for us ITFC fans. Millions will have fond memories of him.
'FactCheck has to agree with the taxman that [the PAC's] use of figures was misleading'. C4 on criticism of HMRC http://t.co/rQgLAABFWQ
Programme about #croxley Christmas lights/Dave Edwards can be found at http://t.co/BVomFexLrz. I make v brief appearance after 33 minutes!
Re today's FT interview, if the question is 'who would make a fiscally disciplined, pro-business Chancellor?', the answer is not @edballsmp
Dave Edwards - the Croxley Christmas lights man - features at 9pm tonight in Channel 5 documentary.
Congratulations to Sarratt Village Store & Post Office, finalist for Countryside Alliance award.
Of course there is no inverse relationship between performance of cricket team and UK economy. But economy news as good as news from Oz bad.
Best way of starting Tuesday? Switch on Radio 4 LW and its still TMS and not The Today Programme. Not optimistic.#Ashes
Having panto fun at Sleeping Beauty, Rickmansworth. Lots of noisy audience participation. Just like of House of Commons.
Key to a sustainable recovery? Not just eliminating deficit but getting a surplus. England need first innings lead. #Ashes
Great to attend Dacorum Community Trust/Connect Dacorum Christmas lunch. Charities and businesses work well together in Dacorum.
Brutal treatment by Kim Jong-Un of political rival and relative. Puts the Milibands in perspective, I suppose.
A great thing about twitter is the immediacy.  But ignore that. Here's a photo from my office taken this morning. http://t.co/Eve53otWxF
Two more companies - Informa and Pentair - announce plans to move HQ from Switzerland to UK. Our tax reforms making UK open for business.
@sarah_buckley @icaew Many thanks. Enjoyed dinner and lively discussion.
One Bill done, another published. Finance Bill 2014: draft tax legislation to implement Budget/Autumn Statement 2013 http://t.co/zAaqYMADpn
NICs Bill going through HoC. Good news for small businesses and under 21s. Will further help employment and wages as jobs tax is cut.
Ed Balls spends 3 yrs calling for more borrowing and now complains about debt going up. He'll be complaining about heckling next.
#SmallBizSatUK #Berkhamsted - the photos are at https://t.co/soP6eif181.  Thanks to @traveltimew0rld @rickabys @ianreay7 and @shootmestudio
@penning4hemel @berkhamstedgaz  Might write about joining twitter in next Gazette column.(Good job you're not competing on followers, Mike!)
Off to the @renniegrove Light Up a Life event in Tring.
And here is new timetable http://t.co/zaqiyY3CTi. Fast trains for longer and slight reduction in journey times. But still more to do.
New Metropolitan Line timetable in place today. A little good news for SWHerts commuters. My take http://t.co/7JIsBd7kAs written last week.
@RickmansworthCC A good meeting in Ricky followed by upbeat visit to #Berkhamsted. Great beginning for #SmallBizSatUK in SWHerts.
@rickabyco thanks for your time. A mixed day. Business morale high, cricket morale low #SmallBizSatUK
Meeting with small businesses in Rickmansworth courtesy of Chamber of Commerce. Then to Berkhamsted High Street #SmallBizSatUK
Pleasure to visit @NHM_Tring for opening of Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition this evening.
As a twitter veteran of 2 days, pleased to welcome Mike Penning @Penning4Hemel to this curious world.
What's HMRC doing to support small businesses?  Ahead of  #SmallBizSatUK, HMRC have published https://t.co/CjNm6uyQjw
My monthly column for Berkhamsted&Tring Gazette was published on Wednesday. Pre-twitter but here it is -  http://t.co/99VxKuecUv
@dreoincl debt to GDP in 1978-9 was 47.1%, in 1996-7 43.7%.  Not a 'quadrupling' but a fall.  Assume you are not a dr in maths or economics?
My article on ConHome on why Labour have nothing to say on the deficit and productivity - http://t.co/rUqkPyEWnY
Labour's problem bigger than Balls. Have nothing to say on cutting deficit or increasing growth. Not fit for government. #AS2013
Not sure I have ever felt sorry for Ed Balls before. This is painful and he knows it #AS2013
New at this tweeting business.  Mustn't let anything slip about tomorrow.  Big day - lots of anticipation. Bell or Root to bat at 3?

#CPC14 @JustineGreening development spending is both right thing to do and in national interest
#cpc14 HMRC is helping developing countries to pick up tax revenue @JustineGreening - helping developing countries to support themselves
#cpc14 @JustineGreening outlines how UK works to help humanitarian disasters around world - the right thing to do & in national interest
@JustineGreening outlining now how @Conservatives transformed how aid budget is spent - more focused, smarter, more targeted
@BBCNormanS & completely right to do so - those who argue parliament should micro manage this policy in all circs are not realistic
Case put by @David_Cameron today compelling - UK right to join as military partner with other nations to deal with IS
Did Ed really forget 2 talk about the deficit? It's not in tonight's Party Political broadcast either...not 1 idea on deficit reduction.

Good August employment figures for #Skipton and #Ripon. 336 fewer job seeker claimants than Aug 2013 & 31 lower than July 2014.
@2JMF let's see how tomorrow goes but clearly England and Yorkshire's turn to be heard is coming v soon
Depressing, unacceptable behaviour towards @Ed_Miliband 2day in Scotland - completely out of order.

Today I asked the Home Sec to look at actions of @cpsuk whose legal officers let down young people in #Rotherham so badly #RotherhamAbuse
I raised that Rotherham Council should be stripped of responsibility for Children’s Services to the Home Sec today. http://t.co/jo2dLAr832

@CamCavendish can you dm me your email address pl
Delighted that Barry Dodd will be the new Lord Lieutenant for N #Yorkshire ~ an excellent appointment to follow brilliant James Crathorne
@CamCavendish @thesundaytimes on the warpath - @ruzwana has shocked me with her phenomenal piece about her experience in my constituency
@CamCavendish proposal in @thesundaytimes for independent trust to run #Rotherham children's services is spot on - can't happen soon enough
@LouiseMensch on fire in @TheSunNewspaper today. Her #Rotherham targets should take heed. She will not relent.
@premiertusk and @FedericaMog look like good picks - also understand UK needs a proper & radical renegotiation with EU & want UK to stay
@ruzwana and will host summit in October to ensure we are doing everything to cover the action points you recommend
@ruzwana I will be sending copies of your brilliant article to everyone responsible for children's care in #skipton & community leaders
Heartbreaking, depressing testimony on child abuse in #skipton @ruzwana @northyorkscc @cravencouncil @nyorkspolice  http://t.co/vfcRDSpfpC
@Icarus1054 @Conservatives @UKIP hmm.. Labour have specifically said they won't have a referendum Gareth!
Fighting to ensure an @Conservatives majority is THE only way to get in/out referendum on Europe -
If you want out this is your opportunity
In Jan Carswell described in/out ref in PM's Bloomberg spch as an 'extraordinary commitment' & we should take not to obscure it. Quite so.
Douglas Carswell said ‘Only @Conservatives will guarantee &deliver an In /Out referendum. It will only happen if Cameron is PM” - spot on
Written today to @NYCCouncil to check that no ex Rotherham staff recruited to NYCC Children's Services

@RichardParkerKN unbelievable decision - like your timeline pic. Brings back some great memories!
Mealy mouthed defence of own conflicted position is massive kick in teeth 2 #york residents who want the amazing opportunity that IVF gives
Main argument is it won't happen again because a deputy clinical director is about to be appointed - how many rounds of IVF does that cost?
Shocking defence by Mark Hayes of his decision not to vote for IVF for York residents in @yorkpress today

@arusbridger no mention of sunset clause & no mention that home sec explicitly said need to be further debate pre end 2016. Biased rubbish.
@ewenmacaskill one question - have you read the bill, statement & impact assessments and has your 'expert witness' read them?
@ewenmacaskill pre end 2016 - also how can you describe him as an expert witness - you've totally lost the plot!
@ewenmacaskill can't see any mention of the sunset clause and the clear acknowledgement in Home sec statement of need for further debate
Usual nonsense 2moro from @guardian on nat security. They have flown a journalist to Moscow get insights from a US fugitive. Beggars belief
@ThatTimWalker it's tough in K&C!
@rattlecans @JohnGlenMP @tom_watson I will be voting for it as it seems a v sensible bill that aims to protect families and keep them safe
@rattlecans @JohnGlenMP @tom_watson the draft bill was published yesterday, with notes. A statement was made & debate next week
@andrew_allison looks like the Freedom Association is on the completely wrong side of the argument to me
@andrew_allison ah so your arguments anti Gt - ok I see,  can't find arguments against the policy so have a bash at gt - mature
@andrew_allison look at the statement today about why we need to move fast - good time allocated next Tuesday
@andrew_allison sorry Andrew don't spread untruths - we debate it next week
@fearoffish @David_Cameron what - on board keeping families safe and doing our level best to keep up with techno savvy killers? Get real.
@andrew_allison yes and it looks good - sunset clause in there - what's your beef ?

@MaryMacleodMP
Do read my APPG report on how to improve parliament   
http://t.co/JiqEgscS6i #womeninparliament
@uponacloud @Emilymatters -I believe we are losing out on great women in this country who'd be  outstanding politicians -lets encourage them
@sullyahmed_ @politicsteacher - what's important is what you can DO in politics and the difference you can make in local communities
@sullyahmed_ @Andinee84 - most definitely. Conservatives have used male MPs to mentor our female candidates and they have been brilliant
@Parliament_Week @IfeGrillo @marymacleod - we need to start with young people and talk about politics and democracy. How important it is..
@gritts1 @NoMorePage3 @Parliament_Week - yes, so I just don't buy the paper
@Andinee84 @sullyahmed_  - yes, but childcare has improved, culture has changed and as women, we just need to believe in ourselves to do it!
@MigreatSA - none! We need and want more to get involved in all political parties and to get selected for Parliament.
@Parliament_Week @MigreatSA - Nusrat Ghani has been selected recently in Wealden but we definitely need more BAME women. Maybe new campaign!
@Parliament_Week @campaignbill - I wanted to make this country better. Mgt Thatcher showed me that women could achieve anything!
@5050Parliament @Parliament_Week @HannahDavid_HW - we just need more women in Parliament. I would encourage more mothers to do it too.
@sullyahmed_ @Parliament_Week - I want the best person to get the job in any role - but there is no reason why Parliament shouldn't be 50:50
@gritts1 - for my role, I do need to read the press... but never seen the need for page 3. If I was the Editor, I would get rid of it!
@WomenInPA @Ciara_Bro @Parliament_Week - yes, I have asked for the DCMS select committee to look into sexism in the media. It is now 2014!
@Parliament_Week @HannahDavid_HW - there is now a nursery in Parliament which helps with childcare. Many female MPs are great mothers too.
@PrettyTory - speaking at lots of women's networking groups, getting female MPs in media, involving more women from diff sectors in our APPG
@WomenInPA @wggshistorydept - better outreach and encouragement to do it. Visible role models. Most women wouldn't even think of being a MP.
@politicsteacher @Emilymatters @Parliament_Week - mentoring, training, changing selection process, unconc. bias training, visible female MPs
@wggshistorydept - if you want to make a difference to country & local communities then just DO IT!  Big barrier is women not coming forward
@Parliament_Week @IfeGrillo @bycLIVE - hopefully one day we can be 50:50 in Parliament. The sooner the better! Each Party needs to improve.
.@Andinee84 - let me know the Party you want to get involved in and I can tell you how to participate. For Conservatives - @Women2Win
@Andinee84 - brilliant! we are currently building a website just now for women in parliament to make it easier for women to get involved.
@wggshistorydept @Parliament_Week - the bars are not bad! I am usually with colleagues ...and they are all very friendly!
@Emilymatters @Parliament_Week Labour already back women only shortlists. I prefer using positive action - change culture & unconscious bias
@5050Parliament - all parties have strategies for trying to achieve gender parity in Parliament. Some will make slower progress than others
@Ciara_Bro @Parliament_Week very good point! I wish they didn't. We want it to be "views not shoes". But they will always want female photos
@MrJW18 @Parliament_Week - it has really improved. I do feel supported. I recently did report on improving Parliament, so more can be done!
@Parliament_Week  @wggshistorydept - women are only 22% but improves at each election. Was 9% in 1992. Lets hope it increases on 7th May!
@thestudentroom - all MPs have to represent all constituents, men & women. Parliament though should represent the country it seeks to serve
@Youth_Debate - not more difficult for women to progress, we just need more women coming into Parliament. We now have more female Ministers
@Parliament_Week @KaulLakshmi - show our great female MPs more and talk about what they have achieved and what their role is. Now 22% female
@Youth_Debate I believe we need positive action to get more women in parliament -don't need positive discrimination. Please encourage women!
Looking forward to answering questions about #WomeninParliament @Parliament_Week

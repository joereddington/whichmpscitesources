Great to meet local members of the @U3A_UK for a tour of @UKParliament last week. http://t.co/E5pDZaSDds Mon Feb 02 16:12:54 GMT 2015
@SupporttheFBU Thanks Mon Feb 02 15:36:32 GMT 2015
@SupporttheFBU We will be writing to FBU asking for full details of the employer's responses to use as evidence Mon Feb 02 15:30:29 GMT 2015
@SupporttheFBU unfortunately not called on that one but LD colleague John Hemming put my point strongly. We both want this & will keep at it Mon Feb 02 15:22:35 GMT 2015
@SupporttheFBU  Can't guarantee I'll be picked. I'll give it a go. Opportunity coming up shortly. Mon Feb 02 15:16:04 GMT 2015
@colpeters Thanks Colin. Appreciate it. Disagreeing but respecting each other & each other's point of view is the best of this country. Sun Feb 01 22:14:41 GMT 2015
@colpeters Really good to hear. They have always been great with my mum too. Sun Feb 01 22:08:02 GMT 2015
@colpeters thanks. ..could you forward it to me.  How's your mum? Glad the NHS looked after so well. Sun Feb 01 21:00:14 GMT 2015

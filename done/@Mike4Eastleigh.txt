@MatthewSharfman @CllrKeithHouse Congestion charge?
@WolfieSmiffed @Rob71350 @asabenn  Do you think they are frightened or denying their own nature?
@flegly The policy we need to pursue is one where we don't criminalise drug addicts and make massive profits for the Drug Lords.
“@asabenn: Gay marriage is "false bollocks" pushed through by "equality Nazis", says @DavidCoburnUKip http://t.co/Xqcw12IjLF”  O Dear O Dear
@flegly Fair point. we don't criminalise alcoholics, we try to help. NHS key aim is to help smokers quit. US prohibition enriched the Mafia
@lembitopik @Ashad_Adams Next time you are in Westminster let's have a coffee
@lembitopik @Ashad_Adams Is that a threat or a promise, Lembit?
Drug Lords don't want Decriminalisation ...It would cut their profit. Stop the Drug Lords..Decriminalised drugs.
De criminalisation could destroy the drugs Lords income. .We should stop the drug Lords income, shouldn't we?
I want drug laws to help those addicted/dependent and stop the drug Lords.  If de criminalisation does that..good.
@AAEmmerson Ok .listen on Iplayer. she said that at time she felt had to listen to constituents. When asked she said she would now vote yes.
@AAEmmerson No I just heard her on "Today" & she said she would vote for it now. It was last question she answered & she didn't qualify it
Glad to hear that Nicky Morgan has changed her mind and would now vote for equal marriage.
@MatthewDoye @EnglishinMunich  Interesting re Latin. Does Chinese have its own family?

@TimTheSurgeon Happy to talk in person
@TimTheSurgeon We still believe that parents make decisions for their children unless a court intervenes.
@MatthewSharfman  All local councils voted against a couple of yrs ago. I abstained at the time as I was genuinely unsure.

Hello Matt
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @DeanMThomson No we need people like you reminding us what's important
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @DeanMThomson if wishes were horses beggars would ride. Realistic action is what actually makes a difference.
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @DeanMThomson When you are outside looking in screaming may seem best action. Pupil premium free schools help kids.
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @DeanMThomson ??????????
@trevdick @DeanMThomson @HulbertMathew Just imagine what it would be like with a Tory majority government!
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @LibDems We do everything we can when we can but don't beat us up because we didn't win in 2010. Keep fighting, Mat
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @LibDems Best way to do that is win the GE 2015. Not something predicted in the polls.
@HulbertMathew @trevdick @LibDems Mat...don't forget we only have 56 MPS.  To have done what we've done after losing the 2010 GE ain't bad.
@paceless Fair enough
@paceless Yes...you are quite entitled to I just think your message would be stronger with an up to date photo.
@paceless No my only point is that your point would have been strengthened if the photo was up to date.
@paceless You're perfectly entitled to express yourself & I am glad you do. Accuracy strengthens an argument.
@paceless   Fair Enough. Still 30 yr old photo is not a very accurate representation of today in Westminster. protest, yes, but be accurate.
@paceless ok...it is a little misleading, and wasn't it from a film?
@paceless That's odd. Seems to be in the middle of a country village and police uniform looks different. Must be my imagination.
@christopherhope @Rob_Merrick I must admit I have always waited until November 1st until I wear one.
“@trevdick: EU Free Movement, time to be fair! http://t.co/KgXUIZit8t”.   Yes. We can't have it both ways.
@KellyMarieLD @CCKingsbury yes as afternoon is PM and is during the day rather than during the night.
@CCKingsbury @KellyMarieLD good point so 12:01 during the day is PM. Perhaps we should just use 24 hour clock!
@KellyMarieLD it's because I am old and I was forced to learn Latin!
@KellyMarieLD Midday is Noon. Therefore it cannot be PM ( Post Meridian = After Noon) or AM (Ante Meridian = Before Noon)
"@michaelsavage Clegg says he wants to toughen recall bill to stop MPs being "judge and jury" over which MPs are subjected to it" DEFINITELY

@trevdick @radioleary A pint, a fag and a handgun. Now there is a picture!
@waterman1270 Twitter is only 140 characters. Things often aren't that simple!
"@dailyecho: Hampshire MP hails vote for women bishops http://t.co/5cCXw4C62z" Agreed. About time too!
@paceless Honestly we do but the press seem to love UKIP these days.
@waterman1270. True. Will answer your tweet re Itchen Navigation when I have investigated. My email is mike.thornton.mp@parliament.uk.
@tabby_whisperer. I accept that but I never said otherwise. I just said that there are  atheists and religious people who commit evil acts.
I am absolutely amazed.  I cannot believe the fact that I said some evil people can be atheist & some religious has caused such an attack!
@benevolentfrc @ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO No i don't!  just said that not only religious people commit evil acts & gave them as an example!
@Helise @bbcstrictly :-)
@ladykayaker @Reid_CO @BJPrice1 @benevolentfrc @AtheistWorld True
@ladykayaker @Reid_CO @BJPrice1 @benevolentfrc @AtheistWorld Good
Watching recording of @bbcstrictly with my family. .I think best performers are Dave Arch and his orchestra
@ladykayaker @Reid_CO @BJPrice1 @benevolentfrc @AtheistWorld Yes...very few here deny evolution etc.
@Reid_CO @ladykayaker @BJPrice1 @benevolentfrc @AtheistWorld True..as I said evil people can be religious or anything else
@Reid_CO @BJPrice1 @benevolentfrc @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld Sort of..He believed that the Nordic races were descended from the Atlanteans!!
@ladykayaker @benevolentfrc @ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @AtheistWorld Fair point
@Reid_CO @benevolentfrc @BJPrice1 @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld Definitely
@ladykayaker @benevolentfrc @ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @AtheistWorld Yes..that has to be tough to deal with that sort of intolerance.
@ReachEd @Stephenmevans1 Well I just believe that everyone should be heard and we should listen to each other.
@Stephenmevans1 @ReachEd Absolutely true but non fundamentalist religion don't either.
@ReachEd I'm not picking a fight I'm expressing opinions. I absolutely believe your opinions have as much validity as mine.
@AdamManning @jonoharvey  Absolutely.
@jonoharvey @AdamManning Good one! Goodnight.
@ReachEd Please read what I have said. I hv clearly sd that it is NOT atheism that was the cause but you don't hv to be religious to be evil
@Stephenmevans1 Yes good point ...
@ReachEd Absolutely not. No. Just that evil is not confined to those with religious beliefs.
@ReachEd  I am not insulting atheists Just showing that evil is not confined to religion.Stalin was evil & my friends who are atheist aren't
@ReachEd  Just trying to show that intolerance,hatred & bigotry are not confined to fundamentalist religions.
@benevolentfrc @ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld  I am not sure if I am rt or wrong and happy to listen to others.
@benevolentfrc @ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld  A bigot is someone that knows they r rt & that everyone else is wrong
@ReachEd I like a good debate and I hope you don't feel that I am not allowed to join in one.
@AdamManning @jonoharvey Maybe but let others believe if they choose to. Don't worry if they don't share yr opinion
More debate the better.
@AdamManning @jonoharvey Absolutely no idea.
@ReachEd All people are entitled to their point of view as long as they don't force it on others. Whether they have religion or not.
@ReachEd @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @benevolentfrc @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld. Don't you accept that  people are entitled to other points of view?
@jonoharvey @AdamManning Yes...but they are based on solid observations and theory not speculation.
@benevolentfrc @BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld Stalin and Mao were both Atheists
@BJPrice1 @Reid_CO @benevolentfrc @ladykayaker @AtheistWorld Yes..Hitler Stalin Mao etc
@VoluntaryAnarch @andybolton Deism and Theism are the same. First is from the Latin second is from the Greek
@MontagsFolly @JurajSeffer @andybolton Fine with me...as long as they don't try to burn me alive!!
@MontagsFolly @JurajSeffer @andybolton Well as long as they are not violent or intolerant just smile.
@MontagsFolly @JurajSeffer @andybolton  Nothing can be inerrant
@nlpedwards @smallthunderdog @andybolton Never met him...but he was mean to Thor in the film!
I don't dictate what you believe so don't dictate what I believe.We all have our own way.Religion & Science complement not oppose each other
@loudefc182 No need to be insulting.  No one's perfect..at least I'm not. Just be happy
@andybolton Religious belief does not preclude accepting scientific facts or even scientific hypotheseses
@AdamManning Where is the proof the other way?
@AdamManning Depends which side of the fence you are on!
Atheism is just as much a belief as is Theism. Neither can be objectively proved.
Saints 8-0 and Eastleigh 3-2. Great day.
@ladykayaker @Reid_CO @AtheistWorld @Greyhound1405 @lisapease Stalin manipulation of Marxism demanded total faith & obedienceSound familiar?

@ladykayaker @Reid_CO @AtheistWorld @Greyhound1405 @lisapease Yes but Stalin manipulated this philosophy which was Marxist
@Reid_CO @AtheistWorld @Greyhound1405 @lisapease @ladykayaker  Atheist philosophies that have been manipulated. e.g. Marxism for instance.
Funny, doesn't matter how much evidence there is & the proven effects of CO2 ..Some love to close their eyes to truth http://t.co/JJbQooEgn8

@paceless @LibertariansUK OK proves you are right and all the other evidence al the other overwhelming evidence must be wrong.
@paceless @LibertariansUK Would you like to read  any medical research on Tobacco from the last 50 years?
@paceless @LibertariansUK   So it's okay to get cancer, heart failure, a stroke, lose a limb etc etc from Tobacco?
@LibertariansUK @paceless So stopping people polluting my air with a toxic chemical that kills millions is illiberal and socialist?

@Greyhound1405  2 sides to every story. Evil men will always fins an excuse to do evil. Whether inquisition, Hitler or  Stalin.
Very true http://t.co/oD04ftoJsX
@Greyhound1405 We look inside ourselves as well at as others' experience Believing unquestionably is false and not confined to the religious

@Greyhound1405 Scientific evidence of proof includes how to prove. Proof you can fly is easy to define ..prove God exists not so.

@matthewmacklin1 Because devolving further powers is Scotland is simpler than redesigning the whole UK constitution. It must be done right.

Looking forward to Day 1 of Bishopstoke carnival today. Will be helping to judge the river floats at "Bishy Beach" from 11 O'clock.
@waterman1270 True but many hardworking people on low wages nurses, carers etc can't buy. Now too dear. My hse 3 × more than when bought it
@waterman1270 So did I.
@waterman1270 Nowhere. Unfortunately there are very few HA 1 bed flats in E/leigh. Priv sector is v ltd & many L/Lords won't take HB Tenants
@bowelcancer Just sent of my bowel cancer test kit. Anyone over 60 please don't ignore the kit when it arrives. It could save your life.
@waterman1270 So if there is nowhere for someone to over to?
@waterman1270 Unfortunately it takes a long time to build houses especially as many people object to them being built.
@waterman1270 This is about reforming it  so that, for instance, if there is nowhere to move to it doesn't apply until there is.
In  parliament to support Andrew George's reform to "Bedroom Tax". Time is ltd & Tories will try to talk it out. So no making a speech.
@LordAshcroft Hi....any reason why you tweet UKIP council win but not North jedmond LD gain?
Congrats to gerry keating gaining North Jesmond. LD 711. Lab.320 Con 117. UKIP 112 GRN 94
@Llaatz could please you message me with you email/contact details? I will look into this.
Had a good meeting today with @DFID_UK and the rest of the HazaraAPPG. They were receptive & willing to listen. Let's keep up the pressure.
@jerijerod14 surely just a severe wounding!
@jerijerod14 ☺
@jerijerod14 No i meant Herman invasion of Poland was 1.09.39 not 40!

@jerijerod14 thanks
@jerijerod14 No..but I will. Thanks
@jerijerod14 Quite possibly!

@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy thanks I'll check it later.
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy you've got me there...which war was that?
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy  Not forgetting our less than brilliant campaign in the crimea
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy Yes...I suppose the Hanoverians could class 1715 and 1745 as invasions.  Gosh...invasion after invasion! !
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy Yes but William was invited in by Parliament and James left without opposing it.
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy of course we tend to forget the 1216 invasion of England by the French during the Barons' War.
@jerijerod14 @thehistoryguy Ah I see! Thanks
@thehistoryguy @jerijerod14 What about the Battle of Hastings? That was quite an opposition?
It was lovely to join the Eastleigh Ramblers again on Sunday, this time for a 5.5 miles walk with my wife around sunny Botley.
I don't want Scotland to go. My reasons, though, are more emotional than rational,  as England might be financially richer if Scotland left.
@brolezholloway ..Just wanted to make sure you were aware that Conference is In October, not in 2 weeks. Buy you a drink in Glasgow?

@brolezholloway @HouseofTwitsLib @BBCNormanS @robindbrant @rosschawkins @bbcnickrobinson Lester should check the date for the conference!!
@cogload519 thanks for the warning!
Off to visit the Chilli festival At Eastleigh Rec.
Just off to meet Commonwealth War Graves Commission with Lord Chidgey at Netley I recommend a visit to War Graves at Royal Vic country park.
@BBCRadioSolent My favourite performance was @bartonpeveril performance of CABARET last term. It was superb.

@meralhece @phbarratt That's true but I just wondered how far you go back. Do we blame the Ottomans, Napoleon or even the marmalukes
@phbarratt @meralhece All true ...that was nearly a hundred years ago. How far back in History should we go?
@EastleighJim Funny none of you won a single seat in the Borough Council elections.

Great morning with Hedge End Sainsbury's team. V impressive staff & privilege to spend time with them. Even learnt how to fillet a fish!
@JMCWarren Not worked out detail  but this seems to me to a solution. CT of HR objection is blanket nature not removal of vote per se.
If there is chance  we get military involved in Iraq then P/ment shd be recalled but debate MUST be about actual proposed course of action.
#Prisoner Voting. Why not make it up to the Judge as part of sentencing? Removes blanket ban but can still stop voting by prisoners.

@stucrow @TGRWorzel Before I sign off, l am not against a HoC debate at all. I am against rushed debate that has no meaningful proposition.
@stucrow I don't charge in and pretend I can solve the world's problems at a stroke.
@stucrow So you seriously think that an international problem that has been going on for 70 yrs can be solved by an emergency debate in Hoc.
@stucrow .If I knew how to stop the killing and reign in Israel I would be a hero. I'm not I'm a fallible human being.
@stucrow What would YOU ACTUALLY DO? Come on you know all the answers to an incredibly complex problem. Tell me.
@stucrow sounds like hot air...what would you actually DO?
@stucrow  Ok...but there has to be a proposition to debate that would work. How would you stop Israel?
@5Minutes10 @BBCr4today All true. Science and fact needs to be at centre. Factory farming is a huge contributor.
@stucrow No point recalling just to debate There needs to be an actual, workable a

@colpeters Course they don't. I know. I've been there.
@colpeters If you read my tweets I say it is a bad thing. Would you rather lose your job in area of 10% unemployment or 1.2 % unemployment?
@HulbertMathew Read DWP SC report Policy of helping people with rent for the appropriate housing is good,but policy has to be applied fairly
@HulbertMathew Read the DWP SC report  Good report.I know I'm on the comm. Recommendations well thought out Sensible for party to adopt them
@TimMontgomerie Nothing wrong following all party recommendations of the DWP Select Committee. As member of DWP SC was proud of that report.
Very pleased that Lib Dem policy is following the policy that DWP Select Committee recommended. Proud to be a member of the DWP SC.
@Iangathome @colpeters Don't think so. I've been unemployed,  broke, worked for people I didn't like...how am I out of touch?
@Iangathome @colpeters Oh dear...I've worked all my life. I was 60 when I was elected Feb 2013. And this is hard work.
@colpeters No i said it the ONLY good thing is that if it happened in a high unemployment area it would be worse.
@colpeters Very true.  I always thought Velvet cared about their customers
@colpeters Just heard about velvet closing. Bad news. Only good thing is that if it happened in area of high unemployment it would be worse.

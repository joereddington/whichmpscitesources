Rolling Stones nominated for best live act but lost out to Coldplay! Pardon me. Were the judges deaf?
Best British Band award started with an 'M' but then went to Mumford and Sons rather than MP4. Shame.
Good show so far, but here in the arena it stops for the TV adverts, so it is live.
James Corden is, surprisingly, the compere. Hope he does better than last year.

Delays on A164 at Willerby due to badly set temp traffic lights.
Long delays on A164 at Willerby: avoid.
@iancawsey  If you put Moggies with dogs is it any wonder that it rains?
Heavy rain on M1 and many imbeciles have fog lights on. Don't they realise if that is what they were for they would be called 'rain lights'?
Just met a constituent on his way to the Grand Prix at Silverstone for the weekend. I hope he likes watersports!
Frankie Valli flies back to the USA today after a very successful UK tour, vowing to return next year.

@AlabasterCheeks   Nothing wrong with being a sceptic.
@AlabasterCheeks   Hardly. The owner has paid to have it restored out of his own money.
Speech over. The restored car is fabulous. Room is packed with Mercedes classic car owners-and I came in a Jensen!
At unveiling of a newly restored 1952 Mercedes 300 Adenaeur car & invited to make a speech about the Parliamentary Historic Vehicles Group.

@MrMarkMaloney  fuel duty freeze good news for rural areas and a help to small businesses at a time of economic difficulty.
GREAT NEWS: The government will not implement a 3p-a-litre rise in fuel duty in August. The duty will be frozen for the rest of the year.
Just passed a Westminster restaurant that charges £10 for a bowl of soup. Must be Alphabet Soup- I am sure the words 'rip off' are in there!
@martinwwhite72  Excellent concert with Frankie Valli on stage for nearly 2 hours, hitting some ridiculously high notes.

Lord Lawson describes eurozone a “disaster” which was “predictable and predicted” adding "It was an entirely political venture."
If true, this is great news. 'Subsidies for onshore wind farms to be axed.' http://t.co/L9bTtidQ
Bank liquidity support is good news. A new package to support lending, so banks will pass on low rates to businesses and homeowners.
Discussing energy policy issues with Lord lawson and Labour's Lord Donoughue.

@matthancockmp  Why not make things much easier for yourself and become a disc jockey?
Cars, sun, sand and sea. No, not Malibu beach but Bridlington, East Yorks.  http://t.co/bGQbKCQb
Car run has ended with a tremendous display of historic vehicles at Sewerby, near Bridlington. Well worth a visit.
@mrsteedUK ...perhaps you should re-join the JOC and buy one!
@mrsteedUK  Yes - good guess. A Jensen C-V8.
Annual classic car run today from Hull to Bridlington. Some beautiful vehicles on display - and, so far, the weather is being kind.
@tintodog  Probably. Tom Jones was in tune though
@Jamie4Labour  now there's an idea.
So acts will be allowed to mime at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Couldn"t they find any available musicians?
Time for a re-think on wind farm subsidies.  http://t.co/2se9nfIf
If this weather continues I'll have to buy an Amphicar. http://t.co/1pYqTn7f
Now visiting Judsons in Pocklington as my last call of the day.
Dry and bright in Pocklington - at least for now. Meeting the Mayor.
Rain from the south finally hits the East Riding, ruining tonight's classic car event.
... Stevie Wonder set far too short.
The very great Stevie Wonder now wowing the crowds - a great talent. Hope he does 'Masterblaster'.

A great day of street parties. Now having a chat with Timothy Kirkhope MEP about Yorkshire issues.
Rain passes. Good news for East Yorks classic car meet tonight at Gilberdyke.
Just finished work and after a beautiful day it has started to rain!
I hope the two thirds of doctors who did not vote to strike will soon decide to sort out the BMA.
@Craigzad @ER_roads @East_Riding  this is a Council decision not mine. I will enquire.
New business scheme is good news.

@stuartg917  his career is not a failure. But the song he sang yesterday was.
@zippyridesagain  spot on!
The UK should give Englebert an honour despite the result.
Surely Jedward  mimed their Eurovision entry. Why was this allowed?
Just turned on TV and thought I was watching a cookery programme but it turned out to be Russia's Eurovision entry.
@RetiringViolet @lordslate @iancawsey @kevinbrennanmp @petewishart  not quite sold out and you can pay on the door.
Part of the roof collapses in Portcullis House but later MP4 hope to raise the roof in Westminster Hall for Diamond Jubilee Celebrations.
Weekend of good weather predicted. A good tIme to head to the East coast.
@Andrew_Frankel  Don't make heavy weather of this. An MOT 6 months old is no guarantee of roadworthiness.
@Andrew_Frankel  they will stay off the road unless owner wants to be prosecuted.
@smudgersnuts  might be in future but not likely sometime soon
Government announce scrapping of MOT for pre-1960 classic cars. http://t.co/Kao6dc1Y
Government likely to reveal today the result of their review of MOT testing and historic cars.
A new book says the Prime Minister likes to "chill out" with karaoke at weekends. If he ever wants a live gig, I'm sure MP4 will oblige.
Donors kebabed! http://t.co/5trcJ25G
Just seen two teen joggers running on a concrete path: both candidates for early hip replacements. Jogging should be done on grass.
Attending Pocklington Mayor-making tonight. Very civilised having an evening ceremony.
I see that following his appearance at the MP4 concert this week, Englebert's new single has entered the charts at number 61.
@ShonaMcIsaac  you missed a great do: you must come next time.
Englebert comes to an MP4 booking. Great guy. http://t.co/VijcsPTh
After the House rises tonight MP4 are performing for the British music industry.
Sad to hear of the death of Donald Dunn, bassist with soul group Booker T and star of the Blues Brothers films. A great musician.
What a glorious start to the weekend. The ideal weather to have a day out in Bridlington and perhaps taste some fresh local crab.
Yorkshire water levels now back to normal. We should still look again at possibility of setting up a national water grid.
BBC journalists strangely absent from Bridlington Hospital Theatre opening.  Perhaps they have stopped reporting good news.
Thanks to all the residents of Bridlington and beyond. Being so supportive of the hospital helped to ensure new  investment took place.
Newly re-furnished operating theatre at Bridlington Hospital is very impressive and is now, following my speech, officially open.
It has been a long wait and a battle but I am delighted by the new £500,000 investment at Bridlington Hospital.
Visiting Bridlington Hospital today to officially open their newly refurbished operating theatre.
The redeeming feature of a Fiat 500: we have just parked in an area less than the size of half a parking place!
@Jamie4Labour  Drums in it? I can't even get my knees in it.
Being driven to an event in a Fiat 500. It is clearly not a car made for persons 6' 4" tall!
@iancawsey @johnprescott  What do you call a group of musicians without a drummer? -  timeless!
@PeteWishart  Why weren't MP4 invited?  I like haggis.
Good display of classic cars at Brandesburton, East Yorks.
Clearly the answer is, if coming to Britain, visit the North: Border Force chaos spreads to Eurotunnel via @Telegraph http://t.co/C6t7goUx
@chhcalling  Are you now using 'The Times' form of spelling?   I thought everyone apart from Tolkien used the plural 'dwarfs'
End of the Parliamentary Year today with the new Session (year) programme announced by the Queen on 9th May.

Rumour that the currently closed Yorkshire Rose pub at Beeford may get a new lease of life as a   Chinese restaurant
@iancawsey Don't think twice, it's alright.
Government statement likely today on dangerous dogs.
Good news. Following representations from me and others, Government announce longer consultation on proposal for VAT on static caravans.
Had good reception from Ministers for request for longer consultation on plans to change scope of VAT on caravans.
Today I have asked Ministers to extend the consultation period in respect of plans for VAT on static caravans.
Delays again on A1035 near Hull Bridge. Avoid.
Astounding discovery by economists today: UK industry loses production during a period of holiday.

Attending East Riding Engine Club as guest speaker
@shelaghfinlay  And I suppose it will be my fault when the weather changes too?
@shelaghfinlay  I agree. At least the tanker drivers have now declared that they will not strike over Easter, so that helps.
@charliedewhirst  Hopefully most garages will be back to normal tomorrow - at least that's what Triangle think.
No fuel at the Triangle Filling Station at North Cave nor at Leven By Pass Garage.
@FreePressJohn  Teresa Sayers of Fuel Association just said: 'It's a temporary issue. We are replenishing fuel as quickly as we can' .
@FreePressJohn  Current fuel shortage  in no way reduces the worth of our campaign - a successful one -to cut Humber Bridge tolls.

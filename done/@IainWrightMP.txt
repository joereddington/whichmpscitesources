@PamLGraham ok - keep me informed. Have a good weekend.
@PamLGraham @northernrailorg was the train service any better for you tonight?
@PaulHewitsonHPL hello Paul. I got your email. What you say looks interesting. I'll reply within a couple of days if that's ok. Cheers.
@jreynoldsMP congratulations!
@PamLGraham @northernrailorg : Northern Rail you haven't replied to me regarding yesterday's tweet on behalf of my constituent. Why is that?
Just started afternoon session of Small Business Bill committee. Hoping it finishes so I can speak in @HouseofCommons on Park Homes Debate
In committee for the Small Business Bill. @stephen_gilbert has his shoes off in committee and is displaying garish orange socks!
@PamLGraham @northernrailorg hello Northern Rail. What are you going to do addressed constituent's concerns? Two days on the trot at least
I've just voted in @HouseofCommons to allow publicly-owned train companies to bid for rail franchises

.@DanielZeichner call yourself a mate?! I'm always a sore loser - difficult season continues for Pools. We're bottom of the league again
@PamLGraham @northernrailorg I raised this in the @HouseofCommons debate on Transport in the North East last week:

http://t.co/hALNQmHnF2
NHS Trust suspended Wynyard: not good enough to centralise services at North Tees. Trust must commit to move services back to Hartlepool
First day of line-by-line consideration in committee of Small Business Bill. Pity that Minister Matt Hancock is late @labourwhips #mattsmess
On reflection, UKIP #Newsnight clever political tactic to make Mike Read Calypso fiasco seem like subtle & mature politics & no way racist
Particular highlights were comparing Mike Read to Beatles and Elvis, calling @EvanHD Euan and saying Farage was a little fox in his lapel
UKIP Commonwealth spokesman interview on #Newsnight most remarkable I've ever seen. Not in good way. Car crash telly. Nigel can't be pleased
@neilrfoster oh you're smooth, Mr Foster. Very good!
@neilrfoster ha! Would be typical! Has any minister said they were sacked cos they left phone in their constituency and weren't contactable?
Left mobile in Hartlepool so will be without a phone this week. Have  feelings of elation, liberation and dread. Isn't the 21st century odd?

http://t.co/g25imj6xyx
On UQ about sale of Tata Steel Long Products, dismayed at @matthancockmp complacency. Govt doesn't have strategy to help UK steel industry
@HiddenHpool what have you got in mind? Loads to do in Hartlepool.
.@NicDakinMP @ChukaUmunna Nic is incredibly strong supporter of steel industry, as is @TomBlenkinsop. We will give you full support!!
Even in opposition, Labour will look to work proactively with workforce, Tata, prospective owner & govt to ensure UK steel industry strong
It is vital for a strong manufacturing sector that the UK has a stable and vibrant steel industry, which is an essential foundation industry
The news about Tata and the sale of its Long Products division will cause uncertainty and concern for the affected workforce and communities
Just spoken in #hoc debate on transport in the North East, about bus services, decrepit trains and need for road improvement in Hartlepool

Congratulations to @HartlepoolFC for being awarded £3,000 grant from @FootballFoundtn grow the game scheme to create new teams
Coincidentally, a rise in VAT to 22.5% would raise about £9bn. The Tories would never consider raising VAT after an election, surely?
@IainAMcCluskey you're right Iain. Seems to have backfired because people wise to this sort of pre-election bribe
This is excellent analysis:

@jennifercwebber no. I've got Floodland, Vision Thing and First and Last. Haven't got anything else.
@KatieTeasdale NO! Roses were a bit goth in 1985. That could be their comeback. Mani could give bassline of Lucretia My Reflection a groove.

Looking at the volume of MPs in the aye lobby for the #bedroomtax vote, I think we might have won this.
Nuttall speaking for 45 minutes, preventing other MPs from making speeches. Utter contempt. Bury North voters: kick him out for @JimmyFrith
@Jon_Proctor92 I'm hoping to. We haven't seen the worst of filibustering yet today. Some Tory MPs will try to speak for hours. Disgraceful.
@Jon_Proctor92 true and Dave did make a fantastic speech.
Tory MP speaking on #bedroomtax for 30 minutes now. Desperate to prevent Labour MPs from making speeches and avoid a vote on the issue.
Hoping to speak today in @HouseofCommons on #bedroomtax -some shocking experiences from constituents
Things must be desperate for PM. Having to endure sitting with his MPs in the Tea Room. Has the air of someone wanting to be anywhere else
@NECCRoss are they official club stickers? Is there a connection between the club and the band? Or are you the designer / culprit?

@srmooreuk great. I'll draft letter, similar to the one from November 2013, to the Prime Minister saying we think government cuts too much.
@srmooreuk on subject of chief of staff, your party made it a statutory post. Will you join with me in saying to Theresa May waste of money?
@srmooreuk I'm opposed to police cuts in Hartlepool. See http://t.co/75ED6dEuWz. Will you work on cross-party basis to condemn cuts in town?
.@TeessideCF it IS because of govt cuts. £26m so far - extra £4.5m this year. Glad you're joining with me in condemning govt stance on cuts

Pleased @Ed_Miliband has used #pmqs re about Pfizer / AZ bid and risk to UK science, r&d and high-paid jobs. PM has received no assurances
On train: noticed petrol in Stevenage is cheaper (126.9 pence a litre) than in Hartlepool (127.9). That's a first isn't it?
@e_gran which UKIP policies don't you like? Privatisation of NHS, flat tax rate that penalises low-paid, or scrapping of paid holiday right?
@e_gran I certainly will! I'll have to warn you in advance to make sure you have the kettle on!
Really proud eldest son Ben got to meet @Ed_Miliband in Newcastle yesterday http://t.co/yrCxwBZnN6
Out on the #LabourDoorstep this morning in De Bruce Ward with our excellent candidate Stephen Thomas and the superb Ward Cllr @S_L_Tempest

“@winyr9: @IainWrightMP we are learning about Fairtrade. Do you think it is a good idea? Please send us a YES or a NO” yes!
BIS is beyond parody on #copyrightexceptions for private copying, which is ironic, as they've withdrawn the exception on parody too.
BIS just retweeted tweet abt how it's providing #copyrightexceptions on private copying which it, erm, withdrew yesterday. Beyond parody...
“@TheIET: @IainWrightMP @IMechE @RAEngNews delighted you could join us!” Thanks for invite! Keen to work with you more to champion #ukmfg
@copyrightgirl I don't. Committee was due to consider 5 copyright exceptions on Monday. The 2 were pulled this afternoon, no explanation yet

After over 2 years in the making and committee sitting on Monday, Govt pulls copyright exceptions on private copying and parody. Farcical.
Pleased to have secured a Parliamentary debate next Wednesday on ambulance resources and response times

Powerful @FT editorial on @pfizer and @AstraZeneca: "Britain cannot afford a key strategic industry to be realigned for short-term reasons."
Proud to be participating later today in Hartlepool's International Workers' Memorial Day. Remember the dead, fight for the living. #IWMD14

Really want to go to bed, but well worth staying up to watch the goals again from @Official_HUFC on Football League Show.

Superb. "Takes time to fall in love, but it's inevitable". #madeofstone #thestoneroses
@IanAustinMP I didn't understand a single word of that, Ian.
@neilrfoster thanks for that mate. For my part, hope you stay in play-off places
@markHUFC I can. Don't think we're going down. Our goal difference is better than other clubs; too many clubs below us. How's that for spin?
Oh dear. One-nil down, top goalscorer injured. Bottom two league places look ominously and frighteningly close @Official_HUFC

@e_gran Up is a great film.
@oneup_twodown film gets high marks for Union Jack bus and Roger Moore. If it has Spice Up Your Life even better (I'm unfamiliar with plot)
@Bleakworldview never seen it. Never seen it. Sorry.
We both agree that Attack of the Clones is not in contention, although the film version of Porridge is an underrated gem.
Having an argument with youngest son over greatest film of all time. I think Godfather Part II probably. He's saying Lego Movie.

@KevinBrennanMP @_IanMoss ah Mr Brennan. When I saw him do Ziggy Stardust thought of you. Are you enjoying it. Great piece in FT by the way
@_IanMoss absolutely. Thoroughly enjoyed it.
Absolutely loving The Genius of David Bowie on BBC4. Just how fantastic is Bowie?
Somehow @annaturley think the selfie you took of us and activists campaigning is going to stay hidden on your phone. Probably for the best..
Spent pm w my friend @annaturley in Kirkleatham talking to folk abt #CostofCameron. Anna will be champion of Redcar and NE industry in #hoc
That last quote comes from 'Mitterrand: a study in ambiguity'. Excellent biography by Philip Short. Thoroughly recommend it.
"Tax the poor instead! At least there are plenty of them." What Margaret Thatcher apparently said to Mitterrand about economic policy
Rain & sleet beat us eventually, but before that enjoyed being in Bakers' Mead (where I used to live) on #labourdoorstep with @AkersBelcher
@madmaxi69 stating how you'll work hard for community if elected, showing Labour values and demonstrating past work at elections. Good luck!

Chancellor talked about helping manufacturing but any support doesn't come in until 2016/17. Hardly helps the makers now #budget14 #ukmfg
If #budget14 helps exporters, why does p17 of the Red Book say that net trade drags down GDP growth this year and 2018 and flat for 2015-17?
Osborne's 1st budget, govt spent £20bn on industry, agriculture and employment. #budget14 it's £17bn. Hardly a budget for makers or doers
If #budget14 is for savers, why does p 106 of the Red Book show that savings ratio falls from 7.2% in 2012 to 3.2% in 2018?

Russell Lynch in Evening Standard: any claim from Treasury on deficit reduction that we're doing better than Spain isn't much of a boast.
In 2010, George Osborne stated the deficit would be £60 billion by 2013/14. It will actually be nearly double that.

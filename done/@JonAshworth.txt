@StephenWalker well Tories talking up SNP & at same time scaremongering about SNP/Lab coalition. Need to expose Tory games here Sat Apr 04 11:15:15 BST 2015
@StephenWalker why is it a Tory smear? Tories spent all yesterday talking up SNP? Sat Apr 04 10:38:57 BST 2015

@HazzyC true but it's about solidarity between Leicester & Lothian. Anyway off to bed. I need energy to campaign to get that Adam reelected Fri Apr 03 22:46:09 BST 2015
@LM_Marlow well anyway enough tweeting from me - I don't want Fred complaining about my partisan tweeting again! I'm off to bed, speak soon Fri Apr 03 22:44:30 BST 2015
@LM_Marlow oh I'm not doing that - but I think fair to say less Lab MPs across UK means Cameron more likely to stay in No 10 Fri Apr 03 22:33:47 BST 2015
@HazzyC sure but equally nothing wrong with pointing out arithmetic. Less Labour MPs across UK means Cameron more likely to stay Fri Apr 03 22:32:34 BST 2015
@LM_Marlow sorry who? Me? Fri Apr 03 22:27:53 BST 2015
@HazzyC but I think SNP playing games putting at risk potential for Lab govt as helps rebuild case for independence if under a Tory govt Fri Apr 03 22:27:19 BST 2015
@LM_Marlow why would the source - official note of conversation lie? Fri Apr 03 22:24:17 BST 2015
@HazzyC if Scotland returns a load of SNP MPs helps Tories stay in power Fri Apr 03 22:22:33 BST 2015
@LM_Marlow I do as it happens for this reason - https://t.co/olJvPFdJoq Fri Apr 03 22:20:40 BST 2015
@Tedloaf really? Forget it's in the Telegraph, source is official note taken of conversation with ambassador. Why would they lie? Fri Apr 03 22:10:32 BST 2015
@Tedloaf eh? Fri Apr 03 22:03:14 BST 2015
Today started with senior Tories desperately talking up SNP, now we have the evidence SNP really want a Tory govt  http://t.co/Ui8lqI79Ws Fri Apr 03 21:57:21 BST 2015
@MillarRamsay ok pal whatever carry on cozying up to the Tories. You lot play your games but my constituents need a Lab govt Fri Apr 03 21:52:04 BST 2015
@MillarRamsay go and check out what Nicola Sturgeon told the French Ambassador Fri Apr 03 21:47:48 BST 2015
@MillarRamsay who was it joined us when we voted against Tory austerity? Oh yeah wasn't the SNP, they vanished Fri Apr 03 21:42:22 BST 2015
@MillarRamsay and according to news just now SNP would prefer Tories to stay in power Fri Apr 03 21:40:38 BST 2015
So turns out SNP really would prefer Cameron stays in power http://t.co/t7l1UOY5ft Fri Apr 03 21:39:49 BST 2015

. @CarolineFlintMP calling out Gove & Osborne talking up SNP. Voting SNP keeps Tories in power Fri Apr 03 08:39:21 BST 2015
Michael Gove is doing a lot of talking up the SNP hmmmm #fancythat @BBCr4today Fri Apr 03 08:37:18 BST 2015
Now the Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove refusing to rule out a UKIP-Tory coalition. Clear only way to stop a Farage-Cameron govt is #VoteLabour Thu Apr 02 23:12:01 BST 2015
Osborne refusing to rule out coalition with UKIP confirms tonight that Farage pulling Tory strings Thu Apr 02 22:59:22 BST 2015
Extraordinary that this is the format Cameron insisted on, yet he's been flat as a pancake & faded away #invisibleman #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:52:59 BST 2015
Never mind soundbites, Cameron again defending zero hours contracts tonight (at least he's defending something I suppose) #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:50:49 BST 2015
@blairmcdougall some might say he's the #Invisibleman Thu Apr 02 21:42:37 BST 2015
Cameron the #invisibleman https://t.co/O5jEV9NXAL Thu Apr 02 21:41:53 BST 2015
Go on Nick tell us about your tuition fee policy - what was it you promised again before you trebled tuition fees? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:32:50 BST 2015
Did Cameron really just say 'never mind zero hours contracts' - what a flippant out of touch attitude #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:22:29 BST 2015
#invisibleman Cameron lost 26 votes to 2 in Europe. So much for his negotiation style... #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:13:09 BST 2015
It gets worse for Cameron he now can't defend his record on immigration. He's becoming #TheInvisableMan in this debate #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 21:10:03 BST 2015
Cameron literally has nowt to say. Can't defend NHS record and zilch offer for the future. Why did he bother showing up? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:58:07 BST 2015
Is Cameron actually going to get stuck in & try to defend his record on NHS? He's standing on sidelines like a right lemon #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:53:36 BST 2015
Did you know under the Tories the private sector has won a third of NHS contracts since 2013 #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:51:58 BST 2015
Cameron won't tell you the reality of the NHS - more than half of nurses say their ward is dangerously understaffed #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:49:29 BST 2015
Cameron clueless on NHS - 1 in 4 people have to wait a week or more to see a GP under this Tory govt #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:45:32 BST 2015
Hang on Cameron promised this 7 day NHS in last election but what did Cameron actually do? Waste billions on reorganisation #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:42:55 BST 2015
Did you know that last year over 1 million people waited over 4 hours in A&E last year under these Tories #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:40:06 BST 2015
Farage what a phoney - his right hand man was praising the 'whiff of privatisation' in the NHS #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:36:16 BST 2015
In Commons SNP no showed when we voted against Tory austerity cuts #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:30:40 BST 2015
Cameron's cuts will have a crushing impact on public services says @Ed_Miliband #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:28:35 BST 2015
It's worth remembering Dave you promised you would have balanced the books by 2015, what happened to that broken promise? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:25:51 BST 2015
. @Ed_Miliband is right -  this election is a big choice & Cameron wants to double the cuts next year #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:23:37 BST 2015
Good question - why won't Cameron act on £billion avoidance by hedge funds (er maybe coz they fund Tory Party) #leadersdabate Thu Apr 02 20:20:28 BST 2015
Who is Clegg trying to kid, he signed off every single Tory policy & indicated he would stick in a Tory govt #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:19:04 BST 2015
'We'll cut the deficit every year' from @Ed_Miliband #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:15:05 BST 2015
Oh here Cameron goes again but put up VAT, people worse off & failed to balance the books. Deeper cuts to come under Tories #leaderdebate Thu Apr 02 20:13:00 BST 2015
'Britain succeeds when working people' - @Ed_Miliband #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:09:27 BST 2015
Hey Cameron you say economy fixed but er working people £1600 a year worse off #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:07:57 BST 2015
@party_lolitics i know wrong # sorry Thu Apr 02 20:05:24 BST 2015
Oh here's that Tory fella Nick Clegg #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:05:04 BST 2015
I wonder if Farage will tell us about his plans to dismantle the NHS? #leadersdebate Thu Apr 02 20:04:26 BST 2015
Here we go - 7 of them up there but only 1 of them has a better plan for a better future - @Ed_Miliband #leadersdabate Thu Apr 02 20:02:40 BST 2015
@achknalligewelt with City Council we're still trying to work out exactly who legally responsible proving tricky @OweniteAdam Thu Apr 02 19:45:19 BST 2015

@HPL1964 did you read my blog? Serious question? Thu Feb 19 17:10:10 GMT 2015

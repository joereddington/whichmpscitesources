@SikhFedUK Yep hoping to be there
@HPL1964 not at all!
Join East Mids Young Labour, #LabourExpress activists and me in Broxtowe tomorrow #6monthstowinit http://t.co/dK4spST9pu
Gove has 'quickly established himself as the most incompetent and ineffectual Government Chief Whip'  http://t.co/1qquh0gE5A
Was my first time on @BBCNewsnight tonight (from Leicester studio) but means I missed #Gogglebox - now got withdrawal symptoms

@Lopitics thanks
@conradlandin indeed!
@CllrBarrieG @BBCNewsnight cheers Barrie
@Northernruth @EverydaySexism ok well I didn't mean to say it the way I did. Sorry

@Missbad92 Yep of course!
We're adding more & more #LabourExpress campaigns days. Hope you can join me in Broxtowe & Loughborough  https://t.co/0zsjJ2NCz5
@JacobWilkinson ok sorry!
Congrats to Mark Reckless this morning but I reckon @naushabahkhan is the one who'll have a brighter political future. She's been brilliant
Im at Leicester train station. Heading back to Commons to support @CliveEfford 's NHS Bill #backthebill
@jackmatt81 actually Jack we would have lost this seat in 2005 on these boundaries. But UKIP winning is depressing for all kinds of reasons
'The Tories seem quite confident of beating Reckless in Rochester' http://t.co/s59uwztg5x
'Senior Conservatives...are confident they can win in Rochester' http://t.co/7DjYsBKiB0
@LJ_Warner @bbclaurak hahaha ok fair point :)
@bbclaurak move it to Leicester of course!
@HPL1964 well this isn't an easy seat for Labour. Has been Labour in past between 97-05 but sort of seat Labour won in landslide elections
@sgodson1 @BlackHorseLE2 @EverardsTiger @OweniteAdam would be more than happy! Email me and we'll set something up?
@Mogstar666 @OweniteAdam @sgodson1 @BlackHorseLE2 @EverardsTiger good fish & chips too
@OweniteAdam @sgodson1 @BlackHorseLE2 @EverardsTiger ha! Let's get it sorted then. Bit of doorknocking followed by a ping I reckon
@sgodson1 @BlackHorseLE2 @EverardsTiger looks great. I will be down there soon. Maybe @OweniteAdam will even buy me a pint
@Mogstar666 I've tried it many times! Good Sunday lunch too
Talking of #LabourExpress campaign days can you join me in Broxtowe on Sunday? http://t.co/dK4spST9pu

@fairdeal4bury @IvanLewis_MP technically Salford born but did grow up in Radcliffe!
@ianjsilvera @dylsharpe 5 times? Is that a record for a Prime Minister visiting a by election? Serious question?
@ianjsilvera @dylsharpe went at the start with #LabourExpress activists http://t.co/JE2DL007XU
@dylsharpe we are backing her, it's not over yet but we've always been realistic. And on these new boundaries we would have lost in 2005
Fair to say everyone accepts @naushabahkhan has been most outstanding candidate. She'll be a great MP. Best of luck today #RochesterStrood
In Commons today I challenged Francis Maude on check-off and Tory irresponsible politics re industrial relations -  http://t.co/8PVCXDCI2t

@LeicsRutland_CF whatever kiddo
@LeicsRutland_CF listen Tory kid why don't you tweet your own MPs and ask them why they are spending more than planned on welfare

We will remember them. I'll be joining people from across our city at the Victoria Park Remembrance Day Service & Parade. #RemembranceDay
Labour frontbenchers have been out today in key constituencies on campaign trail - That's our focus not Westminster leadership silliness
Fair to say I'm probably from a different tradition in our Party than @TristramHuntMP but he's said that MoS is nonsense & I believe him
@stellacreasy @tim_rigby @wesstreeting now if someone did Angry Anderson on here I would vote for that!
@tim_rigby @stellacreasy @wesstreeting did you know it's 26 years since Scott & Charlene got married today. How about that for cleverness?
Was it Jarvis Cocker storming the stage? #xfactor
@stellacreasy @wesstreeting I'm watching #xfactor for first time this year and I liked that version of Boogie...
We've got 6 months to go & today in key target of Bury North people were desperate to be rid of this Tory shower of a govt. #webackEd

Is it true Twitter that it's Scott and Charlene's 26th wedding anniversary today? Makes me feel old. Time to listen to some Angry Anderson
Does Osborne think folk are daft as his EU budget surcharge spin utterly unravels? See my @BuzzFeedUK post http://t.co/Z4i84waB0p
@Mogstar666 of course!
Making way to Manchester for @LabourStudents #lspw14 and then on to Bury North for our #LabourExpress day to help @JimmyFrith

@Gail_McDade ð
We've strengthened our election team today with @LucyMPowell so with 6 months to go join me in Bury North on Saturday http://t.co/kKGhRDaC0J
The brilliant @GloriaDePiero hammering the Lib Dems here on their woeful record on women's representation http://t.co/jRleiQETi7
Oooh Cameron didn't like great question from @LilianGreenwood on whether he considers it 'immoral' to have raised VAT to 20% #pmqs
There we are Cameron still won't explain how he will fund his Â£7 bn tax cuts promise nor will he rule out big VAT rise again #pmqs
Cameron problem is his supposed EU negotiation is going nowhere & he can't actually tell us whether he will propose staying in or out of EU
#pmqs and again Osborne leaning over frantically whispering trying to tell Cameron what to say. Doesn't it get on Cameron's nerves?!
@tomwilson23 yep
And you can join me & #LabourExpress activists in Bury North this Saturday for @JimmyFrith  http://t.co/kKGhRDaC0J
Absolutely no room for complacency but Ashcroft marginal poll sees Labour winning key targets like Bury North, Croydon Central, Wirral West
Silliness re trade unions & Lab selections in press. For what really happens see my @Telegraph blog from last yr http://t.co/jS6neAI8s8
@Sarah_in_Elton great will see you there! #LabourExpress

Very good discussion with @jlampon & @Sundip on @BBCLeicester just now re #MakeLeicesterBritish #OneLeicester -Ola must return to Leicester!
@JimDavisOnAir @BBCLeicester disagree
@BBCLeicester @JimDavisOnAir @jolouhayward @Channel4 it was utter rubbish to suggest Leicester is divided #OneLeicester
@Nick4125 @Moran_Manc Nick you talk rubbish. And Leicester is my home
@krishgm I think generally Leicester is pretty good though we shouldn't be complacent. It's the suggestion we're not that has annoyed people
@krishgm @LM_Marlow then why call it Make Leicester British and start off describing Leicester as a divided city when we're not?
@MattHopeNotHate @melissamarch it's in the context of tweeting re this channel 4 show but get what you mean
@MattHopeNotHate @melissamarch well this Channel 4 show 'Make Leicester British'. We already are British and proud of our diversity
@MattHopeNotHate @melissamarch eh?
@joewilsonbbc indeed #LeicesterisBritish
@melissamarch we should use #LeicesterisBritish I reckon
@d4mo85 politicians do same things coz they believe it as well y'know
@jlampon it's just utter rubbish. The sweeping generalisations about us apparently being divided. Total crap #LeicesterisBritish
@melissamarch it's just appalling rubbish isn't it
I'm proud to represent St Matthews, Leicester with large Somali community many of whom own vibrant businesses & contribute much to our city
@RupalR to say we are divided is utter crap. I'm not sure I can watch this programme #MakeLeicesterBritish
@LM_Marlow to say we're divided is just utter crap #MakeLeicesterBritish
Sorry #MakeLeicesterBritish our city is not divided
@darshnasoni I'll be watching it as well but as far as i'm concerned Leicester already is British
2 yrs ago HM Queen visited Leicester & was welcomed by folk of all faiths & backgrounds. Wonder if #MakeLeicesterBritish will mention that?
With 6 months to go I'll be in Bury North on Saturday for @JimmyFrith - why not join our #LabourExpress campaign Day http://t.co/kKGhRDaC0J
Not surprised Gove hates being Chief Whips - 2 MPs jumped to UKIP, he's lost 3 votes on bedroom tax, lost vote on OBR & got stuck in loo
@burtmcneill that needs to be reported. Let me know where. Email me
@LabourHistory I knew you would tweet that!
@sammacrory I bet @LabourHistory rules that N Brown wasn't technically in Cabinet?
@LabourHistory Brown, Brown, Beckett?
@peders436 signed the prayer on Friday though it might not have updated online yet

And now back home in Leicester after a fabulous weekend in Blackpool with the kids & Mrs Ashworth
@Liverpool_NS moron
I'm missing @EastMidsLabour conference this weekend - enjoy being in the capital of East Mids, Leicester comrades! #EMLab14
Given Osborne is always leaning over to tell Cameron his lines at PMQS, you would have thought he might mention this- http://t.co/eg4qAMS2v1
@wthjoosUlose you're an imbecile
Everyone in the Labour Party who knew him will deeply miss Paul Cottingham - we're all thinking of @mcashmanCBE today

Osborne leaning over giving Cameron all his lines to take again this week #pmqs
Tory MPs won't like this - 'truly shocking' that 'huge deficit' growing says @Telegraph  http://t.co/PWC5rf7DKV
@warnerrrr_ yeah that would be great, thanks
@Sundip good to see you at Labour's #Diwali2014 celebration. Keep going in Harborough. You've got those Oadby Tories & Liberals worried!
Smart serious appointment - good to see @patmcfaddenmp back on Labour's frontbench
@warnerrrr_ can you email me? Which Labour Club is it?
Well done @manojladwa for superb Labour #Diwali2014 celebration tonight. Good to see @Uma_Kumaran there - she'll be an ace Harrow East MP

Great strong interview from the brilliant @leicesterliz just now on @BBCr4today re Labour's new cancer 1 week test pledge today
@BBCEleanorG if you were there on Weds you could have caught up with our Labour Student #RochesterExpress with @GloriaDePieroMP & me
The fantastic @CliveEfford on @BBCr4today just now talking about Labour's proposals for fan involvement in football governance. Great stuff
Great council by election win for Thurrock Labour & @ThurrockPolly last night - when Labour is out on the doorstep listening we win!
More on this shadowy 'United & Cecil Club' handing the Tories big bucks for their MPs in marginal seats http://t.co/v9EgkOmEUc
Who exactly are 'United & Cecil Club' surely with this amount of cash swishing into Tory accounts we should be told? http://t.co/nUSLWFqYk7
@shaymangus it's been delivered in Clarendon Park as well. We don't know who is delivering this rubbish though
@reporterboy @ChrisBryantMP @IainDale oh & yesterday @GloriaDePieroMP & me there with a load of student activists. Didn't see a Tory...
@reporterboy @ChrisBryantMP @rowland_jamie @IainDale outside of by elections local party members decide. Our PPC Rochester selected locally
@reporterboy @ChrisBryantMP @rowland_jamie @IainDale NEC usually draws up shortlist for by elections but local party members vote

@HPL1964 UKIP MP on telly trying to claim they  have more in common with Keir Hardie

@Bucksrockers @GloriaDePieroMP still for you to get involved why not try it and see what happens
@Bucksrockers @blackviking1 @GloriaDePieroMP thanks so you voted Labour in 2005 but not 2010?
@Bucksrockers @blackviking1 @GloriaDePieroMP but seriously what year did you stop voting Labour I'm genuinely interested?
@Bucksrockers @blackviking1 @GloriaDePieroMP out of interest what point was that in your view? 87, 92, 97, 01 etc? Serious question
@DMUVC I shall see you there!
@election_data I know as it happens loads of my constituents have been in touch with me about the debate on Monday. But I get your point
@election_data I understand point you are making
@election_data I think I do. But given its an issue in Commons on Monday then there is bound to be comment & debate ahead of it
@election_data to be fair the main business in Commons on Monday is a debate and vote on Palestinian statehood
@KarlTurnerMP @labourwhips @LMcInnes_Labour @GloriaDePieroMP @lizperry_ rather be Norman Clegg than Nick Clegg
We're off to Rochester next Wed for @naushabahkhan - join the #RochesterExpress https://t.co/eKB7Fgz6Fj @GloriaDePieroMP @LabourStudents

Great stuff again from @andyburnhammp knocking down the Tories on our NHS http://t.co/mC3eGPtdAi
@melissamarch perfectly respectable position to say no to Iraqi govt but given UK history I couldn't see how we could wash our hands of this
@melissamarch Iraqi govt requested UK take part with other countries in air strikes to combat ISIL. You would have said no to Iraqi govt?
@melissamarch this is not an easy decision at all - come and see me to discuss? Or let's meet on Queens Rd?
Just finished meeting @FMO_Leics with @Mohammeddawood discussing Iraq and ISIS (or Daesh as I prefer to call them)
@UnisonLeicsPol it's not an easy decision for me at all - happy to meet to discuss further?
@KarlTurnerMP am loving these updates. Tell Dennis we want him in Leicester next!
@johnellison why not come & see me to at least discuss?

. @labourpress and only 3 homes sold for Â£2 m plus in Grant Shapps own village of Brookmans Park in last 5 yrs #Toryfibs
@jackmatt81 no idea but again that's just 4 when Grant is trying to suggest it will hit virtually every family home
@jackmatt81 you have misunderstood. Grant described it tax on family homes so I pointed out even where he lives only 3 houses sold for Â£2m
@jackmatt81 no I wasn't Jack. I think you have misunderstood
@jackmatt81 I'm making point even in village Grant lives in he can't stack up claim this is a tax on loads of family homes
@KulganofCrydee about something entirely different that is
@KulganofCrydee gonna DM you something
Me & @grantshapps on mansion tax - where Grant lives in Brookmans Park 3 houses sold for over Â£2 m in last 5 yrs https://t.co/36dzSkJFaE

Did Erewash's brilliant @catkinson80 make Labour history today as first PPC to bring baby to podium - one for @LabourHistory ? #Lab14
The great Jim Kennedy of @UCATTunion just elected Chair of Party at our final NEC meeting of #Lab14
@barbaradougla20 I'm not bothered about where he is born but pointing out he stood in Wythenshaw was standing in Cheshire now in Heywood
@barbaradougla20 @MichaelLCrick that's because scientist members would (I suspect) been in msf Union now part of unite
@barbaradougla20 oh right when he was standing in wythenshaw he said he was the local lad. Surprised you've been taken in
@HPL1964 it's a commitment to more doctors & nurses in the NHS sort of thing lifelong socialists usually like
I'll be talking about Labour's commitment to recruit 20,000 new nurses & 8,000 GPs on @BBCLeicester later & why NHS not safe in Tory hands
@barbaradougla20 she is local. This is third parliamentary seat UKIP fella has been candidate for. He needs to make his mind up!
@barbaradougla20 i just did she's an NHS scientist at Royal Oldham
@barbaradougla20 NHS scientist the UKIP guy is businessman coming up from Cheshire
NHS not safe in Tory hands. Labour will recruit 20,000 more nurses, 8,000 more GPs and 3,000 more midwives #Lab14
Yesterday @GloriaDePieroMP and me helped @LMcInnes_Labour launch the Heywood & Middleton campaign - read more here http://t.co/JbljaNlFIp
Pleasure to meet HE the Palestinian Ambassador at @lfpme reception at #lab14 just now http://t.co/COjuwnjdxD
@barbaradougla20 she works at Royal Oldham Hospital. She's knows what's needed locally. UKIP bloke stood in Wythenshaw & now Weaver Vale
Labour selfie time with @LMcInnes_Labour & @LabourStudents here on the doorstep in Heywood & Middleton #LabourExpress http://t.co/3O14ocUNPf
@barbaradougla20 you're voting for fella from middle of Cheshire standing for his 3rd parli seat then?
In Heywood for brilliant Liz McInnes - local resident just told me UKIP guy has come up from Cheshire - turns out he's PPC for Weaver Vale
We're getting supporters to put Vote Labour posters up here in Heywood @GloriaDePieroMP #labourexpress http://t.co/byR9lnT9cH

@Mogstar666 @charliebach @GloriaDePieroMP yep
@IanAustinMP im delighted @Afzal4Dudley is promoting Leicester but shouldn't he be er promoting Dudley?!...
Just spoke at #lab14 w @GloriaDePieroMP - across our key seats Labour mship is up & we're recruiting more supporters http://t.co/zstPVzopaF
We're opening up our Party & changing. @GloriaDePieroMP and me will be talking about that & the #seasideexpress at #Lab14 at about 11.35
@Martin_Hoscik not seen the report. But would that mean Uxbridge MP should no longer be allowed to vote on issues that affect Leicester?
@Martin_Hoscik happy to examine it but you telling me this is the answer to tackling the alienation many feel from politics?
@HPL1964 I would ask you ie I think we need to involve people and ask what they want
People think politics no longer works. But don't worry folks Cameron is getting John Redwood round to talk about English MPs voting rights
@PaddyBriggs @successcvs no I don't myself personally but isn't this why we need a proper process to thrash it all out?
@JacobWilkinson nope but I'm not pretending I have the answer. I am however in favour of listening to what people want and acting on that
Constituents getting in touch saying we need more powers locally 'like Scotland' - idea English MPs voting rights is answer misses point
@annaturley I've been coming since 1996 - I daren't ask how many @tom_watson has been to #Lab14
@annaturley only 10th?...
@CllrBenJohnson @Labourpaul we certainly did #ACR
@Labourpaul @mattforde hey don't forget Bury's Elbow and throw in some A Certain Ratio for good measure
@HPL1964 yesterday you were tweeting about Michael Foot not being and good. Are you sure you're a lifelong socialist?
@HPL1964 I don't really know what I've done to offend you so much but anyway that's life I suppose
Lots here to think about in this by @Tom_watson plus I also like the references to GDH Cole http://t.co/ADVdh1xhjW
Change starts now - great stuff from @HarrietHarman http://t.co/MJCpkqgca9
@LeicesterTim @BBCLeicester I thought I said there should be a response but we need to respond what to what people wan?
@HPL1964 near Nelson Mandela Park & New Walk etc? Have done door knocking circuit round there which covered Princess Rd but will do another
Whatever happens massive respect to the phenomenal, brilliant and simply fantastic @SheilaMurphy17 & @blairmcdougall #bettertogether
@HPL1964 ok but roughly where? I will make sure we add it to one of our future door knocking sessions
@johnellison glad you'll still vote for me though!
@johnellison we'll see but I'm not genuinely convinced
@johnellison how do you deliver that if you separate off the working classes of Glasgow from the working classes of Leicester? Don't get it
@johnellison for me it's about solidarity. I don't think nationalism is ever the answer
'What we have built together through sacrifice & solidarity let no narrow nationalism split asunder' Vote No today! http://t.co/YUFiWPAURk
On Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street with @HarrietHarman - people switching to no votes here #labourno #letsstaytogether http://t.co/b78DRc959Q

@CCLeicsPolice @geoff_rowe @Fiona_Allan @sarhar1 @leicesterliz @janehill64 @DMUVC me being in there must surely be a mistake
Out talking to people on doorstep in Carmyle - quite a few undecided switching to no - with @HarrietHarman #labourno http://t.co/F3OEJqLuPC
@Mogstar666 we certainly do mate let's get that sorted

Congratulations to local NHS worker @LizMcInnes selected for Labour in Heywood & Middleton
@JacobWilkinson ah because it's so fun winding you up
@JacobWilkinson ha! Did they turn you down ? And no I wasn't done a 'favour ' so no 'favour ' has been returned
@JacobWilkinson you didn't answer mine. So when you joining UKIP?
@JacobWilkinson oooh touchy
@JacobWilkinson you still a Tory? I thought all the Tories were off to UKIP?

@jameschappers he never did give me a lift sadly

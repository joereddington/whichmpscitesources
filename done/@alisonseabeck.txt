@yorkie1 @PlymouthHistor1 not true.  The real prob has been secrecy re her ownership. Can move, buy or moor her if we don't have that info
@yorkie1 @alisonseabeck @PlymouthHistor1 she touched very many people's lives in Plymouth. Sadly, it looks like she is on way to be scrapped
@PlymouthHistor1 I was in contact with MPS, council and business over the years all willing to help as was Lord Owen who was a real champion
@PlymouthHistor1 supporters have been active for years . It was not money but who to deal with. We always felt people would contribute
@PlymouthHistor1 2/2 not knowing who actually owned her and who to approach totally blocked all moves. I wish it had been otherwise
@PlymouthHistor1 @alisonseabeck 1/2 we tried everything inc the MOD and over years City Council under different parties.
@PlymouthHistor1 finance always an issue & not having a berth in City was also a pretty difficult hurdle that's before we get to ownership!
@PlymouthHistor1 city council do care and respect her service and have historically tried to help but it has been so complex.
@gmac193 @alisonseabeck sadly yes.  key supporter advised that mooring had been found. I checked and it hasn't . Need to go back to source
@gmac193 good news but am still seeking more info on poss berth following unsubstantiated rumours

@CllrRosieJolly2 perceptive comments.
@daveih understand your concerns but national security is vital. Labour will be seeking clarity and reassurance in key areas.
@jordannewell if I delete it then it pops up as 'MP deletes tweet ' - shock horror suggesting some devious reason for doing so. Can't win .

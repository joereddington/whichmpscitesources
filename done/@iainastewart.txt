Labour Transport spokeswoman praises new electric bus service in MK but fails to mention it was introduced when Conservatives ran MK Council
@KyleButcher I agree
@KyleButcher interesting point. Politics is very fluid at the moment
I am sad that Alistair Darling is standing down. Too many experienced MPs are. Each Parliament must have new blood but also have balance.
Looking forward to joining MK Ananda Club this evening to celebrate Durga Puja; followed by a charity Poetry in Music concert by Polymnia

Superb PM speech. A clear vision of the hard work needed to continue rebuilding our country. Conservatives are the serious party of Govt.
@Che_Brent most issues are rather more complicated than 140 characters. Plus as an MP I have a duty of confidentiality
@Che_Brent I make it clear on my profile that constituents should email me if they have questions. I don't deal with policy or casework here
Arriving at Chequers earlier today for discussions with the Prime Minister following the referendum http://t.co/Na7cmYJwnZ
Thoroughly enjoying listening to Ferenc Fricsay's interpretation of Adagio from Beethoven's 9th David Mellor's show on @ClassicFM Sublime!

@KyleButcher exactly
@ToryMemo lol
@ToryMemo Highest level of escalation!
Is this a stooshie, a stramash, or a stairheid rammy? #BBCIndyRef Ridiculous standard of debate from Salmond.
@KyleButcher I agree.
@ToryMemo Absolutely. NHS point bogus too. Holyrood has control over how much to spend on NHS

@alicebramall @tgjenkins @ben_walker87 Finished doing your leaflets in Wavendon Gate last night. Have a few left over if you need them.
@ilyLuke_xx Lol. No problems. Not sure I can add much to your knowledge of earthquakes! Good luck with your project :)

@ilyLuke_xx please email me with request to Iain.stewart.mp@parliament.uk
@DArcyTiP @ayestotheright Perhaps I should apply too and complete the set!

After a stressful week, what better way to revive spirits than attending the excellent @MKCityOrchestra concert tonight!
@fidelmacook "Segue" seems to be creeping into meeting-speak with depressing regularity!

@Craig_Lewis77 "Anytime" fares always been more dearer. range of advance ones inc 24hrs notice getting better. < 20% passengers use Anytime
@Craig_Lewis77 You can do it much cheaper if you book ahead. Next Mon MKC-MCR arriving 0830 is £47. Return in evening evening peak £26.50

One upside of today's unnecessary tube strike is that I'm having a trip on a lovely old Routemaster bus for first time in ages :)
@KyleButcher @mike_fabricant It would be a fun game to allocate operas to my colleagues!

Very sad to hear the news about Nelson Mandela. An inspirational man who taught the world reconciliation. May he Rest in Peace.
@korsikoff Lol! Seriously, trains at these times are busy too.
@korsikoff I know plenty people who commute at the times of day when Virgin are providing extra services at MK
@korsikoff @yourmkweb If you read my full press release you will see I have welcomed it as a step forward, not the ultimate solution
@korsikoff New timetable starts on 8th Dec http://t.co/5bbIHmrLjp
I've had a long-running campaign for more Virgin train services available for MK commuters. Delighted that their new timetable provides more
I commend @TomDaley1994 for his courage today. Never easy when you are in the public eye.
One of my all time favourite pieces of music, 3rd movement of Beethoven's 9th, being played on @classicfm now. Perfect chilled start to Sun
Also well done to the Stony Stratford Business Association and Town Council for the switch on of Christmas Lights today

@Rimscar plus how much do you value time to spend relaxing with family on train instead of being stressed out in bank holiday jam on M5! :)

@ayestotheright Beg to differ!
@RAIL Will do!
@RAIL Would be good to meet up to discuss. Have been impressed by last few Rail editorials
Given Maria Eagle's Newsnight interview & the apparent backtracking by Milliband and Balls (Sat Times), not sure where Lab now stand on HS2
Hope all my good friends in @LGBToryUK have a great Manchester Pride weekend. Constituency events mean I cannot join you.

@Jimmyh82 By the same point does the new Labour MP for Manchester Central, elected on a 18% turnout in yesterday's poll, have legitimacy?
Greatly enjoyed chairing tonight the first round of the MK School Debating Competition I organise each year. Impressively high standard.
@Jimmyh82 I would suggest that they have a greater legitimacy than the current police authority which is appointed, not elected.

@PhilipDaviesMP
@MehboobkhanPath The MP there is John Cryer who is a Labour MP but a very good man
@Fizgil Who said it wasn't? I am opposed to quotas as that is not compatible with merit
@scopey123 Thanks for the offer, much appreciated, but my job is to represent people in Shipley not Brighton and I will focus on that
@cupofassam Mark, I wasn't appointed, I was elected and received more votes than your preferred candidate. I hope you will accept democracy
@chloeeelou Thank you. Great to see you and your colleagues too. Thanks for everything you are doing to tackle cyber bullying
@AlMitchell89 I am in Parliament today as I will be tomorrow.
@stellacreasy No, you made up what I said for your own political ends, and won't correct it. People need to know what you are really like.
@stellacreasy Yes, I agree. Let's challenge on what we actually say not by lying about what somebody said.
@scopey123 @AudioSeal1 Oh I see, so pointing out @stellacreasy is a liar makes you misogynistic. Glad to see the pc maniacs out in force
@stellacreasy No, all I can see is that you are a deeply unpleasant liar. I believe in merit and merit alone whether that is 5%, 50% or 95%
@stellacreasy You clearly aren't capable of it as you are totally wrong in what you put. I am correcting your lies
@stellacreasy Merit doesn't include percentage targets - sorry you can't understand that but as the High Priestess of PC you wouldn't
@stellacreasy instead of tweeting in the chamber try listening to what people are saying then you wouldn't make such mistakes. Read Hansard
@stellacreasy No I didn't - I said other argued for that but not me. I know Labour are in a dire situation but lying does you no credit
@stellacreasy Stop lying Stella - I clearly argued all jobs should be given on merit and merit alone irrespective of race or religion
@RidleyWasRight Thank you
@jpmroberts The bookies are usually pretty savvy with their odds. I can't recommend you place a bet on it if you were looking for a good bet
@IanMearnsMP @Fizgil @IanLaveryMP Thanks Ian - I am sure they all felt better off unemployed under Labour!
@Fizgil @IanLaveryMP @IanMearnsMP Unemployment down by c30% in the Shipley constituency in the last year alone. I think I can defend that
@Fizgil @IanLaveryMP @IanMearnsMP I'll be there to listen to the debate and find out why Labour Councils think they are s important to keep
@Fizgil @IanLaveryMP @IanMearnsMP Is that the zero hour contracts rife in Labour Councils like Doncaster (local MP a certain Ed Miliband!)
@ToryEurosceptic Couldn't agree more
@RidleyWasRight Thanks - that's very funny!
@tpild90210 Yes I agree, but it turned out that my cause - opposing the EAW - was not on the agenda due to weasel Govt tactics
@tpild90210 @DuncanBarkes Try reading the article....
@bcfccoxi Thank you for the kind feedback - much appreciated
@RidleyWasRight Didn't want to give such a sham vote any credence by participating in it. When we have a proper vote I'll be there to oppose
@RidleyWasRight We didn't have a vote on the EAW last night - otherwise I would have been there. Last night's proceedings were a scandal
@AndyTheGaffer You are right Andy :)
@francescrook What was the offence Frances? Persistent crimes against common sense? :)
@AlMitchell89 Thanks - good to know
@AndrewMortgageQ @IllingworthMcna It really was a magnificent turnout this morning. Showed perfectly what a wonderful community Bingley has
Pleased to meet my Labour opponent @SteveClapcote today. Am sure we will enjoy a civilised campaign as with @SHinchcliffe & @ChrisLeslieMP
@YorkPolRep @iredalepolitics I agree Nick - come on Tim, it must be far more than 20! :)
@MrsRFlintstone How much would you like the Government to give to asylum seekers genuine or otherwise?
@wrinkyolddog From what I have read the Chancellor has said the Government will pay half; it will have no other effect on future fees/rebate
@geoffbanksbet It is a recommendation in our report. I raised with the Gambling Commission your own case for goodness sake at a SC hearing!
@geoffbanksbet Geoff; you are embarrassing yourself now - we did. Please read our select committee report on Gambling Act. It's all in there
@geoffbanksbet Geoff, try sticking to something you know about (if there is anything). I supported the Offshore Gambling Bill in Parliament
@geoffbanksbet I support all business Geoff - big and small - even those handed down to family members with a silver spoon in their mouth
@CllrRalphBerry At least Eric can make sensible decisions regarding planning applications for Micklethwaite unlike Labour councillors
@politicshome Lib Dems don't believe criminals should be sent to prison. Is that news?
@Ey_up_Kid @KeithWildman Very wise :)
@KeithWildman @Ey_up_Kid Having taken this up the company owners will sort this out and hope to have the lights back on within a week.
@SkiptonBS_press Thank you for the invitation. I found it extremely interesting
@bern132 You have every choice where it goes; at a General Election. Do u want more or less going on welfare? More or less on debt interest?
@bern132 ?? Why would you not want to know where it goes??
@AlMitchell89 They still seem to me to be taking Bradford East and Bradford West for granted at the GE.....they might be in for a shock.
@AlMitchell89 No election is easy; as Labour may discover in Bradford constituencies where they seem to think they can just turn up to win
@AlMitchell89 So we can take it that the Labour Party have nothing positive to offer - don't suppose that should come as a surprise
@AlMitchell89 I thought Labour were not going to stand against me - given how late it is that they have selected a candidate! :)
@AlMitchell89 I have no idea what deal they could ask for that you have in mind? What could I offer to them in return?
@AlMitchell89 Whether UKIP field a candidate against me is a decision for them to make and them alone. I do not make that decision
@AlMitchell89 Nobody votes for a post-election pact. However there are no pre-election pacts so not sure what you are concerned about?
@AlMitchell89 I think pre-election pacts are more democratic than post-election pacts
@geoffbanksbet I have multiple examples in select committee in Parliament (was actually in our report) and at a conference recently
@geoffbanksbet You clearly have a short memory Geoff
@lord_t @bingleylife Yes, I have received a letter today from the new Chief Exec of @sainsburys - if you email me I will send it to you
@Mr_Plastique Without a referendum with a 100% turnout nobody can know for sure. People can decide at the GE if they wish me to continue
@Mr_Plastique I think it is a dream that many of my constituents share. If you have any evidence to the contrary I would be happy to see it
@Mr_Plastique I represent the best interests of my constituents. What basis do u have for thinking all my other constituents agree with you?
@davidslaney23 I voted for recall initiated by the voters tonight
@Sarkavalley Not easy to keep tabs with all the tweets I receive and can't recall seeing yours. Best to email me;you will always get a reply
@thewolvesman Thanks - you are too kind
@thewolvesman Shame on me for copying my words???
@louisehector Only 13 days a year are set aside for Private Members' Bills
@Ey_up_Kid l will do my best. Email me with your details and I can let you know of any update
@DoctorDanLyons @louisehector Not sure on what basis you feel you know the procedures better than me
@DoctorDanLyons If Labour and Lib Dems stop blocking the EU Referendum Bill then there could be time for both. If not then there isn't
@DoctorDanLyons To protect the passage of the EU Referendum Bill through Parliament
@DoctorDanLyons I suggest you read through my earlier tweets
@justiceforGR Anything can be raised in PMQs but only a few MPs get chance to ask a question each week
@justiceforGR Absolutely I will. I consistently oppose dangerous criminals being put in open prisons
@jeremyksm Try looking through my previous tweets and you will see the answer
@AndyTheGaffer No, the Government are doing the same with the EU and FSB; saying what they are paying is generous and can't afford more
@SteveClapcote Congratulations on your selection Steve. I look forward to meeting you and can assure you of a clean and good natured contest
@emmasnosey We entered a coalition with people we disagree with, so I'm sure we could happily have a coalition with people we agree with!
@emmasnosey Thank you; we need to all work together to leave the EU to regain our sovereignty, control our borders and for future prosperity
@emmasnosey Thank you; that's very kind and I'm flattered but I'll continue to fight for us 2 leave the EU from within the Conservative fold
@cicero_101 @KarlTurnerMP @Spiritechoe @UKLabour I believe the PM but don't take the electorate for granted
@KarlTurnerMP @Spiritechoe @UKLabour If Labour would let the EU Referendum Bill through then no need to block this. Over to you Karl....
@MarkMarkSurrey @conservatives @ukip Er, that's why I am trying to get the EU Referendum through!
@Deany_Smith @cjball_london @DanaisGreen I have always supported an In/Out EU referendum which is the Bill I am doing everything to help
@DanaisGreen @Deany_Smith @cjball_london No. Didn't accept a donation. I went to see the animal welfare standards in Denmark
@DanaisGreen @cjball_london Due to the limited time available to get them through. Solution is for Lab and LDs to allow EU referendum bill
@carolejg Yes, 13 days are inadequate but I don't set the rules. I just have to work with what the rules are
@cjball_london @DanaisGreen Well get yourself elected to Parliament and do something about it instead of whining from the sidelines as ever
@Deany_Smith I make no apology for doing what it takes to get an EU referendum Bill through. If Lab and LDs agree to it then this would too
@carolejg There r only 13 days in a year for these Bills. I don't set the rules. Get Lab and LDs to let EU referendum bill through, then ok
@MarkMarkSurrey Why don't you read my tweets and you would find out instead of hurling mindless abuse
@DanaisGreen I just did my best to do that. Time is limited for Private Members' Bills so I have to give the EU referendum the best chance
@DanaisGreen Because the most important PMB is the EU referendum Bill and I cannot risk a Labour MP blocking it with another Bill.
@scopey123 The point I was trying (and clearly failing) to get across is that it does nothing to reduce it - it is affected by other factors
@kevanjudge As every day goes by it gets clearer to people why we need to leave the EU. So pleased I launched Better Off Out in 2006.
@CharlieSnow @jonsnowC4 The account in the Daily Telegraph is the closest to the truth
@BD_Angry @krishgm @jonsnowC4 #Shipley #Bradford It is totally untrue as ITN are now making clear
@GideonSeymour @jonsnowC4 @Channel4News No, the Guardian story is full of lies - as ITN are now belatedly admitting.
@Aidan_Parsons @jonsnowC4 @Telegraph Yes, pretty much so
@cllr_vanda_g Don't believe the lies in the Guardian Vanda - accurate account in the Telegraph. No changes there!
@_horza @ludowhufc @WelshWallaceArt The newspaper will be revealed - will the anonymous Channel 4 news liar - that is the question?
@masterpaul43 @Donna_R_E @MailOnline That is untrue - something even ITN have confirmed to journalists who bothered to find out the facts
@ludowhufc @_horza @WelshWallaceArt I said nothing at all to him before he launched into his tirade which referred to a select committee
@socialistvilla You mean when he published an article which the Guardian took down and he tweeted a withdrawal to me? Yes, very impressive!
@masterpaul43 @Donna_R_E @MailOnline You will believe what you want to believe irrespective of the facts
@ludowhufc @_horza @WelshWallaceArt I think an accurate account will be produced by another paper which bothered to find out the facts
@_horza @WelshWallaceArt As is the Guardian - even ITN have confirmed their account is inaccurate - and as is the Channel 4 news liar source
@Donna_R_E @MailOnline Channel 4 news source/stooge is lying 2 cover up the behaviour of Snow 4 which the chief exec of ITN apologised to me
@_horza No but he was told exactly what happened by senior members of ITN who did. Interesting 2 know if they tell the truth or support lies
@_horza He didn't question me - he hurled abuse at me!
@WelshWallaceArt Thank you
@mjkwalker32 I tried to read your wikipedia entry - it doesn't exist as you're a left-wing nonentity who believes everything in the Guardian
@_horza I know what happened as does the chief exec of ITN who repeatedly apologised to me for Jon Snow's unacceptable behaviour.
@RJ_Pendleton To spare Jon Snow's blushes I have thus far refused to comment but if Channel 4 News will not correct the record then I will
@RJ_Pendleton No it most certainly is not - but I have a feeling the truth will come out and people will get to know what really happened
@ade_robertson @AldiUK @marksandspencer #Bingley Don't know about M+S but have been dealing with blockage with Yorks Water and HA re: Aldi
@BullsBULLieve I have donated
@Stenhouse_1 That's the point. The Bill I opposed would have banned parents from being able have their own children opt out of SRE lessons
@Stenhouse_1 Parents will never do it if the state tells them they don't need to do it. Who's to say all teachers are good at it?
@CllrRalphBerry It was a culture of political correctness making people scared to speak out in case they were accused of being racist
I think you'll find that tackling political correctness in Labour Councils like Rotherham is needed more to stop child abuse @CllrRalphBerry
@BD_Angry Yes - you just need to look at the issues I raise in Parliament. You might say he agrees with me on most things!
@cllr_vanda_g @ChrisLeslieMP @SHinchcliffe I am sure that will be the case. My disagreements with Shipley Labour Party are never personal
@cllr_vanda_g Whoever it is I will welcome them and assure them of a very clean fight, as I had with both @ChrisLeslieMP and @SHinchcliffe
@cllr_vanda_g Doesn't show much respect to the Shipley constituency from Labour that you are selecting a candidate so close to the election
@louisehammersle Good to see you again Louise - enjoyed our discussion
@SimonMagus Simon; figures go up and down so clearly nothing to do with SRE - see evidence to Education Select Committee from Prof Paton
Great to meet you today @svaughanbrown - hope to see you again sometime soon. Good luck trying to get hold of one of those funky WB chairs!
@DuncanBarkes Thanks Duncan
@smpenn Thank you
@alstewitn @itvnews Thanks Alastair - great to meet you and @nightingaleitv and hear about both of your Yorkshire backgrounds!
@Griffiths1961 I can only suggest you read my speech
@MEDGA2504 Thank you
@BeverlyMacca1 Always a pleasure to hear from you Bev
@joelfoolery @greenmiranda @IanDunt #battleofideas Thanks for the invitation Joel and for chairing it so well too
@EddieHughes It was great to be there and to meet you. Thank you so much for the lift back to the station.
@nurseryhalifax I am wholly opposed to a Regional Assembly. The last thing we need is more politicians or more bureaucracy
@RiazMMM because there is right and wrong on both sides and equally important for Palestinians to recognise the state of Israel
@AndyTheGaffer It was showing how public sector workers are far better paid with far better pensions than those in the private sector
@AndyTheGaffer It is not a question of what is deserved, it is a question of what can be afforded. You should have seen ITN News at Ten
@AndyTheGaffer the difference is Labour set up the law on IPSA so that MPs can legally have no input at all on the decisions they come to
@AlMitchell89 What is important is finding a sustainable and peaceful solution, not stunts generated by those who only can see one side
@AlMitchell89 I repeat, I support a two state solution & there is right and wrong on both sides. Blinkered to think right is all on one side
@AlMitchell89 I will when Palestinians recognise the Israeli state. One cannot happen without the other
@AlMitchell89 I believe in a Palestinian state. There is right and wrong on both sides, and Palestinians also need to recognise Israel state
@AlMitchell89 No I won't. I'm not even sure if they would want me :)
@Beachbum19777 You should contact the Local Enterprise Partnership. Email me or come to see me if you wish to discuss or I can help further
@rigbycf Let's meet up and discuss. If you email Sophie at sophie.dean@parliament.uk she will happily fix up a date and time to meet
@scm97_ Great. If you email my Office Manager, Mimi, at mimi.macejkova@parliament.uk she will happily fix this up
@scm97_ I am pleased you enjoyed it. If you ever want to come back to Parliament sometime to spend a few days in my office you're v welcome
@lisbon129 Thank you for coming today. It was good to meet you too.
@bingleylife That bit is out of my control but I certainly hope so.
@bingleylife I have intervened with the Minister and the impasse between the Council and Highways Agency has been resolved. Should be fine.
@Placethismustbe Thank you so much. That is extremely kind and much appreciated
@WelshWallaceArt What you are doing is fantastic. I wish you every success and if I can help with anything please let me know
@GracieSamuels @MSmithsonPB I am certainly not defecting to "Uflip" whoever they are! :)
@PolskiHipis Of course :)
@HughesyRhi Thanks - whoever said that is far too kind. The other panelists were far better than me, but delighted to support @WhizzKidz
@UEALibDems @MSmithsonPB No, @Nigel_Farage hasn't asked me to join UKIP
@RuthOwenOBE @Pwebstertimes @fetim @WhizzKidz #con14 Thank you Ruth for the invitation and for everything you do. Look forward to meeting up
@Iain_33 @MSmithsonPB I think that is a sensible course of action
@RUStuff @WhizzKidz Thank you; lovely to meet you #extracostcommission #CPC2014
@MSmithsonPB I am delighted to be contributing to Ladbrokes profits! I usually contribute to them with my money!
@AdyParkinson I will come and say hello - you are a good man even if we don't agree. Wonder if your boss will shake my hand this year
@jonwhitmore76 Because I abstained. If you email me I will happily explain why as have to many others - philip.davies.mp@parliament.uk
@Randomisation20 Yes, the committee unanimously approved her appointment
@CllrRalphBerry Instead of your dodgy propaganda you should explain why Labour council have cut funding for Shipley more than anywhere else
@tomwilson23 @CllrRalphBerry Exactly - good luck trying to explain that to Bradford's Labour Council!
@tomwilson23 @CllrRalphBerry Yes exactly, but Labour's distortions don't compare the percentage cut, they only talk of cash cuts
@SaltaireSam @CllrRalphBerry Because I get fed up of Labour's deliberately misleading garbage. They are economically illiterate as Ed proves
@CllrRalphBerry As Bradford gets £280 per head and Hart gets £15 per head, it is obvious to anyone who will get biggest cash cut per head
@CllrRalphBerry You are the one who said you wanted Bradford to get the same as Hart which means you want a c£265 per head cut for Bradford
.@CllrRalphBerry Either you are deliberately distorting the facts, or you're so thick that if brains were dominos then you would be knocking
.@CllrRalphBerry Anyone with half a brain knows that if you are only getting £15 a head to start with the cut per head is going to be less!
.@CllrRalphBerry The real figures are stark and your Party political spin has been exposed for all to see. You must think everyone is thick.
.@CllrRalphBerry said he wants the Govt rev grant to Bradford to be same as Hart in Hants. Bradford gets £283.38 per head; Hart gets £15.80
@SimonDanczuk @grsclack Comparing you to me is most certainly not a compliment for you Simon! However I do consider it a compliment to me :)
@ashleykporter @FirstWYorks_bus @wymetrotravel Clearly not. Email me with the details and I will take it up for you
@DuncanBarkes Thanks
Thanks @DuncanBarkes - very kind but I don't think I deserve to be put in the same category as the greats @georgegalloway & @Nigel_Farage
@alancalder No,an education secretary would have to deliver a programme which England wanted - it is called democracy! Happy for ref on EVEL
@alancalder No - it would simply stop Scottish MPs imposing things on England we don't want that doesn't affect their constituents
@alancalder There would be a Labour PM but they would not have a majority in Parliament for any proposals which only affected England
@am4r1 @EditorAsianSun @georgegalloway Well @SHinchcliffe was a worthy opponent last time but she may replace Gerry Sutcliffe.  Why not you?
@am4r1 @EditorAsianSun @georgegalloway @SHinchcliffe Yep, am scared of Labour's non-existent candidate in Shipley. Shows Labour's interest.
@DavidHumphreysA @EditorAsianSun @georgegalloway How about a candidate in Shipley at the General Election George?
@Timmyapples @CllrRalphBerry and how was it so much different under 13 years of Labour rule? Is that why Labour bust the country everywhere?
@Timmyapples @CllrRalphBerry Back in the real world, public spending per head in Yorkshire/Humber 8610pa, spending in the South East 7638pa
@Timmyapples @CllrRalphBerry I will get the fundings per head. I think you should try getting your political blinkers off and get the facts
@Timmyapples It is @CllrRalphBerry who said he wants the same funding as Hart in Hampshire per head not me
@Sarkavalley If you read the tweets I've sent out over the last few days I think I have made my views clear and you will be happy with them
@CllrRalphBerry @robfrombirky @prospect_uk I am sure councils in Hampshire would love the same funding per head as Bradford gets (+ wastes)
@englishoak @stgeorgeiscross Yes of course I will be
@geoffbanksbet If that was what the referendum was about the Yes vote would have been far higher
@StraightlineBoy @BanTheBBC I do concentrate lots of time helping Bingley. Email me with your full postal address and I will take this up
@99_hp @RFCSwitcheroo Yes of course
@jackh1888 @brido872 Maybe. I can't speak for them - I can only speak for me
@Wytherman @LabourEoin My advice would be to not believe everything Alex Salmond tells you
@RFCSwitcheroo Because if the 3 main Party leaders say something will happen they will have enough votes in Parliament for it; just not mine
@p1bet @andrewpercy He is a good man and a great local MP
@SeumasG Yes to the first bit, no to the second bit
@RFCSwitcheroo Thanks. No I don't believe he was being disingenuous at all - and it will happen - I just think he was misguided
@johnbroom1970 @The_TrickyTree @DPJHodges Never stood against me before. UKIP leader at last election came to campaign for me
@dmconnors @GuidoFawkes No - we don't need another layer of politicians. Just have English MPs voting on matters that only affect England
@neilg6760 @AasmahMir Errr, I can't vote on things decided by the Scottish Parliament - that is the point!!!
@phigster It's called a democracy....and you call me an idiot! :)
@nicksco77 I want Scotland to vote no, but not based on unaffordable bribes to be paid for by my constituents
@leemingpaterson I hope you will vote No - I certainly would if I lived in Scotland
@The_TrickyTree @DPJHodges I don't need the PM's permission to speak up on behalf of my constituents. He didn't speak to me b4 "The vow"
@cyclodunc @fionahtweet The ones that Alex Salmond keeps giving you that makes you think Scotland financially subsidies England.
@NealHockley @roger_scully Not the things decided by the Welsh Assembly (obviously!)
@TomDeLaCooper @paul_eae There are plenty of them emailing me. I am sure it is the majority view of my constituents
@leemingpaterson They will go through as promised by the Party leaders, but I will not vote for them. I will be in a minority though
@paul_eae @LordAshcroft I don't stab people in the back as the PM knows well. I just speak up for my constituents which I was elected to do
@paul_eae @LordAshcroft I agree but I don't agree with a No vote at any price at all that my constituents are expected to pay
@paul_eae That's decided by my constituents in Shipley, not by you however important you think you are
@paul_eae @LordAshcroft I will speak up for the best interests of my constituents at all times, and will not be deterred by a Tory donor
@Time_Architect Absolutely - I launched the Better Off Out (of EU) group in Parliament in April 2006 - long before it became fashionable
@Martin_L_1874 @fionahtweet Some might be intimidated by your pathetic bullying. I am certainly not.
@WelshWallace Thank you - if you take twitter as being representative there are far more that loathe me than love me!
@Chris_Lamb @faisalislam They are the same as they always were
@BluesStill Because these promises are being made this week
@fionahtweet Keep taking the tablets
@AnneJarvis7 @bingleylife At the public meeting Sainsbury's said they'd 2 firm approaches; 1 for residential and 1 mixed retail/residential
@jimnoakes No - I believe it is the best way to represent the best interests of my constituents. Not something Labour thinks about clearly
@GarethSBrown No - if you recall John Prescott's attempts to introduce this were rejected by the electorate massively
@AyrGJH I have one role and one role only - to speak up for my constituents and their best interest
@GarethSBrown No, I don't support Regional Government. I just want a fair deal for England within the UK
@Mr_Eugenides It is not a referendum to win at any price on a false prospectus which negatively affects my constituents
@WelshWallace Thank you
In the event of a No vote, I will be doing all I can to stop MPs from Scotland voting on issues in Parliament which don't relate to Scotland
For the record, I will not be voting to maintain an unfair funding settlement for Scotland whatever Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg say
@SaltaireWebsite Thank you
@bingleylife Yes, you are not the only one to mention it.  I am continuing to press them as I always have and always will
@katelucywhitham @BearBoating Please email me with a reminder of your full postal address and I will happily take it up for you
@jane738 He was a great man who stood up for what he believed in; represented magnificently a huge body of opinion in NI and was a kind man
Really sad to hear of the death of Ian Paisley. 1 of my Parliamentary heroes; was privileged 2 make my maiden speech in a debate he spoke in
@ToryBoy1965 Thanks
@HKTuff @gavinmegaw @parkrunUK #wishfulthinking My eldest son will be taking part. My participation would create a by-election in Shipley
@beefyboyberry @MarkReckless @PeterBoneMP @BillCashMP I think you are confusing me for the chief whip. I can only speak for myself
@beefyboyberry @MarkReckless @PeterBoneMP @BillCashMP I'm probably not the best MP to ask about Party whipping arrangements
@beefyboyberry @MarkReckless @PeterBoneMP @BillCashMP I will be doing my best!
@noreadingingaol But you've just admitted that there isn't a shortage of books in prisons
@noreadingingaol So also nothing to do with Howard League's politically motivated campaign either then
@mstoneman81 Absolutely - that is why I am supporting them!
@SarahDunwell @Monica_BC_BITC Great to see you and hear all about your new initiative. Looking forward to a #socialsupermarket in Shipley
@PolskiHipis @JSandlerClarke Actually local authorities provide the books for prison libraries too....
@MrJackHughes I couldn't agree more
@Appearstobedumb You are asking the wrong person; you need to ask IPSA. If I am voted out at the General Election I won't get any pay at all
@LouiseMensch Don't worry I will. Every time left-wingers who have nothing to offer but abuse get wound up I know I must be doing well :)
@LouiseMensch Why thank you Louise
@Davee57 Email me with the details and your full postal address in the shipley constituency and I will happily take it up for you
So so sorry to learn of the death of Labour MP Jim Dobbin. One of the nicest, most honourable and decent MPs - he will be greatly missed
@GillJohnson2 @mmaher70 I will look forward to meeting you
@GillJohnson2 @mmaher70 You are welcome to see me - sophie.dean@parliament.uk to make an appointment. Why did Lab council not spend all DHPs
@jacquep #bedroomtax #r4today Criticised for going too far and criticised for not going far enough....the joys of Government
@kdog_1 @InspGadgetBlogs Mine's changed in the way that everyone else's has in the public sector.Still better than any in the private sector
@InspGadgetBlogs Yes to pension reform not to reduced numbers. I voted against cuts to Police budgets
@InspGadgetBlogs @daily_politics Yes - I am always pro-Police
@tonybosworth @northernrailorg I don't disagree. Have a number of disputes with them at the moment
@simonbullock Haven't received it yet
@simonbullock No - which is why I wrote to the Minister about it. Haven't received your DM
@simonbullock @northernrailorg Email me with your full postal address and I will send you the Minister's response
Many thanks 2 @ShawTrust for making me so welcome on my visit today. I learnt a lot and great to see at first hand the fantastic work u do
@lizward64 @garyavfchorton Thank you
@_TheGMan @JohnAndrews2 @GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver Leaders are temporary. Conservative values are not. After Heath came Thatcher
@mrjoelclark @GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver @David_Cameron I remind people of it all the time
@Pete_Reynolds Thankfully in the UK the PM does not tell the Police who to arrest, the CPS who to prosecute and the courts who to convict
@_TheGMan @JohnAndrews2 @GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver Maybe, maybe not - you don't just decide to stand for Party that gives you most votes
@Pete_Reynolds Indeed - but fortunately in the UK politicians cannot interfere in criminal proceedings. They are decisions for courts
@Michael_Heaver @GaiusCa1igu1a I am a Conservative and hold Conservative views and believe in timeless Conservative values
@garyavfchorton @GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver @David_Cameron Thanks for that - much appreciated
.@JohnAndrews2 @GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver @David_Cameron Depends who the MP is and how active they are
.@Michael_Heaver @GaiusCa1igu1a Yes - that is why candidates have their own election address. I do and I stick by what I promise in it
@Pete_Reynolds Not in my world. That is why we need to scrap the Human Rights Act for which we need a Conservative majority Government
.@GaiusCa1igu1a @Michael_Heaver At a General Election u r voting for the person you want to represent you in Parliament not @David_Cameron
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ No. Do Shipley Labour support your PC views? Happy to promote that for you if they do
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ To finance what? Why don't you stand for election against me as a pro-PC candidate. See how you get on?
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ @DailyMirror Yes please Jack - so all can see how far the Labour Party has lost touch with working class
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ Jack, will you run a story in the Mirror on my tweet. I'd love yr readers to c what Lab Party has become
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ Is this the week where political correctness was blamed for allowing the Rotherham scandal to go unchecked
@Jack_Blanchard_ According to Labour PC extremists if you correctly use the word crippled you are being offensive to all disabled people
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ You see Jack, these are the PC extremist idiots that have taken over Labour who you now have to support
@SallyAbbott3 So you have decided that BAME people want white middle class guardian reading PC lefties to decide what's best for them.
@FrediSmith @actforchangehq No, that is what I am proposing - merit irrespective of race. That is not what you are suggesting at all
@RiazMMM @SallyAbbott3 @actforchangehq My alternative strategy is called merit. Jobs should be given to the best person irrespective of race
@SallyAbbott3 @RiazMMM @actforchangehq Actually you are wrong. Most ethnic minorities hate the PC peddled on their behalf by white lefties
@FrediSmith @actforchangehq Yes, that is my point! You seem to think that it is OK to discriminate against one specific race - I don't.
@FrediSmith @actforchangehq That is what you are proposing. You now want to discriminate against people just for being white.
@FrediSmith @actforchangehq Giving someone a job because of their race is not the solution to not giving a job due to their race. Both wrong
@RiazMMM @actforchangehq I don't agree with politically correct quotas. Giving or refusing a job because of someone's race is always wrong
@Phillip_D_Jones Fool - it wasn't even about disability. It was about why landlords are reluctant to take on ANY tenants on housing benefit
@DAZZA3201 @DouglasCarswell Thank you for your kind comment
@TruthHuntPeace @TenPercent Please do. PC bullies have no popular support which is why you won't stand for election+hide behind intimidation
@TenPercent I know most people aren't used to straight talking from MPs.Love those who like to hurl abuse at MPs but bleat when they respond
@TenPercent I didn't call all disabled people PC extremists as you alleged.Your pathetic childish idiotic PC bullying will not work with me
@TenPercent The tweet I replied to. You are a prime example of the PC bullies who were responsible for what happened in Rotherham.
@Cornervizion @newapproach_UK @Mandi_Tinker You all ought to see what politically correct bullies (eg you) brought about in Rotherham.
@TenPercent You should "liar" on to the long list of things you claim to be on your twitter profile. A pretty pathetic liar at that.
@thomasbrake Don't worry Tom - I will be there :)
@newapproach_UK @Mandi_Tinker An apology to politically correct extremists who see offence where none is intended - don't be ridiculous
@DanHannanMEP Yes - the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire should be taking heed!
@Phillip_D_Jones @Jack_Blanchard_ What a politically correct idiot you are. Obviously you have learnt nothing from Rotherham #pczealot
@MuslimDAwarenes Sorry - I clearly confused you with someone who wanted a sensible discussion. That comment is reprehensible and idiotic
@MuslimDAwarenes You asked me to explain it and I gave you the reason I suspect explains it. Nothing at all to do with disability
@MuslimDAwarenes It's probably because they can't get the rent paid direct until it hasn't been paid for 8 weeks and that cripples landlords
@SaltaireSam You weren't prompted to tweet about the disgusting record of a Labour Council, only a Conservative MP who criticised it. Awful
@BBCLookNorth @GuidoFawkes So the logic is if he does resign then he will remain a welcome member of the Labour Party despite his record
@JohnAndrews2 Your priority was to criticise me for raising it than those who perpetrated it. Says it all about tribal PC Labour supporters
@SaltaireSam You make no tweets about those involved in turning a blind eye to disgusting child abuse but chastise me for raising it.
@SaltaireSam I know you specialise in talking drivel but have you seen my record in criticising my own Party which makes your tweet idiotic
@JohnAndrews2 I haven't turned a blind eye to disgusting child abuse. Interesting that you choose to turn your fire on me instead.
@JohnAndrews2 Your politically correct attempt to stop anyone criticising a Labour council is part of the problem. Doesn't work with me
@SaltaireSam @EdMilliblandMP So criticising a Labour Council for presiding over this disgusting failure is points scoring is it? Says it all
@JohnAndrews2 It is your tribalism that means you can't bear for your beloved Labour Party to be criticised...even after this! Disgusting
@JohnAndrews2 No, the Labour howls would be deafening. You should look at my record in Parliament to see that I criticise my own side often
@JohnAndrews2 So the Labour dominated Council can't be criticised by anyone who is a Conservative after this scandal? Don't be absurd
@JohnAndrews2 Try taking off your political blinkers for one moment and then see what the one Party state in Rotherham has presided over
@JohnAndrews2 No, to put political correctness ahead of protecting vulnerable children is "absolutely sickening". Sorry you can't see that
@afneil @LouiseMensch Also what about the previous MP for Rotherham - @DenisMacShane - what did he do all the years he was there?
@cableguyisblak If you would like me to pursue it with Bradford Council email me your full postal address and I happily will do so

@SaltaireSam @BBCr4today Thank you for confirming you have no answer to that - which is absolutely the point. Mon Apr 27 11:00:15 BST 2015
@SaltaireSam @BBCr4today More more people are brought down by alcohol addiction. Where's the campaign to ban alcohol? Mon Apr 27 10:55:21 BST 2015
@Dazpower @banksthomasw Looking forward to debating with you again. Don't agree with you about much (if anything) but you are a great man Sun Apr 26 21:22:31 BST 2015
@rigbycf Bingley Baptist Church - Thursday at 7.30pm Sun Apr 26 20:45:41 BST 2015
@rigbycf Thanks. Like everyone I've no idea what the outcome of the election will be. We need to work hard for every vote. It's vital we win Sun Apr 26 20:38:56 BST 2015
@discovery77_ Yes I do Sat Apr 25 16:19:47 BST 2015
@angelahacking Yes I am Sat Apr 25 14:05:26 BST 2015
@baildonwoody I totally agree.  I will keep pursuing Network Rail and their tenants to try to get this resolved. Thu Apr 23 23:44:44 BST 2015
@OfficerWild I am not sure 140 characters can do it justice. Please email me at philip.davies@shipleyconservatives.org.uk Thu Apr 23 12:54:55 BST 2015
@realperidot54 Yes - absolutely. Have been in touch with @SimonDanczuk to offer my support to him Wed Apr 22 22:43:00 BST 2015
@Dazpower @SteveClapcote @kevinwarnes Great stuff - look forward to locking horns again later. Wed Apr 22 13:19:57 BST 2015
@RiazMMM The fact that Tesco's Chairman is so divorced from the views of his customers explains perfectly why they are doing so badly Sun Apr 19 23:05:36 BST 2015
@rooksyjunior @SteveClapcote @kevinwarnes You will be getting leaflets through the post from everyone Sun Apr 19 20:33:56 BST 2015
@rooksyjunior @SteveClapcote @kevinwarnes Obv none of us can get round to every house in the constituency. I will knock on doors they don't. Sun Apr 19 20:12:21 BST 2015

@katewestern Please email me - philip.davies@shipleyconservatives.org.uk Thu Apr 16 00:22:15 BST 2015
@cynical_bill I won't change my opinion but would have to accept the result - that is democracy. Tue Apr 14 12:57:24 BST 2015
@BernardGinns Freedom of choice. Why should people pay for something they don't want. If everyone wants it they will subscribe. Tue Apr 14 12:53:42 BST 2015
@cynical_bill It will give the public the choice and I will clearly campaign to leave as will very many other Conservatives. Tue Apr 14 12:52:49 BST 2015
@cynical_bill Scotland voted for the status quo - I hope that will not happen in an EU referendum Tue Apr 14 09:25:50 BST 2015
@cynical_bill I hope so - as I hope people will vote to leave. Tue Apr 14 09:15:13 BST 2015
@BernardGinns Yes Tue Apr 14 09:14:42 BST 2015
@OtherFrin Monday 20th April - Burley in Wharfedale; 21st April - Shipley; 22nd April - Wrose; 30th April - Bingley Mon Apr 13 23:22:25 BST 2015
@Dazpower I did have a flutter on the National. Backed The Druid's Nephew which was in the lead on the final circuit when he fell. Sat Apr 11 21:17:05 BST 2015
@Alex_Ross_Shaw They are accurate quotes - nothing more nothing less. Thank you for highlighting what Labour Shadow Ministers say about me Sat Apr 11 14:15:24 BST 2015
@Alex_Ross_Shaw Hilarious stuff. Labour's Cathy Jamieson complaining about being accurately quoted from Hansard. You couldn't make it up Sat Apr 11 02:35:15 BST 2015
@ssoar @ChrisLeslieMP You will have to ask him the latter question.  However, he was a very tough and worthy opponent who I greatly respect Sat Apr 11 01:52:07 BST 2015
@StuartLong01 @Doctorwhizz I have no idea at all.  Stick in a pin and hope for the best! Sat Apr 11 00:24:53 BST 2015
@AndyHolderIFA Thanks - will be knocking on doors in Menston tomorrow evening. Can't get round every house but we do as many as time allows Fri Apr 10 08:51:05 BST 2015
@AndyHolderIFA I can't get to every place in my constituency all at the same time. Out all day every day - will get everywhere inc Menston Thu Apr 09 22:16:34 BST 2015
@Dazpower @YorkshireFirst He came up a couple of weeks ago to speak at a dinner for me. Thu Apr 09 21:08:05 BST 2015
@rialise40 @TheSun I agree with you that we need a Conservative majority in the House of Commons Thu Apr 09 17:19:18 BST 2015
@ukinfinitecoach You love it really! ðŸ˜„ Tue Apr 07 22:50:53 BST 2015
@MrMisterDavid Thanks; we are out all day every day up until the election and will knock on as many doors as possible. Can't do all but lots Tue Apr 07 22:44:16 BST 2015
@MrMisterDavid That means Labour were doing nothing in the places we were canvassing today. We will get everywhere - including Eldwick Tue Apr 07 22:33:13 BST 2015
@Chopper_Harris Thank you Tue Apr 07 20:03:30 BST 2015
@ukinfinitecoach I am sure @JasonMcCartney will be more than happy to release you to spend the odd day in sunny Shipley! Tue Apr 07 17:18:29 BST 2015
@ukinfinitecoach Hi Alex - good to hear from you. So far so good - especially if the weather stays as it is today! Feel free to come over ðŸ˜„ Tue Apr 07 15:41:29 BST 2015
@darrenspink @Crossley_Evans Nothing more that I can add to the article. Will continue to do all I can to press for a speedy resolution Mon Apr 06 23:52:07 BST 2015
@sainsburys Thanks Bobby - I appreciate it Mon Apr 06 15:08:19 BST 2015
@bingleylife @IllingworthMcna @sainsburys I am always chasing them up.  I have also an election to fight in the meantime as well. Mon Apr 06 12:52:19 BST 2015
@kevanjudge @WheresGeorge9 I am afraid that I don't have the same style and panache as @georgegalloway - couldn't carry it off as he can Sun Apr 05 20:57:24 BST 2015
@IllingworthMcna @sainsburys I have heard no more from them since they announced they had received two firm offers which you are aware of Sun Apr 05 19:12:00 BST 2015
@rooksyjunior I suggest you speak to YouGov. My job is to do the best for my constituents and the election result shows representation Sun Apr 05 16:33:51 BST 2015
@benpickles sorry! Sun Apr 05 14:17:18 BST 2015
@BenPickles You said you HAVE to be a union member to stand for Labour this year. That discriminates against non-union members obviously Sun Apr 05 13:50:37 BST 2015
@Dazpower @BenPickless We don't discriminate against anyone who wants to be a Conservative Party candidate. Now we know Labour bullies do. Sun Apr 05 12:17:19 BST 2015
@SaltaireSam @Dazpower @BenPickless Says all you need to know about Socialist approach to freedom of choice. You HAVE to be a union member! Sun Apr 05 12:05:57 BST 2015
@BenPickless Are you serious? To be a Labour candidate this year you HAVE to be a union member?! Many people will be interested to know that Sun Apr 05 11:17:24 BST 2015
@Dazpower I will be in a suit and tie Sat Apr 04 22:06:01 BST 2015
@Dazpower @Nigel_Farage There was no UKIP candidate in 2005 or 2010. I have not done a deal with anyone and there might be a UKIP candidate Sat Apr 04 20:41:30 BST 2015
@Dazpower Given the number of followers he has, I don't think @georgegalloway needs any Twitter advice from me! Sat Apr 04 19:51:49 BST 2015
@Dazpower It was the same for me in 2005. Sat Apr 04 19:48:05 BST 2015
@PaulTheTurbo Certainly not. Sorry about that - not sure how that happened. If you email me your address I will make sure you get one Sat Apr 04 16:18:51 BST 2015
@bearisity @GeorgeMorrall That is simply untrue. You are either a liar or don't have a clue what you are talking about. You can choose. Fri Apr 03 23:08:28 BST 2015
@bearisity @GeorgeMorrall You said I'd blocked the debate on this Bill from taking place; that's a lie.It wasn't debated as low down on list Fri Apr 03 22:32:34 BST 2015
@bearisity @GeorgeMorrall I am afraid you have no idea what you are talking about, but don't let that get in the way of your rant. Fri Apr 03 22:19:35 BST 2015
@bearisity @GeorgeMorrall It has never come forward for debate. You wanted it approved without even a debate taking place. Fri Apr 03 22:15:37 BST 2015
@GeorgeMorrall The debate hasn't been blocked George. It has not been debated because it was so far down the list of Bills to be considered. Fri Apr 03 22:01:55 BST 2015

@John_Rushforth Thank you - I very much appreciate it Thu Apr 02 21:33:09 BST 2015
@Chopper_Harris Thanks for the feedback - it was the relative performance I was drawing attention to. Wed Apr 01 16:12:19 BST 2015
@kevanjudge There are 4 already arranged in Burley in Wharfedale, Wrose, Shipley & Bingley on 20th,21st,22nd & 30th April Wed Apr 01 15:04:23 BST 2015
@Mr_Plastique Out all day every day around the constituency. Big area to cover so can't knock on every door but do as many as we can Wed Apr 01 15:00:07 BST 2015
@Rob_Merrick Is that a shock to you Rob - I thought you followed politics? Wed Apr 01 13:33:36 BST 2015
@cynical_bill If you email me then you will be able to judge the speed of my response for yourself as those constituents who do can testify Tue Mar 31 09:26:22 BST 2015
@cynical_bill not my score but by independent http://t.co/ovJhMdnlzo - you can see how it compares with others Tue Mar 31 09:11:01 BST 2015
@Alex_Ross_Shaw Nice try Alex - but what's all this about being on the phone? Some of us were out in the pouring rain knocking on doors! ðŸ˜… Mon Mar 30 19:51:09 BST 2015
@cynical_bill If it makes you better to think that. What I am more interested in is how many people are prepared to vote for each candidate Mon Mar 30 17:37:25 BST 2015
@cynical_bill To protect them from intolerant left-wing bullies who seem to be well represented on twitter Mon Mar 30 14:28:38 BST 2015
@Yorksmilkmaid I certainly will - no offence intended I can assure you Sat Mar 28 18:06:42 GMT 2015
@Yorksmilkmaid Will look forward to seeing you at a future farmers market there. Sat Mar 28 15:59:20 GMT 2015
@Yorksmilkmaid I was actually at the Wharfedale Fine Cheeses stall run by a constituent of mine - doesn't get much more local than that! :) Sat Mar 28 15:58:39 GMT 2015
Huge thanks to @NW_alanw for a brilliant presentation at my business budget breakfast.  Great feedback from those who attended. Sat Mar 28 02:00:31 GMT 2015

@joseppistorey @toadmeister I think I am right in saying that Ed Miliband's own Labour council in Doncaster uses zero hour contracts Thu Mar 26 23:51:52 GMT 2015

@baildonwoody philip.davies.mp@parliament.uk Thu Mar 26 22:38:45 GMT 2015
@AndrewMortgageQ Thank you - very kind. Was good to see you Thu Mar 26 22:27:57 GMT 2015
@Donster22 I am doing all I can; have taken up with both Councils, raised it in Parliament, met with Bradford chief exec. They're digging in Thu Mar 26 07:57:58 GMT 2015
@Donster22 It is ridiculous. Leeds Council have made clear they want to carry on with a reciprocal arrangement. Bradford refuse to do so. Thu Mar 26 00:34:35 GMT 2015
@OtherFrin Mine should be up there too Wed Mar 25 10:51:53 GMT 2015
@Dazpower I will be at all of the hustings meetings - happy to have a drink with you afterwards. Wed Mar 25 09:15:49 GMT 2015
@Dazpower I will look forward to seeing you at the hustings meetings with all the other candidates whoever they all might be. Wed Mar 25 09:11:52 GMT 2015
@Dazpower So if there is no Respect candidate in Shipley - by your logic - does that mean I have done a deal with @georgegalloway? Wed Mar 25 09:10:19 GMT 2015
@Dazpower So why are you not asking @georgegalloway why he isn't standing a candidate in Shipley at the General Election? Wed Mar 25 09:05:00 GMT 2015
@Dazpower Well I know for a fact that the Lib Dems have selected a candidate. How come Respect haven't selected a candidate to oppose you? Wed Mar 25 08:54:13 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique Actually it hits the highest spenders most (obviously). I don't want to see any taxes rise. You are mixing me up with Labour. Wed Mar 25 08:05:32 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique Don't agree with you. Very progressive of this Government to take 3m of the lowest paid out of paying any income tax at all Wed Mar 25 07:59:00 GMT 2015
@Dick_Puddlecote @georgedavid678 Thank you - very kind Tue Mar 24 20:34:52 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique No sensible Chancellor rules out things as who knows what will happen in the world economy for 5 years. The intention is clear Tue Mar 24 17:17:01 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique People will believe what they want to believe. The question is who do people trust to manage the economy best - no contest. Tue Mar 24 16:49:15 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique I think this Government's track record on the economy has been pretty good. Always happy to compare it to Labour's. Tue Mar 24 16:40:54 GMT 2015
@Mr_Plastique We have no plans to increase taxes (including VAT) in the next Parliament. Labour are pledged to increase taxes but not VAT. Tue Mar 24 16:34:55 GMT 2015
Cameron makes a statement of the bleeding obvious. Westminster hacks (who know better than anyone it's a statement of the obvious) go wild Tue Mar 24 10:16:35 GMT 2015

@Dazpower Happy for you to campaign on you not believing anyone on benefits with children should ever be sanctioned whatever their behaviour Mon Mar 23 17:38:23 GMT 2015
@Dazpower So you are further to the left of Labour - even they don't subscribe to your view. I believe in parental responsibility Mon Mar 23 17:27:23 GMT 2015
@Dazpower So I presume you think nobody with children should ever be sanctioned come what may? Positioning yourself to the left of Labour? Mon Mar 23 16:48:39 GMT 2015
@baildonwoody Yes, I am pursuing this.  Please email me with your full postal address and I will send you any responses I receive. Sat Mar 21 21:07:32 GMT 2015
@BearBoating I think you are mixing me up with Bradford Council. I will again pursue this with them - please email me with your address Sat Mar 21 00:46:57 GMT 2015
@SaltaireSam As it was Labour MPs who went to prison not sure you are best placed to throw mud. Shame Labour have nothing positive to offer Sun Mar 15 19:12:43 GMT 2015
@iredalepolitics Hmmm. So you helped people to avoid paying tax by persuading them to pay tax.  That should sufficiently bamboozle Ms Hodge! Sun Mar 15 12:30:49 GMT 2015
@iredalepolitics Well you would be bound to do better than George Entwhistle. It could be worse; you could have to go before Margaret Hodge! Sun Mar 15 12:21:11 GMT 2015
@iredalepolitics Maybe we need an early day motion in Parliament to give your bid some impetus, and have a DCMS select committee hearing. Sun Mar 15 12:11:23 GMT 2015
Great to see @iredalepolitics put in a bid to replace Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear on @daily_politics for Yorkshire - he'd be a great choice! Sun Mar 15 12:03:14 GMT 2015
@Doctorwhizz @StuartLong01 Wide open indeed - based on the previous race, will need a thorough stayer! Fri Mar 13 15:06:38 GMT 2015
@grand_sk No I am not. Philip Hollobone and I had to act as tellers for the other side to ensure a vote took place.  We both support 2% Thu Mar 12 18:05:36 GMT 2015
@BaildonViking Totally share your frustration. Please email me with your full postal address and I will pursue for you with Bradford Council Wed Mar 11 22:26:41 GMT 2015
@pixelstylist @CurvedOpinion I haven't repeatedly blocked this Bill; anyone who emails me gets a full response; 140 characters not suitable Wed Mar 11 15:02:48 GMT 2015
@IainDale Have you never changed your opinion about something Ian? Really? Are you a hypocrite if you change your opinion on something? Tue Mar 10 11:41:13 GMT 2015
@HD2onPBdotcom @IainDale I have never felt heavily whipped. Go to your constituency hustings and ask your candidates if they will rebel Tue Mar 10 11:40:20 GMT 2015
@IainDale Totally irrelevant. Should be done by agreement (as last time) or not at all. We don't elect Presidents in the UK - we elect MPs Tue Mar 10 11:36:31 GMT 2015
@IainDale Shame the BBC didn't adopt the same stance when Blair refused to debate with Hague and Major. Wonder what's different? Party? Tue Mar 10 11:33:16 GMT 2015

@IanLabour @banksthomasw Is that why Labour ignore Menston and punish it at every opportunity? Sat Mar 07 17:35:04 GMT 2015
@adelecarlsen This is hard work.  You did lie about me blocking you (clearly as I didn't) and I wasn't referring to you as a lefty idiot Sat Mar 07 17:34:23 GMT 2015
@number1daz Shame the Labour candidate @SteveClapcote hasn't anything positive to say rather than peddle such lies.  Desperate stuff really Sat Mar 07 17:33:22 GMT 2015
@IanLabour @banksthomasw What does that mean? Sat Mar 07 17:28:38 GMT 2015
@adelecarlsen No - try reading what I said. I said you lied about me blocking you and that I don't block anyone (even lefty idiots) not you Sat Mar 07 17:27:41 GMT 2015
@adelecarlsen @Conservatives I have no idea why you lied - I just know that you did. Probably because of your political blinkers Sat Mar 07 17:25:26 GMT 2015
@number1daz I get used to reading idiotic things on twitter, but I think that has topped the lot. Of course not. Sat Mar 07 17:23:40 GMT 2015

Drew Rogers from Baildon left a message for me to contact him without leaving any contact details. Can anyone on twitter help me contact him Thu Feb 12 14:38:03 GMT 2015
@BetGeoffBanks I think you are more likely to have a sweetheart deal with HSBC than me Geoff :) Mon Feb 09 11:42:17 GMT 2015
@_xtralarge Thanks. My fav phrase is "intolerant small minded socialist who's so blinkered they can't even listen 2 what is actually said":) Fri Feb 06 22:25:03 GMT 2015
@kevinwarnes @notredamecoll Thanks Kevin - it was a pleasure. Very impressed with students passion and knowledge Fri Feb 06 19:24:11 GMT 2015
@therealdanhall I wish I could. I have voted against HS2 but I am in a minority in Parliament. Please email me and I will pursue for you Fri Feb 06 00:08:14 GMT 2015
@mraintree Thank you Thu Feb 05 11:37:02 GMT 2015
@action2015uk @FionaODonnellMP @laurasandysMP Yes, it was great and was delighted to meet Alisha from Baildon who is a great role model Wed Feb 04 15:33:23 GMT 2015
@simonbullock That's why I'm keen they get the cheapest energy, not higher priced energy forced on them by guilt ridden champagne socialists Wed Feb 04 15:05:01 GMT 2015
@simonbullock Thanks - I will keep to my campaign for genuinely lower energy bills rather than a cover campaign for more expensive energy Wed Feb 04 14:41:35 GMT 2015
@simonbullock Yes but only in conjunction with lower energy costs not as an excuse to rack up higher energy costs with more expensive energy Wed Feb 04 14:34:33 GMT 2015
@simonbullock Actually environmental and social commitments make up 9% of energy bills generally and 12% of electricity bills specifically. Wed Feb 04 13:19:50 GMT 2015
@simonbullock Renewable obligation is much higher. It is no good arguing for lower energy bills and higher cost energy. You need to decide Wed Feb 04 12:53:42 GMT 2015
@simonbullock The main problem is the cost of energy. Climate change obligations such as idiotic windmills affect all bills Wed Feb 04 12:22:58 GMT 2015
@simonbullock Yes - that is why I have always argued for the cheapest energy to be sourced rather than the greenest energy Wed Feb 04 11:48:00 GMT 2015
@SteveBakerMP @Rob_Merrick Don't worry Steve; you are a Tory MP so bound to be criticised by Rob aka Labour Party stooge on @Bradford_TandA Tue Feb 03 17:02:12 GMT 2015
@fionamacmp You laughed when I said 2 rapes a week were carried out by people on bail. These were official figures not DM's. Some feminist Tue Feb 03 12:56:14 GMT 2015

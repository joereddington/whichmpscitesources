@HuwieJ yes!
@HuwieJ @B6Darren Edm's simply enable people to say they have "done something" whereas I prefer one to one lobbying of Ministers.
Top night with @CressellyCC at the Begelly Arms. All the usual nonsense on display! http://t.co/6qdMh3dHcA
@HuwieJ @B6Darren they are pointless as they don't bind anyone to do anything, but give the impression of doing so. I would scrap them.
Big thanks to @superfastcymru for tour of new 'cabinets' in Amroth, Tenby area. Ready to switch on in New Year. http://t.co/8UwVyfDVrs
@B6Darren @HuwieJ sorry Darren. Shall I call? Ps. Don't sign EDM's I'm afraid. I promise that they are completely worthless..
Some great contributions to debate on the dairy industry. @DavidHeathMP condemning fact that 1 bottle of water same price as 4 pints milk!

@DWPgovuk @DefenceHQ Good news that BT Openreach now employ 2000 former servicemen and women. Great example to other big companies.
@WalesOnline nearly 50% of my cases now NHS related. Right that we should highlight policy failures and would do even if my own Party.
@SamMMarsden what's the best email/phone to reach you on regarding the Welsh NHS?
@woodcote55 thanks and will be in touch shortly!
Have a view on broadband roll out or BT Openreach? If so let me know (good or bad) in time for my short P'mentary debate on this on Tuesday.
@DyfedPowysFed @SCrabbMP pleasure to see you all. Have a great day!

2.25 mile swim 112 mile cycle and a marathon to round it off. Ironman in full swing in Tenby. http://t.co/IvBEtRA7jd
Average weight of Tenby tourists reduced by 30 kg as ironman comes to town. Great weekend in store. #ironman
@Welshsparx I was a lobbyist and started a charity. We weren't allowed to lobby for a party only on policy even then! Happy to support.
@bbygrove @lee_macgregor all sorted thanks. Lunch soon!
@bbygrove what's your email Emma? Just wanted to check whether you were doing anything on Syria?
@HeleddapGwynfor PS hope you noticed the thanks I got for my part in securing S4C funding though...!
@HeleddapGwynfor Nothing sinister, just the consequence of a survey I did when I was first elected.
@ifanmj @heddgwynfor @HeleddapGwynfor I ought to send over the motion we voted on as it answers most of these points, but is quite long!
@heddgwynfor @ifanmj @HeleddapGwynfor Agreed. Which is just one reason why I refused to commit to military intervention.
@HeleddapGwynfor @ifanmj disappointed that you used those words on such a serious issue. Made it clear I would not support the second vote.
@guyadams not recommended on work computers..!
@guyadams just as farmers should never forget the crucial 'g' when making a google image search for 'Aberdeen Angus'.
4 hour trip to the Oval to watch 4 hours of rain! http://t.co/hdPPIrMvxm
This little thing from "3" is brilliant. Mobile Internet in car, train, pub etc. Pay as you go too. http://t.co/uLCwobXd9s
Fecci's in Tenby - officially in top 50 chippies according to 'Fry' magazine. Good judging. #tenby
For those for whom there is life beyond politics... http://t.co/dSLsLK8zE3
@bbygrove @Carmjournal good luck!
@itscarlhartley I'm 49 for the next twenty nine minutes so can still just manage!
@itscarlhartley @dpsalmon I was worried when I saw this...
@GlynDaviesMP but who advised Parties to accept, and then to return?
And lest I forget Radio Pembrokeshire's legendary Jim Hughes... http://t.co/UTSFeReNFl
Pembrokeshire County Show. Everything that's good about our County. Well done President Mike Davies and army of volunteers!
@itscarlhartley it was great. Lovely people!
Great time at "wings over Carew" this weekend. Lovely group of selfless enthusiasts. And nice cake! http://t.co/QZJdzyZM5z
"Wings over Carew" tomorrow and Sunday. Looks like a brilliant day in store. Gates open at ten. Arrive later to wisely avoid my speech..
With the crew of Angle Lifeboat. Great crowd doing a proper job. Lucky to have them and Tenby. #RNLI http://t.co/YVNuOyyWLU
Another important birth for the nation to celebrate. Sorry about the blanket... http://t.co/H4dyYj12Al
Thanks to the Farmers Arms, Llanybri last night for the most lively session so far! How public meetings should be. Great food too.
Off to say our final goodbyes to two Pembrokeshire personalities this week - Brian Murray and Grahame Barrett. Great, irreplaceable people.
Delighted about royal baby but much more excited by arrival of puppies next week. Expect same coverage! http://t.co/V7gL572YNe
And best example of guts Geraint Thomas finishing the tour with a cracked pelvis - on cobbled streets...#TDF
Brilliant example of how to be gracious in victory - Chris Froome in Paris yesterday.  #TDF
Grateful for the cider break @theplashinn Llanfallteg earlier. Don't need much of an excuse..
@OliverCooper101 North Cerney!
I meet a rollerblading saxophonist in Green Park and David Gower fancies red wine on the NHS..Welcome to the silly season. #onlyinlondon
The fun is over. EU committee adjourns. The House strangely deserted at this hour but for the mice. To think it was once always like this..
11.32 pm and the EU referendum bill has been going 9 and a half hours as Labour/Libs try to kill it off. Now planning breakfast.
If he travels by tube it's a PR stunt, or by army helicopter it's a misuse of public funds. Can a PM ever win?
@Torsvicky87 @itscarlhartley @ProducerOllie also, I still think the heat could have been taken out of this had it been in our manifesto.
@Torsvicky87 @itscarlhartley @ProducerOllie well letters do give a flavour of local feeling and this was by far my biggest post bag.
UK unemployment down 57k, employment up 16k, claimant count down 21k, youth unemployment down 20k. Far too early to celebrate but progress.
@FollyFarmWales congratulations to everyone involved!
@itscarlhartley @Torsvicky87 @ProducerOllie Also, issues like this should have been in our manifesto. That's my position but its passed now!
@itscarlhartley @Torsvicky87 @ProducerOllie interesting exchange. I'm not religious but over 500 wrote against and less than 10 in favour.
There are better views in west Wales but this puts a spring in my step every morning as I go to work http://t.co/FmaviBMQ34
Tenby Long Course weekend. 1000 swimmers. Me not included. #tenby http://t.co/BC6OzugHVm
@bbygrove she says hi and let's meet!
All those who say test cricket is boring please watch today's highlights and then apologise. #ashes
@bbygrove @Carmjournal Congratulations!
In Cardiff so missing all the talk about MP's pay. Lots about what we shouldn't get but what is the right amount? Never an easy one this..
Nice to have Ysgol Dyffryn Taf top engineering students,staff and sponsors in Parliament yesterday. http://t.co/E3jAu91n0E
UK a better place this morning without Qatada. He out-legalled 4 Home Secs over 12 years but fair play to Theresa May, she finally got him.
Before I'm accused of having a whisky fixation my last tweet did of course mean Hague not Haig! Must try harder..
William Haig off to a flying start in EU debate. Worth watching if near a telly. #letbritaindecide
@jameswhartonmp is in danger of giving politicians a good name. #letbritaindecide
A rare friday in Westminster but happy to be supporting @jameswhartonmp launch his EU Referendum Bill. #eureferendum
Nice to see QE Cambria School from Carmarthen in town today. Hope the long trip was worth it! #queenelizabethcambria
@BexBowenEcology try Professor Ian Boyd at Defra
A warm Laugharne welcome for TRH's Charles and Camilla today as part of Dylan Thomas festivities. http://t.co/gpbKNtLmqr
@BexBowenEcology the Gov Chief Scientist. Didn't rule out it being higher too.
Great to be in Pendine today to launch vodafone's plan to improve mobile coverage and Internet speeds. Amazing results!
Good news this morning from Treasury on funding for broadband, roads and rail, so now up to Welsh Gov to deliver in Wales. #cashavailable
And in other news today...talk of upgrading the M4, Google on Internet safety and the ever welcome Guide Dogs keeping us on our toes.
Strong stuff from Mark Williams MP and conservative colleagues in support of legal aid in rural Wales.
@JGForsyth but not if your first language is Welsh...
S4C update. Breaking news is 'no cuts'. Good team effort from all Conservative colleagues!
Lots of behind the scenes activity to safeguard S4C's funding. Important for Wales so fingers crossed..
@RichardBenyonMP @HuntingTim What action will the Gov be taking..?
Looking forward to my monthly grilling at the hands of @itscarlhartley at Radio Pems. He's meaner than Paxman on a Friday...
Great night at The Bont in Llanglydwen. Well worth a visit. Packed room and covered every topic from Syria to the price of diesel.
Impressive demonstration of Brazilians outside my office window, livening up the afternoon.
@davidcornock And hopefully remember that all this has big effect on West Wales businesses..
It's happened again. Stopped by a stranger and accused of being a dead ringer for Brian Clough. Really? http://t.co/VZpBGGTrVs
Fun to see the lively Monkton Priory kids in Parliament this morning http://t.co/hiVuzpTe1j
@Sarzyhughes well that didn't happen last October thankfully. To be honest all jobs are important so good news but plenty more to be done.
A long way to go but good that unemployment is creeping downwards in our part of West Wales.
No contest. If someone passes me a phone Attraction gets the vote on @bgt
Great visit (and breakfast!) with the excellent GDHarries of Narberth. 235 employees and always supporting local businesses. Thank you.
Every week I diligently turn up to Prime Minister's Questions and every week I wonder why..?
Bold speech by @GlynDavies in the energy bill tonight. Never seen him so passionate.
Great turnout for Tavernspite PTA fun run at Pendine in memory of Sulien Luckman.  But I'm too old to be racing fifteen year olds..
Lords vote on gay marriage, a mystery sex scandal and badger wars. A normal week in store it seems...
@itscarlhartley  likewise! Tell me if I'm boring..
Just been asked to help "move stiff" from house in Tenby. Either in big trouble or someone needs to improve their texting skills..
Lively meeting in the Red Lion, Pwll Trap last night. Felt a bit like a certain man called Nigel as I leant on the bar taking questions..
Man dragged from car and arrested for crashing security at Westminster as I left tonight. Sums up fractious week!

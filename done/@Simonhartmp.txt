@Lauradavies2015 so should we have left Labour's 'fuel duty escalator' in place? Thu Apr 23 07:42:10 BST 2015
@DPJHodges bet they won't be doing that in Wales... Wed Apr 22 09:37:15 BST 2015
@michaelsheen that's true, but beware voting for one party knowing that it will improve the chances of one that really turns you off? Sat Apr 18 20:36:44 BST 2015
Glad to see my vote holding up in Queensland Australia. Could be vital! #GE2015 http://t.co/ky3UMgTjhT Sat Apr 18 17:52:29 BST 2015
Not sure how accurate these things are but surely I will end the campaign thinner than I as at the start? #GE2015 http://t.co/JPjyWoTJoi Sat Apr 18 17:48:12 BST 2015
@tudur3 bit petty perhaps? Different local authority which split the times it sent out its PV's. Was trying to be accurate! Sat Apr 18 08:08:13 BST 2015
@ASBO_twins ok! Maybe speak on phone when better or email simon@simon-hart.com Fri Apr 17 11:15:58 BST 2015
@ASBO_twins do you want me to pop back later? Fri Apr 17 11:10:28 BST 2015

Voted for myself this morning as Pembrokeshire postal voting already underway! Am I the first? #GE2015 Tue Apr 14 11:28:30 BST 2015
@MichaelLCrick I have....! Tue Apr 14 08:34:17 BST 2015
@SCrabb2015 @llechidcelt about 500 million quid in fact. So bemused by the ref to "nothing". Just plain wrong.. Sun Apr 12 00:00:43 BST 2015
Of all the possible uses of my election boards this is still my favourite! http://t.co/TolUr9uM7F Fri Apr 10 23:03:34 BST 2015
Recognise this? Making the election campaign all the more enjoyable! http://t.co/QNABKpvt37 Thu Apr 09 21:32:25 BST 2015
@Celtes_Cymru @Plaid_Cymru welcome to put my name on your signs.. Thu Apr 09 20:04:20 BST 2015
@Celtes_Cymru @Plaid_Cymru ha ha! I would feel honoured to assist! Thu Apr 09 17:42:01 BST 2015
@m00chski @huwsilk apart from the new ones up today! Wed Apr 08 17:08:40 BST 2015

@MadocLeonard thanks for the info - will get it sorted! Mon Apr 06 19:08:31 BST 2015
Forget leaders debates and all that, my day was made by this Garganey on the pond by my house. #rarebirdalertuk http://t.co/FpKHFRT0jp Fri Apr 03 00:05:46 BST 2015
Will I be cast into outer darkness? Missing #LeadersDebates in favour of @BearGrylls.... Thu Apr 02 21:39:05 BST 2015
Sorry about that, pressed the wrong button! I meant to say "from concerned local people with their NHS experiences" eye opening for all.. Mon Mar 30 23:44:23 BST 2015
Hosted a day long surgery today for Health Board to hear Mon Mar 30 23:42:43 BST 2015
@HywelDdaHB @WTelegraph please no more excuses about Kelly Thomas. All you need to do is sanction the op.. http://t.co/JDBTej0KHM Mon Mar 30 23:40:19 BST 2015
All this "pre Paxo" and "post Paxo" polling analysis seems to overlook one crucial point. Most people weren't watching...#GE2015 Sun Mar 29 23:18:51 BST 2015
And we're off! 650 of these in circulation so if you want one let me know! http://t.co/0rqWZmSdAu Sun Mar 29 20:23:03 BST 2015
@DPJHodges quite. I hardly know a soul who watched the debates or analysis so not sure poll volatility is even connected to them? Sun Mar 29 10:19:51 BST 2015
@eddiemair spot on as usual as he decodes a few political (and journalistic..) cliches.. http://t.co/dUdJ1SN4ZZ Sat Mar 28 17:29:00 GMT 2015
@TebbattM @AndrewRTDavies telling voters we live in lowest crime area in Wales, and that by saving economy we've avoided far worse outcome.. Fri Mar 27 20:51:19 GMT 2015
@Carmjournal @WTelegraph left W'minster for West Wales for last time in this Parliament. What an honour it has been. Now for the election! Thu Mar 26 15:45:41 GMT 2015
Coming to you this week my last newsletter before Parliament "dissolves" for the election. Comments welcome! #GE2015 http://t.co/nu518FnVIh Sun Mar 22 12:38:58 GMT 2015
@SamCoatesTimes except those who vote by post? Sat Mar 21 15:49:58 GMT 2015
@llechidcelt @adrianmasters84 @Pembrokeshire hate to disappoint you but I agree about the bridge! Have lobbied but decision belongs to PCC.. Wed Mar 18 17:13:24 GMT 2015
@llechidcelt @adrianmasters84 @Pembrokeshire assume you have raised that with your Councillors? Their decision.. Wed Mar 18 16:12:58 GMT 2015
Jobs latest in our area?

Fancy helping my GE campaign? We are out and about across the region pretty well everyday. 35000 houses to visit so DM me if you can! Sat Mar 07 19:20:28 GMT 2015
Agree 100% with @GlynDaviesMP that role of media is to report and comment on elections not orchestrate them. Fri Mar 06 20:35:40 GMT 2015
@bbygrove @CarmarthenNews Today's view from the campaign trail in this very special part of the world.. http://t.co/295V0aXWVS Fri Mar 06 19:41:25 GMT 2015

Interested in what this year's election means for our area? Come and put me thru my paces this Thursday Whitland Mem Hall 730 PM. Informal! Tue Feb 24 12:07:14 GMT 2015
@PBear_Wills @DPP_X99 @CCSimonPrince I never sign EDMs, even the one calling for them to be abolished. Happy to publish all other letters Tue Feb 24 11:35:07 GMT 2015
@PBear_Wills @DPP_X99 @CCSimonPrince EDM's have precious little impact in my view so I am opting for direct approach to Ministers and NPAS Tue Feb 24 11:12:33 GMT 2015
BBC caption writer making minimal effort it seems.... http://t.co/WtDKqW99F4 Sat Feb 14 15:13:32 GMT 2015

Bringing a little humour (I hope!) to a long election campaign...something a little different @davidcornock http://t.co/IVUMtn5soV Mon Feb 09 19:29:54 GMT 2015
@andybolton yes. It's meant to look non partisan and provoke a comment or two! Sun Feb 08 23:49:52 GMT 2015
Coming to a letter box near you..Trying a new style of (positive!) leaflet to generate a bit of talk.. http://t.co/nkNaL2xyC4 Sun Feb 08 23:35:28 GMT 2015
@IsabelHardman don't be jealous! You can't see what's behind me... Sat Feb 07 17:42:33 GMT 2015

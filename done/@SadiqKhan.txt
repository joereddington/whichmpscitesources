Biggest threat to our human rights comes not from European judges in Strasbourg,says @amyruthwilliams on @LeftFootFwd http://t.co/Ykv47b4H5S
Good @LabourList piece by John Whitting QC – “we will all have rights, but some will have more rights than others”
http://t.co/NrkO0rS9vH
Human rights protect the poor & voiceless - Cameron's replacement for them is a dangerous sham. My @IndyVoices piece http://t.co/LpXxwwkqXT
Tory #HumanRights plans drawn up on back of an envelope –shows what they think of British people’s fundamental rights http://t.co/N9c0zwz5yr
"The Human Rights Act should be defended and not repealed" - strong editorial in today's @guardian  http://t.co/sOmBplzE0A
Scathing critique of Tory plans to abolish the #HumanRightsAct & withdraw from ECHR by former Tory AG Dominic Grieve http://t.co/NhXoYE5Qrh
I'll be live on @bbcnews channel shortly to say why the Tory human rights plans are so foolish & would damage our country
I’m proud of both the #HumanRightsAct & our membership of the European Convention on Human Rights – RT if you agree
Labour is opposed to foolish Tory plans - we are proud of #HumanRightsAct & will defend our membership of Euro Convention on #HumanRights
£2800 per month to rent: affordable? @MayorLondon thinks so! @TomCopley @Sarah_Hayward speaking sense in @guardian http://t.co/RG37OuFteM

Next year the Magna Carta is 800 & the Tories want to celebrate by stripping the British people of their rights http://t.co/uj3K3D6NKG
Good piece from @SophiaSleigh on our crossing campaign & @wandbc failure to listen to local residents @wandsworthnews http://t.co/4yhVFZuHCL
Before any further announcements, Grayling should read this in @DailyMirror on European Convention on Human Rights http://t.co/SICdhGAsqI
Before any further announcements, Grayling should read this in @DailyMirror on European Convention on Human Rights http://t.co/CTYG9pUnzE
How will the Tory British Bill of Rights differ from the #HumanRightsAct? What rights will the Tories deprive from the British people?
Cameron needs beginner's guide to our constitution - #HumanRightsAct IS a British Bill of Rights! Maybe Dominic Grieve can give a tutorial?

Welcome Grayling's conversion to @uklabour policy of a #victimslaw - funny how he time & again rubbished the idea!http://t.co/Bi8YMBLyf6
Enlightened pro #humanrights Tories like Grieve & Clarke sacked: with Churchill's support for #humanrights Cameron would have sacked him too
Grayling's ignorance of #humanrights frightening - peddling myths not befitting of a Lord Chancellor who swears oath to uphold rule of law
Speech by Grayling is truly shocking - complacent & ignorant about prisons & probation chaos - fantasy politics won't solve #prisonscrisis

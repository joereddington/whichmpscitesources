@GeorgiaArlott Spot on. Appalling logic in Farage/UKIP remarks. Thu Mar 12 13:18:49 GMT 2015
3/3 If U can scrap race laws if U claim to be "colour blind" is it ok to scrap unfair dismissal laws if U say U wouldn't sack ppl unfairly? Thu Mar 12 09:08:11 GMT 2015
2/3 So if being "colour blind" means U scrap race laws, Mr Farage, does it mean if U are not anti-women you scrap sex discrimination laws? Thu Mar 12 09:06:18 GMT 2015
1/3 Farage "logic" on scrapping discrimination laws could be applied to other protections at work. Disgraceful  http://t.co/yNlixR6xcG Thu Mar 12 09:04:12 GMT 2015

@Moonie_l Somehow the image of Michael Gove granting me three wishes doesn't quite compute :-)

@shablibi eg Less frequent checks on whether driver should be licensed. No guarantee firm customer calls is same one minicab will come from
Ministers' decision to force minicab deregulation thro' Lords y'day came despite Councils, taxi drivers & victims groups warning of dangers
It took Qs from me to get Govt to publish impact assessment of their minicab deregulation - 3 months after they forced it through Commons
Y'day Ministers pushed through changes to minicab regs that will put passengers at risk. I've just been on BBC saying why @UKLabour said no.

@DavidVick5 @hammersmithandy @UKLabour Yes but there are progressive voices in Israel who take a different view. They have friends here too

@owais00 There are 2 amendments. One is positive. The other would give Israel a veto over UK decisions on recognition. I oppose that one
@kathpreston1 Interesting. Can't be there but please keep me posted on what comes out of it. Lots of potential for smart transport choices

Talking of G. Osborne, his Tues flag waving visit to Kings Norton (complete w/hard hat &cheerleader) seems to have got right up ppl's noses
Osborne claimed world economic crisis was all Labour's fault but UK now innocent victim of Euro crisis.Convenient eh? http://t.co/VJrf6YxOva
@Ohdogoaway I know the feeling!
Shallowness of Tories' boasts on tackling youth unemployment exposed. Shallowness of their approach to devolution too http://t.co/N58DUOhPZy

@lookatjo OK. I don't think the record bears that out but I think we'll probably have to agree to differ about  that.
Amazing how quickly the hollowness of the promises in David Cameron's #CPC14 speech is being being exposed tonight - eg on #newsnight
@lookatjo You can see reports on that & some of the other things I have been saying & doing over the years on mgr at http://t.co/MJsF72Uyjn
Near 10yr delay over MG Rover management pensions is impenetrable mess - read http://t.co/Po9aCgQzpT via @birminghampost
From today you no longer need to display a tax disc on your car. Ministers must listen to penalty fine concerns - http://t.co/4odrGp2Ipo
.@UKLabour has pledged extra £2.5 billion to pay for 20,000 more nurses & 8,000 GPs. For all his smoke & mirrors Cameron has failed to match
5/5 Cameron’s promises on the NHS have been shown to be not worth the paper they are written on. You can’t trust the Tories with the NHS.
4/5 Before the last election, Cameron promised to protect the NHS ... but its getting harder to see your GP and waiting times are going up
3/5 In 2010 Cameron promised ‘no top-down reorganisation’ - then brought in the biggest ever, siphoning £3 billion out of front-line care
2/5 Before last general election,  Cameron promised ‘real-terms increases’ ... but then cut NHS spending in his very first year in office
1/5  know they how vulnerable they are on #NHS so went for smoke and mirrors big time at #CPC14 yesterday Next 4 tweets give examples of why
How @bbcmtd reported today's announcement of Birmingham & Doncaster winning #HS2 College http://t.co/TJio3BA4iM

Interviewed earlier by @bbcmtd for  report to be screened at 6.30pm on news of #HS2 College coming to #Birmingham. http://t.co/S4pdCEC6Xo

David Cameron vs 420,000 disabled people &, if not enough, more attacks on way according to Osborne at #CPC14 http://t.co/mIvl99kRSp
Is the Tory Party which passed a law to gag charities now threatening businesses which say things they don't like? http://t.co/VB19hpOVzS

My take on the Tory rent-a-crowd being bussed in to Northfield today - minus a defection or two, of course! http://t.co/kaO5JcqKij
So there you have it. Birmingham cut by Govt at 2x national average & Tory PPC cheers Cameron rather than backs Brum https://t.co/N32apUcqLo
@Hargreavesorig Seems Tory HQ laying on free coaches from ICC @ 2.30 to bus their rent-a-crowd to Northfield to tell local ppl what to think
Confirmation Mark Reckless was one of Tories' rent-a-crowd to be  bussed into Northfield 2moro. Publicity called it their "Roll of Honour"
Tory rent-a-crowd being bussed into Northfield 2moro. I reckon local ppl don't like being lectured by David Cameron http://t.co/ziGbBKKExT

@SaraLBA.@martinlinton is lucky to have you to offer such an eminently reasonable penalty. But I'd duck when he's back if I were you :-)
@SaraLBA @Lab2Palestine OK Let's see: 48 hrs stay agreed- if @martinlinton agrees extra penalty. I await his proposals for what it could be!
@rachaelvenables The very idea! But Bournville Garden Centre did look at me strangely as I asked for sand, a bucket & some plastic sheeting

"What would Israelis say to families of civilian casualties in Gaza?" asks Israeli human rights group http://t.co/eBxRpqXMhM
Shooting of suspected informants in Gaza appalling & to be condemned. Extra-judicial killing should be condemned whichever side does it

UN Gaza humanitarian Situation Report Friday Aug 22. http://t.co/5QVCTU9M4t
@SE25A Probably not far off there. Actually there were interesting parallels- especially on how much to focus on past & how much on future
Today had discussion on resolving Israel/Palestine conflict then one on resolving conflict over siting of a bus stop. Which more difficult?
@revdavetubby That's certainly true as well. Creating these posts shouldn't have been priority, particularly for a Govt cutting the Police
@andrewJ46 @D_C_Jamieson @UKLabour There really shouldn't have been the rush. But some ppl decided to trigger the election & that caused it
@baza451 That's bad. Worth contacting elections office with yr address to make sure they have you registered. Let me know if probs doing so
@peparkin @damienhealy .Confident @D_C_Jamieson will represent everyone in area well as Bob Jones did. See too my 2 part reply to @andrewJ46
2/2 @andrewJ46 @D_C_Jamieson @UKLabour...Last PCC election low t/o anyway though. All parties must work harder to engage with ppl generally
1/2@andrewJ46 @D_C_Jamieson @UKLabour Fair point. Aug was a  silly time to have election & I hope it's made ppl who called it reflect on it
Congratulations @D_C_Jamieson. Great  win. You will be an excellent Police & Crime Commissioner for West Midlands #wmpcc14 @UKLabour

Truth is, we inherited + are now repairing the worst public finance crisis in peacetime history from Labour, whilst increasing #NHS pay+exp.
Health Secretary @Jeremy_Hunt makes clear the double pay rise for all NHS staff would have cost 4,000 jobs this year @BBCr4today
And senior and respected Labour MPs like Frank Field are saying Labour's NHS position is untenable: http://t.co/CNIv5yceG0
Even Andy Burnham admits the Unions demands aren't realistic: http://t.co/DJWBBP21ET

Healthy democracy w more autonomy +localism in Scotland, England, Wales + NI essential to renewing a healthy democratic settlement for 21stC
Even the SNP in Scotland now agreeing w @David_Cameron that Labour MPs cannot support Devolution in Scotland but not in England.
The reason Labour are in a tailspin and ducking the W Lothian Q w Regionalism is because they rely on Scottish MPs to govern in England.
The DevoMax deal demands we finally confront the WLothian Q: why can ScottishMPs vote on Eng issues which EnglishMPs have devolved in Scot?
As a Tory Reformer, dlghtd that the passion for democracy unlocked by the #indyref is chanelled into a new Constitutional Settlement for UK

#indyref fallout 6: toxic mix of resurgent narrow English nationalism w ISIS-fuelled islamophobia? Mainstream Conservatism never more needed
#indyref fallout 5: likely to fuel deepening groundswell 'anti-Party Politics' tide and lead to more local and independent voting in 2015?
#indyref fallout 4: likely to fuel demands for a less Party partisan mainstream politics, and a greater emphasis on Country before Party.
3. #indyref also likely to polarise attitudes to #Europe? Some seeing EU as natural protector of small nations, others wanting 'Ind from EU'
2. Whatever the outcome, #indyref will fuel calls for a new constitutional settlement, inc devolution for England
Also a day the implications of the #indyref, whatever the outcome, become clear: 1:politics has touched a whole generation + people DO care
In the year we remember those who gave their lives for the UK, today we wait to see if AlecSalmond+Co  dismantle it http://t.co/Z1avdexeKv
Or the day we started to value who we are+what we've built together, and that we are, as a society, democracy and economy, #bettertogether?
And so it dawns: D Day for the United Kingdom. Will it be the day the Scots dismantle the Great nation of Britain we built together?
Finally GordonBrown shows what we never saw when he was PM: inspiring+ passionate speech on case for #Union #indeyref http://t.co/sa1siztG1C
As Scots consider #indyref, a reminder that their flagship #LifeSciences sector (35,000jobs) would lose £400m PA from Lobdon it relies on.

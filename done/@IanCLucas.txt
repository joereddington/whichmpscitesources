@robertabwMP Let's see what the Tory Manifesto says. "No plans" to increase tuition fess, I suspect... Thu Mar 05 11:14:46 GMT 2015
Interesting that Cameron refused to rule out increasing tuition fees at yesterday's #PMQs Thu Mar 05 11:04:12 GMT 2015
The Tories also said in 2010 that they had no plans to increase VAT and then increased it to 20%. Thu Mar 05 11:02:44 GMT 2015
@gomplusdog My message that the Tories have broken their 2010 promise to eliminate the deficit by 2015 is clearly getting through. Thu Mar 05 11:01:44 GMT 2015
@gomplusdog @campbellclaret Perhaps Cameron wants to duck explaining why he broke his 2010 promise to eliminate the deficit by 2015? Thu Mar 05 10:48:07 GMT 2015

I think we can safely say after today's #PMQs that we have a Prime Minister determined to avoid TV debates. Wed Mar 04 13:33:43 GMT 2015

@MShapland it was included in the Coalition Agreement the Lib Dems agreed to. Mon Mar 02 18:33:16 GMT 2015

Yet again 2 of 5 carriages on Euston - Bangor train First Class and a single Virgin ticket to Wrexham is Â£137 standard. Ridiculous. Thu Feb 26 15:58:15 GMT 2015

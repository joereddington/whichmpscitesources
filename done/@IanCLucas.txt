@bbclaurak How much taxpayer's money was wasted on Osborne's ridiculous legal challenge? #otherpeoplesmoney
7.4% fall in wages in Wrexham in the last year: people are worse off. In a parallel universe, the Tories complain about the Mansion Tax....
Average wages in Wrexham have fallen by 7.4% in the last year: less money available in the local economy I to benefit local business.

Yesterday I met 3 Remploy workers sacked by this Govt last year. They are still jobless and were looking for work when I met them.
Fact: the deficit has increased by over 10% in the last year.  Tories are failing in their own terms and our most vulnerable pay the price.
Uncollected tax has risen by £3 bn in the last year under the Tories. Hedge Fund managers donate to the Tories. Are these facts related?

@hocwatch @itvnews What confusion? Tory debt even worse than the deficit.
@itvnews Tell George Osborne the deficit increased by 10% in the last year. He is under a misapprehension that he knows what he is doing.

@Markfergusonuk @stephenkb @CCHQPress Appalling judgment.
@JBeattieMirror Sickening but entirely predictable that Murdoch uses a charity to pursue his vendetta against @Ed_Miliband
#bbcWIWO North Wales does not exist for you.NE Wales is of massive economic importance to Wales but is just ignored.
The unspoken key to better Welsh devolution is more devolution WITHIN Wales
Just imagine what it would be like if we had BBC Local Radio in Wales @BBCShropshire @BBCRadioWales
Kurds and Arabs alike were asking for UK support against IS at Manchester this week.
@IWA_Wales @Amanwy We need a Constitutional Convention for the UK.
Always remember: the Tories voted against the creation of the NHS.
The cult of youth is much overrated. http://t.co/oS8BFaODMV
Erlas Victorian Wallef Garden   @wrexham : refreshing us with nature! http://t.co/Gqe5VPrULu
A pleasure to be discussing Ethiopia's progress hosted by World Vision.
When this PM wants to change our Constitution, he invites a few Tory mates round to Chequers. The UK is not a dining club.
@EdMiliband_MP highlights the importance of green jobs. Cameron wants to get rid of "green crap".
"I'm really important. I'm Prime Minister. I get to talk to the Queen and tell people what she says..."
@wrexham Enjoying Ed's speech - @ianclucas Eileen and @susanwxm_1 http://t.co/NlM52we45f
@EdMiliband_MP highlighting the centrality of Israel and Palestine to his overseas vision.
A combination of broad vision and specific policies to benefit  our people.
From Labour Conference good luck to @Wrexham_AFC in tonight's big derby with Chester
Very pleased to see Kevin Wilkin the @wrexham Manager at the Gresford Disaster Commemoration - understanding importance of event to the town
A memorable service on a beautiful morning in Gresford. http://t.co/Tz1E6EXgRg
80 years ago, 266 miners died at Gresford Colliery. I will be at the Memorial Service at Gresford Wheel at 11 am. http://t.co/GV3n0uC7yw
Cameron is packing the Lords with Tory stooges in the self-interested pursuit of political advantage.
How can we have real constitutional reform in Parliament that leaves out the House of Lords?
@itvnews @johnrayitv The Angel of the North is in GATESHEAD which is a town.
Fun photo shoot at Gwersyllt Post Office with Darren and Rachel. Best wishes to them both. http://t.co/kFzTbWQ4N9
Peter Hennessey and Vernon Bogdanor both slaughtered Cameron's proposals on the radio today. Dave's timetable is simply ludicrous.
We must also consider improving how devolution works within Wales to make it more effective for the whole country.
Great to meet up with Sophie and David at Holt County Primary School - correct this time with apologies! http://t.co/r5S9dQU62i
@brianpilman Correct thanks!
The First Minister of Wales is absolutely right that constitutional reform must be wholistic and that a piecemeal approach will not work.
Home Rule defeated Gladstone. Dave says he'll sort it with a Cabinet Committee in 6 months.
Looking forward to visiting Holt Primary, @wrexham, walking distance from the English border, sporting my "No" badge.
Peter Hennessey talking much more sense than the Prime Minister this morning on @BBCRadio4
Great that the @DailyMirror supported the Union and the @TheSunNewspaper bottled it.
Two birthday presents yesterday: this and a No vote. http://t.co/iHKJD7BWMh
Two birthday presents yesterday: this and a No vote. http://t.co/vnzSoQUDXL
The key to reforming our constitution is to deal with on a UK basis, not piecemeal, country by country. It must involve Lords' reform.
@CPJElmore Shouldn't you be in bed?
I am looking for North Lanarkshire now. In Airdrie and Hartshill earlier this week.
@carlsargeant1 Good morning.
More info, less chatter on ITV: looks gloriously old-fashioned but the place for results.
@ChrisBryantMP @DavidWooding Liverpool, for example. Have you seen the Pier Head recently?
Good to meet Edinburgh North and Leith and Airdrie and Shotts' comrades in the Campaign: thinking of you tonight.
Remembering the Gresford Disaster 80 years ago on 22 September. 265 miners died. Be at the Wheel 11 am. http://t.co/8A7r9qU4YF
@BellisBrothers Absolutely worth it. Home made is best.

The Nationalists kept asking me where I was from: it seemed to be the only thing that mattered to them.
Nationalism breeds division, aggression and conflict. I saw it myself in Scotland this week.
Excellent meeting with Friends of Gresford Colliery Disaster - preserving the heritage of Wrexham's darkest day, 22 September 1934.
Proud to visit birthplace of Keir Hardie with @pamela_nash . A Scot, MP for a Welsh seat, he believed in solidarity! http://t.co/ADlrwhS1oR

@NeilShone1 @unitetheunion I am. I have written again to him and he will find a lot of Parliamentary Questions in his in tray.
@NeilShone1 @unitetheunion Andrew Selous. When I was a Minister, I never refused to meet an MP.
Met with @UnitetheUnion to talk about securing local employment on North Wales Prison project. Minister has refused to meet me to discuss.
Attending Debate on Ukraine, Middle East, North Africa and Security with many thoughtful contributions on all sides of the House.
Wonderful to see @PrideMovieUK : uplifting, funny and teaching us value of solidarity.
A Court with no cells: the ludicrous situation that will exist at Wrexham when the Police Station closes in 2016. MoJ refuses to address it.

I am going to Chester today to deliver this message. #Labourdoorstep #bedroomtax http://t.co/gt5MPz2N2J
Higher morale, more discipline and better organisation: the reason more Labour MPs voted today than Tories #bedroomtax
Morning delivery in Wrexham would be a really good idea. http://t.co/JyS63tgU37
Outrageous that Sunday delivery pilot will be "within M25 area" - Royal Mail fracturing as a national organisation http://t.co/JyS63tgU37

Tories doing everything they can today to stop bedroom tax exemption for disabled people. And failing...

Sounds like Tories and Lib Dems are reversing policy on Control Orders.
IDS refuses to specify which benefits the PM will seek to renegotiate with the EU. Do they talk to each other? Probably not.

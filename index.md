# The always-up-to-date ranking of UK MPs on how well they cite sources.



This page is a list of UK MPs in order of how likely they are to give the source for figures they use.

The page automatically updates once a week.

The ranking uses MP’s Twitter streams. The method is a little bit of a blunt instrument, but it makes some points nicely.

The list works like this:

*   gather recent tweets by MPs.
*   take those that involve numbers (because we are interested in if the MP references their figures)
*   check if they contain a URL.

So this is good:

…and this is bad:

We’re looking at the most important part of information sharing here. If we are to have grown-up conversations we must use information that can be checked. The first step is simply information is saying where your information came from.

You can view the first list [here](http://joereddington.com/4534/2014/11/24/the-list-of-uk-politicians-most-likely-to-be-making-up-facts./). I checked how good the idea was with humans [here](http://joereddington.com/5153/2015/04/28/does-your-mp-cite-their-sources-or-do-they-make-up-the-facts-find-out-here/) and it worked very well. I’m certainly happy that the list is the most simple and visible way of making MPs aware of the information they are putting out.

All of the code is in [GitHub](https://github.com/joereddington/whichmpscitesources), and if you’d like to look at the list a single MPs you will find it [here](http://joereddington.com/mps_always/full/).

For the first list, [someone on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/34ht2x/how_likely_is_your_mp_to_cite_sources_ranking/cqux0mj) said something very important:

> I think it’s pretty clear that the top 20% of those MPs are doing something right methodologically, compared to the bottom 20%. But I’d be careful of singling out any individual case with such a blunt tool. Especially if all 5 are from the same party

…and you should take that as your general guide. If your MP is in the bottom half of the table, there is probably something wrong…
